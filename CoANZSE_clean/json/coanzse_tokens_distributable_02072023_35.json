picking out you ready the sun is peeking out the sun is peeking out peeking here and peeking there the sun is peeking out peekaboo all right today 's story is a long one so i 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one together this one is called home in the rain and it 's by bob graham and it 's published by walker books and it 's a lovely story shall we read it together let 's go all right we 've got this first page here can you see all of that rain coming down oh it 's so heavy isn 't it have you ever been in the traffic in the city with lots and lots of rain pouring down look at that didn 't it rain it hit the highway bucketing down on francie and her mum and her baby sister on their way home from grandma 's look at it it rained on endless lines of cars and buses oil tankers and trucks the windscreen wipers in despair but the rain was going nowhere except down francie mum and baby sister a long way from home a big rig passed on a long-haul trip headed for heaven knows where it rocked them in road spray and washed them up into the picnic area look at that oh dear it 's a bit scary sometimes when those things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hill and a baby rabbit dived for cover it rained on a field mouse wet and confused in the blackberries and lucky too because 300 feet up a kestrel had lost sight of its prey look at that the rain actually saved that mouse 's life look at that it rained on the canal turning the water white and it rained on the fishermen wet as the fish below young marcus water running down his neck his fingers smelling of bait wished he was somewhere else oh dear while the water ran off the backs of the ducks they loved the rain the rain soaked two men on the western highway interchange they argued while steam rose from their hot engines oh dear can you see all of that traffic there stuck in the rain look at these guys there they 're having a bit of an argument and not looking where it was going the countryside ran straight into the edge of the highway bringing with it the faint smell of farmyards francie mum and baby sister such a long way from home inside france 's car the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the side window have you ever done that look at that she 's got francie there she wrote her mum 's name with her fingers squeaking on the glass and then her dad 's name her dad working far out to sea gone three weeks now she wrote it clear across the front window look at that daddy my little sister what will her name be mummy well she 's not quite with us yet said mum but when will she have a name mummy said francie soon said mum sometime soon francis are a whole back window just waiting for a name a window just waiting for france 's wet finger could it be alice maybe or isabel emma or um zoe well they 're nice francie said mum but there 's a name somewhere out there that will fit her just right they ate the picnic grandma had packed plum jam sandwiches and hard-boiled eggs with a little sprinkle of salt they shared the two stale toffees found under old parking tickets in the door when is daddy coming home said francie soon replied mum sometime soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small movement against her ear well yes said mum brushing crumbs from her knees like the new baby then the radio played this is 3lfm your spot on the radio it 's wet on the road so take care folks it sure is wet look at it francie and her mom and her baby sister pulled back out into the traffic far off down the road they found a service station hail hit the roof and oil on the puddles made rainbows around francie 's toes oh look at that that 's fun what about what was about to happen would not be noticed by anyone not a sam not by sam miller feeding his dog fried chicken legs not by cake colder losing her sour fruity fizzies from a hole in her pocket not even by a seagull who was eating them what 's going to happen perhaps it was something unremarkable not to be seen by strangers passing in the rain for it was just a mum lost in her thought and a small girl dancing francie come here said mum grace your new sister will call her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as best as she could with francie 's little sister grace in between the three of them they staggered and toppled a bit did a slow and awkward little dance of their own until france 's feet found the ground again francie had a feeling francie knew that right here with the smell of petrol her feet all wet on this driveway in the rain that she would remember that moment forever wait until daddy hears said francie daddy will love that replied mum and way back down the highway francie 's grandma sipped tea rabbits and field mice were deep in their burrows young marcus headed home for a hot bath and somewhere kestrel chicks went without dinner then the sun covered the countryside far off and away from grandma 's place to home and out across the sea their little car now full of courage bumped off down the road the windows rolled down and wind rushed through one window was still fogged up and had france 's fading breath and grace still faintly showing look at that the end and there 's daddy he 's come home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well thank you for being with us today that was a fun story wasn 't it i wonder if you 're going to go out in the rain today is it raining at your place today it 's not raining at my place today but maybe it will later all right let 's say our goodbyes and we 'll see you next time see you later alligator in a wild crocodile give a hug ladybug blow a kiss jellyfish see you soon big baboon out the door dinosaur ra take care koala bear wave goodbye butterfly see you next time bye [Music] [Applause] you"

    "text": "for me the passion just comes from the joy that you see when people eat maybe because i am chinese i always think food should be shared so for me food in general is about sitting down and taking the time i was born in china shanghai and we migrated here as a family when i was 10. being just a typical family in china my parents they were just very comfortable and then coming here in a new environment suddenly it changed the dynamic i think the language barrier affected their confidence a lot almost feels like me living a life that is a lot more assimilated than my mom i was a dentist i was building my career and i 'll tell her about it but she 's looking in from the outside a bit [Music] opening up a restaurant has been something that sat in the mind of my mom and i for a long time before we did it she used to own a little noodle box shop and then she sold it and never really getting any good ideas of what she might do next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit stuck then one day i called my mum and i said hey i saw this place that looked available it 's in a really good spot after that everything just started happening chinese food especially dumplings it was more like fast food in melbourne there is so much history and there is so much art in chinese food i wanted to create an environment that really sets the scene and invites people to take the time and sit down and enjoy it our dumpling artists they are just amazing when people walk past our window so many people love watching when they 're doing it they 're doing it so effortlessly i think we 're all kind of a bit captivated whenever we see someone that is an expert the way we run chibao is we try to do what we do best i manage the front of house and i manage how we present the food and my mom manages the kitchen working so closely with my mum i think the project itself gave us a lot of meaning we 've had so many fights and healthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her working and being a leader again and being so great at being a leader it 's just very nice it 's just very fulfilling being part of yarraville there is this infectious nature everyone was there to look after each other i always felt yarrabil had a lot of diversity chibao was an opportunity almost for me to show off my culture it just feels like you 're giving people something a little bit more than food you 're giving people a sense of pride in their community you"

    "text": "[Music] do i 've got this towel uh from home it 's got a couple of stains bleach marks on it and that sort of thing um uh so it seemed that it is a bit scratchy um i 'm gonna turn this into some washcloths they 're one of the most useful things we have around our house that 's for sure we don 't use anything else to wipe anything or clean anything um except these cloths that i get from old towels so it 's super straightforward super easy and i bet you 'll be using them around the house non-stop something but i usually make them about the size of a tissue or else sometimes it 's good to make them kind of the size of your hand so you know if you 've got smaller hands maybe make them smaller and if you 've got really big hands maybe make them bigger because i find hand size is the size that you 're after [Music] and i 've got one finished wipe here which is perfectly good washable washable washable over and over and over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of you might not have overlockers um not everyone does obviously um so i 've just got my domestic sewing machine here and i 've just set it on a wide a fairly wide zigzag like a five here and a short stitch so about one and a half or two in length and about a five in width and obviously zigzag and then i 'm just going down the edge of the pre-cut square instead so you can kind of hang the stitch off the edge each time so come in and then off the edge um obviously don 't try to sew on nothing um completely because that might bog up the machine a bit but as long as you 're kind of somewhat mostly on the cloth it should be fine so you can see i 'm just going to come down that edge you can see i 'm just hanging that stitch off that edge anyway and so you can just see a really fine zigzag down there and that will keep that from fraying now in the wash as well it 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off in that first wash you might find you have a lot of those little bits so make sure you do that separately to the rest of your laundry maybe the first time just run them through um but over time that 'll definitely hold hold in hold in the phrase just as well [Music] so as a as a cloth wipe i just fold these i know a lot of people have a box that they put them in and store them in but honestly we just have a stack of them like this and then we always have our handy tomato sauce bottle it 's empty it 's been washed out inside i put water with a tiny bit of the baby bath oil the qv bath oil this you could use a spray bottle but i find the spray bottle doesn 't get these wet enough quickly enough you 're always having to do it pretty quickly i 'm sure you all know with your nappy changes you don 't have time on your hands often so this will just wet this really quickly and really easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bum bundle them in with your cloth nappy wash them all the same so you can see here i 've got an old lace curtain um that i just find in op shops and that sort of thing if they 're really nice i leave them in the op shop because you know some people genuinely might use them as curtains but if there 's something kind of gross i don 't i can 't really feel this but it feels really plasticky um i 'll buy it and i 'll cut it up and make it into produce bags instead they 're super lightweight so they won 't add you know extra weight to your vegetables and fruit when you 're weighing them um and there is it a sew because it doesn 't fray very much this stuff um some of the other stuff does so i 'll talk you through that too um but something like this when it 's a curtain i like it because there 's already a channel i mean obviously there 's the the gathering up threads through here but there 's also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thread through you know a chord and um afterwards and i can make it a drawstring without much effort on my own part because it 's kind of already pre-done all right let 's sew these up [Music] okay so we 've got it folded out the right way now we 've got the seams on the inside there so i haven 't overlocked or edged this because i know it 's not going to fray away um but i 'll talk about you know the sort of fabrics that do in a second but here we 've got a finished one this is kind of you know you can see it 's double hand size so this is good for like bananas or something like that and then we 've got the double drawstring so we 've got it threaded through both sides so you can just pull this up like this and then you can tie these up if you need to secure it super handy and super quick maybe took me about i don 't know eight to ten minutes okay so now i 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got stains on it and everything so it 's kind of unusable for anything else um and it also sort of tends to have a bit more fraying to it like it can kind of unravel and you know come away like that so it would be prone to slowly kind of fraying away in the wash so we 'll kind of treat it in a different way if you have an overlocker just overlock your seams um that will easily definitely be the easiest way uh but if you don 't have an overlocker that 's fine too we 'll just do some french seams instead so this piece i 've cut double so it 's on the fold at the bottom and so we 've only got two seams to go up each side and then we 'll do the top [Music]"

started to sob [Applause] she enjoys all the noise they called to the crowd if we wanted her to settle we 'd need to be loud and they knew straight away that the right thing to do was to start the

    "text": "[Music] hi everyone it 's zoe from a little bit better approachable coaching for everyday earth keeping so i think food waste is a huge uh proportion of what we dispose of in the kitchen especially um it 's sort of unavoidable when it comes to kids they 'll be halfway through their apple and get tired of the taste so i can 't avoid it but let 's at least rethink how we dispose of our food waste so i do try to think about you know before composting or disposing of how i might be able to reuse those scraps so this is my top tip for some little concentrated flavor pods you can use the little wilted and withered uh veggie scraps that you 've got in your fridge that you 'll probably want to chuck out we can use those um and put them in the freezer and they can add heaps of flavor to our food so i 'm sure this is pretty familiar to you all especially if you 've got kids half eaten apples oh my god um carrots that are probably grated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut onions seen better days uh sweet potatoes and zucchinis very soft very squidgy zucchinis and of course very limp celery uh so i don 't even compost this stuff um it 's all perfectly edible it 's just it 's kind of gross to eat fresh um and if the kids see you trying to feed it to them they 're going to freak out if they 're anything like mine so i 'll show you what i do with these guys [Music] so as you can hear it 's still kind of sizzling um from the oven it 's all roasted up um all of the little uh leaves that i put on from celery have kind of crisped up nicely it 's up to you whether you put the leaves in or not but they will go a bit like that and that 's completely fine it 's extra flavor you just eat them like that if you wanted to absolutely nothing wrong with them but i uh blitz them and i turn them into little flavor pods that i can put into my kids meals for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goodness [Music] down [Music] so we don 't have a huge yard for multiple compost bins that sort of thing you know we 're in a city living and i think a lot of people probably watching this might be living in apartments and that sort of thing so bokashi bins are really useful for that so we 'll collect our scraps in a little bucket just on the bench saggy little bucket on the bench um during the day and at the end of the day we 'll empty it into our bokashi bin like this and we 'll sprinkle it with the bokashi grains yeah so the bokashi grains just uh speed up the fermentation process uh before you kind of let it sit for 10 days after it 's full um and then we can put it on the compost so bokashi bins are extra special because you can put basically everything in them you can put dairy you can put bread you can put meat scraps uh there 's very few things you can 't put in there which is super helpful when when it comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the bench level so they all come with a tap on them as you can see there 's heaps of this juice that comes out the bottom uh it 's super potent so you need to water this down a lot if you 're going to use it on your plants some say some would say one to one hundred i 'm sure my husband isn 't quite that diligent and they survive a little a little more concentrated than that but um if you use this on its own it 's actually potent enough to act as a drain cleaner so i guess consider that when you 're thinking about how much to water it down but it 's super super um concentrated with heats of nutrients for your plants so as you can see we 've got our super super stylish composted up here and after draining the uh fluid out of the bottom into the jars you just empty that the contents of that bokashi into the compost so you can see we 've added a mix of everything there 's leftovers in there there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ah joe 's just aerating it a bit turning it as best you can given how full it is um but as you can see like that that the kind of soil that you can see coming up now you know that 's the last couple of bakashi bins so it breaks down pretty quickly and it really helps to put that bokashi stage in into your rotation to speed the process up so another really simple thing we can do is cut down the amount of animal products we eat so uh personally not a vegetarian my family eats lots of meat well we don 't eat lots of meat but we eat meat um and i don 't think that that is gonna change uh in the short term so i try to work on reducing it as much as possible and where i do eat it i make sure to source it from the right sort of places so i think first off we can just try to eliminate three dollar 500 gram mince meat packets from the supermarket that 's something that kind of needs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not at that price if you 're anything like me i would prefer not to eat it only once a week but i would prefer to spread that portion across a couple of meals so when i 've got kids obviously so they will eat a lot of mints spaghetti bolognese you know meatballs that sort of thing i am reducing the amount of meat i need in each portion as much as i can so you need to start bulking out um the brown lentils and the tin are perfect for that because the texture is almost exactly the same it just disappears but the flavor of the meat is still there um the discerning meat lover does not know the difference but you 've just halved your portion so when it comes to getting our meat i get it from a regenerative farm here in victoria they deliver it to our door um in compostable plastic wrapping um so that 's 500 grams of beef mince there lots of people would kind of make one meal with that they would just make one roundus bag bowl or you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that but this would easily maybe go three or four times that far once i 'm done with it so say i 'm making spag bowl i 'm really only using half of that and then supplementing it with lentils and tin tomatoes or mushrooms or grated carrot grated zucchini add them as a lot and you 'll be amazed by how far you know i easily make about four portions or eight portions with just this much mince um so that 's how i prefer to have my meat otherwise just go vegetarian for the majority of the week and then just have it once or twice a week you know do what you can try to reduce what you can try to not buy the really bargain bargain beer meat from the supermarket because you know that that will not be coming from a place that thinks about puts the environment first um so try to have a look into a regenerative farm near you because they 're great you know regenerative farming i 'm so excited about it i can do a whole video about it on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can just try to reduce that intake a little bit when it comes to animal products and it will make a huge impact um we can supplement as much as we can you can replace if you want um but personally as i said i prefer to spread out my portions so i still get the taste they still get something that they 're familiar with but i have also halved or quartered our intake so finally i thought i would go through recycling um i think some people might feel a bit limited to what they can put in the curbside services but um if you google it there are tons of solutions for your for your items so if like there 's something that features heavily in your waste each week you know maybe you 've got heaps of milk bottle caps or beer bottle lids or i don 't know it could be anything um you 'll probably find as a solution for it even if the curbside services don 't take them okay so i know you know in our area our council doesn 't take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our recycling station that i have next to our fridge we recycle all the soft plastic you know it 's just um you know bags soft plastic wrappers that go around toys or you know fruit strap wrappers whatever there is that 's all soft plastic anything that can be scrunched in one hand considered soft plastics um we also recycle we have a little box a very baggy box here that we recycle all of our batteries so as batteries run out we have them in that box that 's in one of the drawers as well we 've got another box texas all of our felt tip pens will go in there they can all be recycled by office works as can electrical recycling small electrical recycling you know broken adapters cords that are redundant now old electric toothbrushes that sort of thing and then finally we also have our metals so i sort them separately we 've got um things like the wire cages on the top of champagne bottles alfoil and bottle top lids so we sort those all in our metal basket and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our local uh metal recycler who 's actually a little boy who set up an enterprise of his own so um we sort that all out into aluminium steel that sort of thing and we recycle them through him so don 't feel limited by your curbside pickups there are so many solutions we don 't have bottle caps for our milk because we get our milk refilled in our glass bottles but i know that the plastic lids everyone had a bit of trouble finding recycling options for those for a little while but there is actually a company called resparkle that make plant pots out of the milk bottle lids so you can send them into them so have a little google if there 's something that comes up a lot i 'm sure you 'll be able to find a solution for it so i really hope that that has helped you around the kitchen some super easy tips easy to execute let me know how you go [Music] you"

    "text": "for me the passion just comes from the joy that you see when people eat maybe because i am chinese i always think food should be shared so for me food in general is about sitting down and taking the time i was born in china shanghai and we migrated here as a family when i was 10. being just a typical family in china my parents they were just very comfortable and then coming here in a new environment suddenly it changed the dynamic i think the language barrier affected their confidence a lot almost feels like me living a life that is a lot more assimilated than my mom i was a dentist i was building my career and i 'll tell her about it but she 's looking in from the outside a bit [Music] opening up a restaurant has been something that sat in the mind of my mom and i for a long time before we did it she used to own a little noodle box shop and then she sold it and never really getting any good ideas of what she might do next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit stuck then one day i called my mum and i said hey i saw this place that looked available it 's in a really good spot after that everything just started happening chinese food especially dumplings it was more like fast food in melbourne there is so much history and there is so much art in chinese food i wanted to create an environment that really sets the scene and invites people to take the time and sit down and enjoy it our dumpling artists they are just amazing when people walk past our window so many people love watching when they 're doing it they 're doing it so effortlessly i think we 're all kind of a bit captivated whenever we see someone that is an expert the way we run chibao is we try to do what we do best i manage the front of house and i manage how we present the food and my mom manages the kitchen working so closely with my mum i think the project itself gave us a lot of meaning we 've had so many fights and healthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her working and being a leader again and being so great at being a leader it 's just very nice it 's just very fulfilling being part of yarraville there is this infectious nature everyone was there to look after each other i always felt yaravo had a lot of diversity chibao was an opportunity almost for me to show off my culture it just feels like you 're giving people something a little bit more than food you 're giving people a sense of pride in their community you"

    "text": "[Music] so welcome everyone hi my name is gabrielle and i work at marabanong libraries in melbourne 's inner west we 're thrilled to have you joining us for this global learning festival event a climate proof your garden sustainability workshop by ella from chiptopia firstly i 'd like to acknowledge the traditional owners of the land on which i am joining from today the waranjuri huayrarong nation and i pay my respect to their elders past present and emerging i also acknowledge the traditional owners of the various lands on which you are all joining from today and any aboriginal and torres strait islander people participating in this event if you would like to type in the chat box you can also share where you are joining from today first nations australians are the oldest continuing living culture in the world today as we learn about sustainable gardening and climate change we i reflect that first nations people in australia have been caring for country for at least 60 000 years i 'm so excited to introduce ella the founder of triptopia is about grassroots sustainability being in touch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relaxed and fun workshop run by ella will help you become inspired about closed loop gardening improve food security and make your garden become part of the climate solution some quick housekeeping if you have any questions for ella you can type these in the chat we will also share an event survey in the chat later on and would love if you could complete the survey for us please keep your microphone on mute we will be recording today 's session so if you would prefer to be not on the screen you can turn your camera off without further ado i will now hand over to ella thanks thank you okay welcome everybody um there 's uh so much that we can talk about with sustainability and with climate and gardening so hopefully this gives you a nice high level overview and a snapshot and i guess a bit of inspiration to then take some of these ideas and research them further to apply some of them as some projects in your garden over summer so we 'll look firstly at climate change what 's actually the issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ security of course and then we 're going to um look at sort of mitigation versus adaptation and production and protection and how all these things fit together how can we balance priorities basically uh then we 'll look at lots of different design ideas for resilience so resilience against a lot of the impacts that we see of climate change whether it 's flood or temperature all sorts of things um we will touch on plant selection but again i could spend a whole another hour on that so it 'll be very high level uh as will close loop gardening so um questions as as you 've been advised questions can go in the chat box if they 're topical at the time for clarification of what i 'm talking about we can address them at the time but otherwise we 'll come back to them all at the end so what 's actually the issue with climate change well on a global scale it 's a whole destabilization it 's the changing of the ocean currents and acidification and how they then affect weather patterns and storms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and floods and all sorts of other issues which of course lead to lower rainfall in some areas higher in other higher volumes crop failures and pressure on the food system so again inspiring us to have a bit of that resilience at home uh of course the impact on wildlife and extinction which is a key driver for me is really to care for the wildlife and there 's so much unknown in terms of el nino and la nina uh and it looks like we 're gonna have a very cool wet summer again this year which is very strange and that 's because of a la nina influence but we just don 't know how el nino and la nina actually interact with climate change because human human race has never seen the climate change that we 're experiencing now so so many unknowns so translating that back to some of our local issues in the garden you may have already noticed some of these things like the shifting pollination impacts so if you 've got you know i hear about tomatoes that are still going strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't get tomatoes in winter so um things are shifting things are flowering at different times longer shorter later earlier fruits coming at different times and when you 've got generation after generation of of key pollinators like insects and bats that have been set you know they 've evolved to pollinate at a certain time if that shifts it can just throw the ecosystem into chaos so that then affects breeding cycles and of course food security because we need pollinators to pollinate our food uh and then of course there 's the local impacts that i 'm sure we 've all felt in really hot summers with drought and heat waves droughts in there twice that 's a typo but probably a bit of an omen as well to a point and of course deluge which we 've all experienced just last week flash flooding um and then of course you know fire so it 's not climate change isn 't just a warmer hotter world it 's it 's erratic and it 's extremes and it has impacts on wildlife it has impacts on part of me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very doomy and gloomy and i don 't intend to it to sound and gloomy i just want to give you the context so that you can get a bit inspired to take you know take some of these actions so we 're going to look at mitigation and adaptation versus production and protection so to define that mitigation when we talk about climate change we talk about mitigating climate change or adapting to climate change i 've always been very passionate about mitigating climate change so trying to prevent it trying to reduce the impacts trying to get trees in the ground sequester the carbon do everything we can to reduce the amount of climate change that we 're having um whereas another school of thought is it 's too late we need to just adapt really we need to do both at the same time because we 're already seeing extremes we already need to start adapting to those extremes we need to have gardens that can withstand the deluge withstand the drought potentially withstand fire and all those other impacts so balancing mitigation and adaptation at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good for mitigation but creating green spaces also gives us a refuge because green spaces help prevent flooding and help prevent heat waves so it 's it 's really about getting that balance and working them hand in hand and then production and protection you 'll see i 've kind of linked the colors here so adaptation and production are very human oriented how how are we going to adapt to climate change and how we 're going to make sure we 've still got enough food and be resilient to the impacts and still have a functional garden that we can enjoy whereas protection is sort of more with mitigation it 's about protecting the environment helping to support the environment so helping those local systems still be a little bit self-sustaining and supporting wildlife so but of course there 's benefits for us in protecting the environment and having a balance so what we want to have in our garden is a balance of production and protection we want a productive food garden for food but we don 't want to do that at the expense of habitat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ecosystem collapses anyway so it 's about getting that balance it 's really important to to feature both in our garden in terms of environmental protection and habitat and wildlife as well as growing some food and closing the loop so sounds really overwhelming um but it 's really about just looking at those competing priorities and and finding some sort of a happy medium not just going you know wholeheartedly one way at the expense of something else um and lots of little icons in here just as talking points i suppose if we had more time we could talk about that but um you know humans you know are still still one of these animals that we we treat with when we 're talking about habitat and right to life and everything else you know we we want to make sure that our children and our grandchildren um you know can actually have a a pleasant life a sustainable future um so we want to um obviously care for them as well as for other other animals so in terms of balancing production and protection um we 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in terms of protection we 'll be looking at um our resilience and urban heat island effect and habitat so design using sort of smart design to uh you know create an environment where we can be protected from the extremes and where wildlife can be protected from the extremes and in terms of production we 'll touch on food cultivation um livability and and all that sort of things so you know having a productive garden that 's still still usable um not you know not turning every urban environment into a bush block that would be really nice but hard to grow food on a bush block so it 's about getting that balance um and so now we 'll look through these in order of heatwave fire drought etc and give you some really good tips on how it all goes together so our aim with heat waves drought and fire obviously we try to reduce them but we want to be resilient to them so i 'm going to talk about urban heat island effects and heat waves what you get in an urban environment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rural environment and that 's because of all the concrete and hard surfaces so we want to think about how we can make our garden resilient through green permeable soft surfaces which are also potentially very fire resistant if you choose the right plants they 're drought resilient because plants create their own kind of natural water cycle within your garden and of course we want to bring in diversity you don 't want all your eggs in one basket and just have a garden that 's completely full of lettuces or tomatoes we want diversity of of plants and species and insects and animals and birds because that 's where resilience comes from it comes from diversity so to explain urban heat island effect um as i mentioned those hard surfaces the concrete the bricks you think of a city environment if you go into melbourne cbd on a really hot day and you stay there you have dinner isn 't this nice after lockdown 's opening you can stay in melbourne and have dinner go to a show and you 'll come out at 11 o 'clock at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that heat is radiating off those black roads and all these hard surfaces so cities really trap heat it 's called a heat island and what you get out the further you get out from the city the more trees you have the more green space you have these areas cool down because there 's less of those hard surfaces that absorb the heat during the day and then release them at night and there 's more of the green stuff the trees the plants things that evapotranspirate and evapotranspirate is what evaporative cooling is based on it 's that gently releasing of the moisture into the air which has a cooling effect on the area around so the more green we can get around our houses the more resilient will be because the temperature will drop at night during heat waves so here is a infrared photo where you can see all those roads how red and dark and how much heat they 're absorbing so red is heat absorbed and the blue it almost looks black probably depending on your screen but the greeny blue color they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the same way if you are barefoot on a really hot day you can step on the lawn but you can 't step on the path beside it it will burn your foot so exactly that same concept but obviously on a much larger scale and then this is an infrared photo taken from street level where you can see the things that don 't absorb the heat or that cool down quickly and as you can see the trees there are particularly good at not absorbing the heat and it cooling down quickly excuse me and the road of course is very hot so this is just a diagram that explains that in a bit more detail but we will revisit this type of diagram when we also look at water the way that water moves through the environment also has a significant impact on those big rain events like we saw the other day as well as the heat absorption retention and cooling so what we call it when we create one of these small areas around our place that doesn 't hold the heat and cools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a garden or what you might have seen in a garden is on the south side of the house someone might have a furnace and you get moss growing in that furnace and and it 's a nice cool almost damp spot even on a hot day it feels really cool that 's a micro climate conversely on the north side of the house where you get direct sun you might have you know grass trees or a veggie patch or something that 's a lot more exposed but on a really hot day you 'll go out there and it 'll be hot so these are microclimates within our own yard those microclimates can become refuges so if it 's 40 or heaven forbid 45 degrees i can tell you that i would certainly be sitting in the fernery and not sitting in the veggie patch so it 's about creating these refuges but the beautiful thing of these refuges is to have a refuge from the heat we need green space we need plants and water plants do they grab carbon out of the atmosphere and store them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retain moisture so whilst your veggie patch on the north in full sun will dry out incredibly quickly and you 'll need to keep mulching it and watering it these refuges these microclimates that are very moist and shady they hold that moisture as the very nature of that small miniature ecosystem that you 've created that microclimate but what else they do is create biological stepping stones so as wildlife is deplo displaced or you know you think bats at bats are incredible pollinators probably more so than bees and you know butterflies and possums and lizards and all these animals that are constantly getting displaced from human activity um when we then get these wild weather events of extreme heat extreme rain extreme wind these little micro climates create biological stepping stones so animals can move and take cover retreat in one of these before they then move on to the next and move on to the next so they help connect bits of the environment as habitat as well as creating us special little refuges so what you want to do when you 're creating your micro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ functionality and fit for purpose um so you know you might want to put a path through there or a chair um or you know you might want to set up your barbecue in that area but you might find it gets mozzies and you want your bbq elsewhere so just think about in terms of of your design still make it fit for purpose because if you create a micro climate that 's then really unpleasant to sit in you 're not going to use it so you know you 're going to put in the effort to creating part of me creating a microclimate you want to enjoy it yourself it 's not just for wildlife it 's for you as well um utilize water if you can and permeable surfaces so perhaps rather than putting in a solid concrete path maybe put in some crazy pavers with um you know native creepers like native violet all growing in between rather than a solid concrete path for example but shade is definitely your friend and so you 're wanting to choose your really shady plants in in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cross breeze and natural cooling if the area is completely enclosed by brick walls and you 've then gone and put a pergola roof over the top you 're not going to get the cross breeze so you 're only going to get part of the benefit so think about air movement as well as your layout and the materials and surfaces that you choose and of course take advantage of vertical spaces like your fence you know whether you 're growing a vine up a fence or putting um you know one of those great vertical gardens on a fence or anything like that like use borrowed space use height and all that sort of thing i love grapevines for that that type of thing because grapevines are beautiful create a beautiful microclimate in summer um but of course drop their leaves in winter and give you a nice little sunny spot as well so really you want to create a little retreat uh so here 's just an example of you know very um straightforward low-cost uh little change on the left here you can see they 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grown a vine up there which actually looks like an edible vine to be honest so there 's ticking another box um growing something edible having that versus just an area out in the open where the only sort of bit of green space you 've got is that lemon tree i think it 's a lemon tree and you could just imagine how hot it would be on a 40 degree day sitting out at the table at the one on the right versus sitting on the chairs and the one on the left so the more green you have um it really helps not just with the air temperature but also the air quality if that air feels a bit moister and then as the breeze blows it 's going to feel a lot cooler so following on with that passive shading and cooling um a simple principle is just knowing obviously the sun rises in the east and sets in the west but in summer it 's really high in the sky above us and in winter it sits quite low so it 's sort of in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of goes around like that almost whereas in summer goes over the top so you can actually plan um your placement of shade whether that 's shade by pergola shade by plants to take advantage of the winter sun but block out the summer sun and that 's called passive shading and cooling and as i mentioned before with the grape vine you can see in the two pictures on the right here with um that would be a ah not jasmine i 've gone blank i 've got one sitting at the front door anyway i 'm sure you all know they know the vine that 's there they smell incredible wisteria wisteria um so something like wisteria where you get that beautiful shade in summer um but drops leaves in winter so you get the benefit and i love the picture above it i just love that you don 't have to go and use milled timber from a you know illegally logged rainforest you can use old stick there 's so much fallen timber at the moment after the big storms that i 'm i 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and logs and branches but i love that it 's been used in a pergola here so um you can get really creative you don 't have to go out to the local hardware store and buy questionable materials have a look around your garden have a look at the tip shop and see what you can use to actually create a shade structure and of course if you 've got no eaves or anything you can pop in a blind but better still can you pop in some sort of natural shading where you can grow plants um this the picture in the middle i really love because i 've seen this done with bed heads in fact i 've tried to do it with a bed head where you put bed head sort of as a fence and grow your vines up the bed head and that just gives you as the breeze goes through it it just gives you some more natural cooling and just looking at the picture on the left versus the middle and on the right do you feel like the one on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a lot of amazing research being done on the psychology of colors and that green the psychology of green is has a very cooling effect so it 's a bit of i guess a bit of a placebo as well and that mind over matter you feel cooler in a green space than you do surrounded by a brick wall um so again just you know even if you 're renting there are so many things that you can do to have you know these these shade structures and things so whether that 's um you know some of these are sort of more permanent there 's you can espalier if you don 't have much space espalier your fruit tree along a brick wall for example and that stops that wall absorbing too much heat because eventually obviously that tree would cover most of the wall and you can put put an old screen door in a in a tub on wheels that you can move around the house and if you 're renting take it with you to the next house so there 's so much that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adapting it to suit your house whether if you 're on a balcony for example like if you don 't have a garden you have a balcony um you know you could do something amazing on wheels with a screen that you could move around at different times of the year um it 's just a little example here i wouldn 't recommend using a flimsy clothing rack but just giving you that concept of having so you can make something that 's portable that still does the job or of course something permanent like using the vines um and and even just utilizing your fences with vines i would just recommend being the greenie in me says try not to use something weedy so i would avoid outdoors i would avoid things like english ivy and devil 's ivy um anything that 's going to actually damage bushland because birds will eat the berries and then put them elsewhere and it can be a real issue um so you know use something like grapes that aren 't weedy um and you can eat them like double benefit or maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um don 't need to to collect the food as well but yeah just have a think about what you can do up some of those vertical spaces just to i guess filter some of that direct sun and even indoors like this is just an example on the right of a um a lovely little benchtop plant arrangement that just helps filter that light as it cut in the sun as it comes through the window and it still has a cooling effect both physically and psychologically and just you can use all sorts of materials so this is just um wire and some timber struts and speaking of those using the green so using the vegetation as much as possible part of me is um obviously those green spaces between the pavers one they 're very cooling so there 's little refuges for lizards and ladybugs and all sorts of things it 's not just a stark open surface um it it has that localized it 's almost like a micro micro climate around each paver which helps keeps the pavers a bit cool obviously choosing a light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper is going to help on the left here still better than a solid path where you 've got the gravel and the pavers these are going to be particularly good too though when you get deluge because whilst they 're cooler than a solid surface because they hold moisture in them and because there 's vegetation they 're also going to drain better so when you do have deluge you 're going to have some water penetrate into the soil rather than just run off which is why we have so much flash flooding in urban environments because the water has to go somewhere and when it can 't sink into the ground it 'll head downhill and downhill as we often find is melbourne cbd so in terms of drought um that you know drought obviously is a lack of water which we 'll soon look at too much water in a minute um but what we really want to do is create soil that holds water create a micro incl micro climate that holds water and all that green space holds water really really well when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these natural fungi 's and microbes and all these things going on in the soil soil in itself is a living system that actually holds the moisture better than um you know just mulching alone or putting up a shade sale or something like that so anything you can do to improve your soil and to increase your plant cover um helps with moisture with moisture retention a lot of people think that oh well if i have a tree it 's going to suck up all the water isn 't that going to make droughts worse well no because what you 're doing when you 're putting in all this green space is you 're actually encouraging more water to stay within a cycle you 're creating that microclimate and that localized water cycle that 's otherwise lost from lack of vegetation um so of course you want to cover your soil um just check my next slide that i haven 't gone too far um you want to cover your soil so bare soil obviously as you can see on the right bare soil dries out very very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily damaged by the sun and by all the other elements whereas covered soil whether that 's covered in plants or covering mulch it 's self-sustaining so it holds the moisture in there a lot better and you want to think about your plant selection a lot of people want to build it or plant a drought proof garden by looking to you know arizona and saying okay well let 's just put in all cactuses um good and well yeah they 'll survive drought but what else do they offer like yes you can eat some of them but in terms of habitat they don 't offer much they don 't offer much cooling they don 't offer you a refuge they don 't offer you a microclimate so when you think about your plant selection maybe you look to the local environment and um or you know the local there 's so many beautiful bits of bushland um have a look along merbanong river and just see what nature designed that 's beautiful and self-sustaining and you might find some patches don 't really suffer at all during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you know thousands and thousands of years so look at your local plants look at your local indigenous plants and you know create some microclimates that are quite drought resistant just using native plants um but yeah definitely need to cover your soil that 's one of the keys another thing with drought too is we can potentially use a lot of water and and that 's not ideal my my perfect garden is a garden that you never have to water uh in fact i don 't i don 't have anywhere in the garden that i do any watering unless i 've just put in a new tree and the wrong time of year and i 'm giving it a bit of love um but you can think about in terms of water conservation um obviously if you 've got a veggie patch that 's not um like my veggies i grow in a fairly shady spot they don 't dry out but if you 've got a veggie patch in quite a hot spot cover your soil like keep the mulch with your your straw your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of water you need to give them and if you can capture some water on site to use that 's fantastic because a heck of a lot of energy goes into capturing processing and moving water through pipes around the city but you don 't want to catch capture so much water on site that you 're actually interrupting natural flows so um the environment needs a certain amount of water as well um local rivers you know you hear about it with the murray-darling basin all the time the rivers run dry because the farmers are using all the water so again it 's about finding that balance capture just what you need but not more than you need to keep the environmental flows happening and you want to minimize your evaporation so if you do have a water feature um or even just a bird bath think about your positioning of it so that it 's got some shade to minimize evaporation or putting in some native water plants like milfoil can prevent evaporation but you also want to prevent stagnancy because with climate change comes mosquito-borne diseases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't want to encourage mozzies although the bats love to eat them um so you know you want to make sure you 've got lots of backs in your garden before you breed lots of aussies so have that water moving have a little solar pump or something in there so that it 's not stagnant another good tip for conserving water is group your plants according to the water needs so i wouldn 't be having um you know spinach at one end of the garden and then tomatoes in the middle and then [Music] growing beetroots down the other end so that i 'm having to water way down there and in the middle and way down there and then have things that don 't need watering in between um because you 're you end up using a lot more water if you have them all in the one kind of broader area you 're only ever having to water that one broader area so group plants according to water needs don 't put drought tolerant plants with thirsty plants um and i can 't drive drum in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot then about wicking beds um so wicking beds instead of watering the top of your veggie patch a wicking bed is kind of like an above ground veggie patch where you 've got a pipe so you basically pour water into the pipe that you can see going vertically up the side the water goes into the gravel at the bottom and you don 't have to use gravel you could use wine corks for example and so it 's up to the plants to make the effort i sound like a mum make the effort to grow your roots really deep to use that water that 's deep in the soil that water therefore is nice and cool it 's not evaporating so it 's a really efficient use of water you don 't need much water in a wicking bed and so the sort of premise is that water wicks up through the soil because the plants use their roots to draw that water up through the soil and of course you don 't want to over water it because then you 'll water log the bottom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed but it 's one great way especially on smaller blocks or if you 're just not sure what your soil quality is and you want to grow some food you could start a wicking bed any raised garden bed you could do a wicking bed it 's really just about having a well-drained well-draining material such astoria or corks around a pipe and you 're just putting the water straight into the pipe rather than on the surface and i 'll show you rain gardens as well shortly um in terms of fire i know you know most people come along to these sessions and say oh but i live in the suburbs fire isn 't an issue um gosh i remember back to my teenage years when most of canberra caught fire um mostly because of the wooden paling fences like piling fences are one of the biggest fire threats because they 're not living so a living vegetation is a lot less fire prone than dead vegetation such as a timber fence so there is a lot you can do to protect yourself against ember attack so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you did get fire even um thinking back to black saturday like people were still getting embers um you know in like maribyrnong area amber 's will travel that far so um by planting a fire break particularly if you were you know perhaps you back on to a bushland reserve by planting the right species between your house and the reserve you can actually really protect your house and your vegetation from fire um i won 't go to it in great detail today because it 's it 's a whole other topic but um i 've got a plant here during questions i 'll go and grab a sprig of it called boob yellow which is a native coastal plant very very fire resistant and i 've got a hedge of it right where my firefront would come through if we had a fire through so what happens if you plant some of these low fire species and then most of them are local species a lot of wattles are very fire resistant if there are embers coming in from a fire uh in the greater melbourne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out rather than continue on and you know roll into fine fuels right up at your windows and and take off so um but the main thing is the more vegetation you can keep in the ground you 're keeping a high moisture content so it 's called um fine moisture content or fuel moisture content you want a moist environment so you don 't want to be regularly burning your garden or a bushland reserve or anything else you want water moisture to build up through mulches and through plants and that type of thing and that gives you the greatest resilience for fires coming through if you 've planted the right plants um so and because you hear you don 't hear about um garden bed fires you hear about grass fires because grass dries out very very quickly whereas a garden bed full of lush plants and mulch doesn 't dry out very quickly so when a fire gets to a nice moist environment it 'll tend to smolder and can be pulled up whereas in dry grass it 'll just keep going so there 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you but down the bottom the link here that apsvic.org.iu fire resistant plants if you do back onto a bushland reserve or um or it 's just something that particularly interests you you can have a look at a lot of the local indigenous plant species that can give you some some quite good protection against ember attack um and just a disclaimer on that i 'm not saying that a particular plant can stop a bushfire in its tracks um it 's about making your garden resilient to ember attacks so being able to catch embers rather than just catch a light okay so deluge hopefully we 're not going to go over time no we 're looking pretty good um so with deluge what we 're finding and what we 've certainly witnessed in the last couple of weeks is we might get less rain but when it does come oh gee a lot comes at once so it 's about creating a garden that can handle a lot of deluge and not just have it all run off so the more concrete and hard surfaces we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overloaded far too quickly so having permeable surfaces even if it 's just a lawn everything like that helps what happens though with these deluge events is everything washes off the surface so we want really like a really rich soil environment where we 've got really good fungal activity in the soil and really good roots plant roots because that holds it all together and it stops you just losing all your topsoil uh and all your seed banks and everything else uh and as we 've seen through the storms in the last couple of weeks a tree loss the number of trees that have just tipped over straight out of the ground because the soil becomes just so saturated the trees just lose stability um there 's you know there 's only so much we can do about that because we we do need the water to absorb into the soil there 's nowhere else for it to go other than to clog up stormwater systems and flood creeks it 's it 's going to happen but there might be some things that you can do around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plants to you know develop as strong roots as they can um just to perhaps minimize how many um just fall over through that environment i 've got um a tree that i 've noticed that was on a bit of an angle and i thought oh that 's a bit strange i 'm sure that tree 's changed shape and so i 've gone up and you know to have a feel and it 's so loose in the ground and it 's because it 's in we 're on sandy soil here and it 's in a fairly sandy patch of soil with just kind of a bit of scattered grass around it because i 've just not had time to get mulch delivered and i know if i 'd had mulch delivered and then got my other plants in and got roots in that would have one used up some of that water but just giving that tree a bit of chance so that tree is going to fall now so think about again creating that microclimate in your soil to give give you sort of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improve infiltration um we also well i suppose one of the issues with a lot of the trees falling over is the water 's going very quickly just into the surface where the roots are and not going beyond uh and that 's because soil becomes very compacted that 's a whole other topic as well but thinking on a local level how can you improve water just seeping into the soil rather than running off and one of the ways you can do that is by increasing ponding i 'll show you a picture in just a tick increasingly permeable surfaces so again a gravel driveway is obviously going to be more effective at that than a concrete or bitumen driveway and you know you might do a bit of harvesting and retention so that during those deluge events that 's when you capture your water and during drought you um open up your down pipe again so that that water 's flowing into the environment so in terms of increasing ponding as you as you know um with water um gravity it follows gravity goes downhill so um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local creek um but things that you can do on site might be something like building a dry creek bed so you can see here very slight slope of land not not even steep but by digging out that little culvert and putting in some gravel that then captures the water so instead of just running really fast off across the lawn onto the road flooding the local area it 's capturing in that dry creek bed which certain times of the year won 't be dry and that then gives it a chance to seep not only into the soil but deeper into the soil not just at the soil surface so just again think of some ways that you can perhaps encourage water flow to slow down so that it 's not racing across the ground and um yeah slowing it down to how it would in nature because in nature you 'll have wallabies scratching and all sorts of things so you 'll have all lots of divots and culverts and trees down and logs down all these things that just capture and slow everything and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 've really interrupted those natural flows um so i can 't stress enough about the permeable surfaces that really helps it 's called wussed water sensitive urban design so it 's just about planning that long-term stormwater resilience looking at the flow and how we can slow the flow so one way again very similar to a wicking bed is a rain garden so rather than you watering it you stick it under your down pipe so it 's it just gets flooded when there 's deluge but you plant plants that can handle being flooded but you don 't have to water the rest of the year and the concept of this one is that water then seeps down through the bottom and then behaves a bit like a wicking bed so these are rain gardens on the side of the road where when you do have deluge um these are obviously you can see just from there the gutter on the the right hand side there there 's spots that would normally have flooded uh and lawn doesn 't absorb water nearly as quickly as a rain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here they do have an overflow pipe so if the water level gets above a certain level it will flow into the pipe but it just really prevents a lot of flooding you see a lot of these around libraries um and car parks and things like that and again it 's just to direction and slow that flow like that culvert we just saw so in terms of a productive garden um we want to look at biomimicry so just following natural systems um as i 've mentioned with the culverts and branches down everything else what did nature have in plan before we came along and disrupted it what can we restore you know um how did food grow before we came and industrialized the food system can we use um you know sustainable materials and things like that that um you know don 't have such a big environmental impact so it 's about thinking about the materials that you use as well as the garden long term um how much you can mimic nature and the best way to mimic nature is just to look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a canopy so you have something over the top that causes shade you have various layers in the middle and you have a ground layer so rather than having trees on a lawn think about having those understory species and all those things that give you that better better resilience against the heat waves against the flood that give the soil better drainage because the soil is in better condition so just following nature 's design and thinking what does it look like out in the bush or how can we replicate some of those concepts it doesn 't have to look like the bush it 's about taking those concepts and applying them to a formal garden design um so some of the things that we look at when we 're designing a garden to be productive is again we 're looking at microclimates and things but maybe on the on the hotter side that side of the garden where it does get the sun um taking advantage of that for growing your fruit trees and all that type of thing so you might be creating a microclimate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wool in fact i think citrus trees are fairly fire resilient as well so um you 're kind of ticking a lot of different boxes and you get food with it so um another really important one is seed saving something that happens in nature as you would know is plants go to flower and fruit and seed and those seeds drop where the plant is if an animal doesn 't eat them and then they regrow and so every generation those seeds are better and better adapted to that local environment that works for food plants as well so tomatoes i 'm sure many people here have captured or saved tomato seeds from the previous season and planted them the next season by the third or fourth season you have the best bumper tomatoes ever because each season they adapt and so it 's about taking those principles of nature and applying them for a productive garden so definitely saving your seeds is really important for that respect um but also choosing plants that you will eat like if you 're growing food plants don 't just plant something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's not something you eat then you might as well plant a habitat plant so um so make sure it 's useful for you um as well and just in terms of aspect again just to reiterate for those that maybe anna 's experience with gardening is on the north you tend to get the hotter sun on the south it tends to be sheltered from the sun in fact sometimes on the south you 'll never see the sun but get a feel for when you get your late summer breezes versus your very drying winds versus your icy frosty winter winds and just take all of that into consideration when you 're planning what fruit trees to put where what veggies to put where where to build refuges where to maybe plant out a bit of a wall a bit of a wind break um consider all those things and every block 's different because you 've got lots of different local influences you might be next to a two-story house that blocks those horrible cold winds so yeah get to know your block and take into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ north and south in terms of your plant selection i like to make sure that my plants tick three boxes so when i 'm choosing a plant for the garden i ask what habitat value does it have um am i gonna go and plant a hat a cactus because it 's climate resilient um but it doesn 't offer any habitat value for local honey eaters or the local koalas or anything else um so what habitat value does it have is it something i can eat as well great with bush tucker i tick both those boxes with bush tucker but often um just regular regular plants like um i 've got lots of daisies and things out there that help support the pollinators and little lizards living amongst that so there 's habitat value and they work well with food value because they support the pollinators that then pollinate the food um and of course they 're quite climate resilient so um there they 're sort of my three criteria when i 'm looking at a plant and so i think you know does it just tick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three or does it tick more than one because ones that tick multiple ones especially in a small garden obviously it 's good bang for buck i think about the water needs too so i tend not to plant a really thirsty tree um i would sooner plant say a eucalypt than a plain tree or an ochre and elm tree because oaks and elms and plane trees they don 't offer anything for habitat they offer lots for allergies they don 't offer anything for food and they don 't offer anything for climate resilience so they don 't take any boxes whereas the eucalypt um offers climate resilience and habitat value and to a certain point food value if you really wanted to capture the nectar so at least it ticks two of the boxes so when you 're choosing a plant you can actually weigh them up and go okay well i 've got these two plants this one doesn 't take any boxes this one takes one or this one takes two uh i 'll choose this one so and then my other consideration is how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i don 't want things to spread into bushland and do damage so i think about things like little blue reins and um you know obviously where i am there 's koalas but owls and possums and gliders and bats and all sorts of things but then on top of that i think about things like climate refuge um palms and things are really nice when it 's really hot it 's just i don 't know maybe it 's psychological that it 's tropical but banana palms gee they take a lot of boxes because they grow bananas and they give you the palm you feel um and they 're quite climate resilient so um you know have you think about some of the different food plants and um if you really splitting hairs over which food plant to plant you might find that one 's more climate resilient or one offers more habitat than another and that 'll help you choose of course i think about heat and frost as well frost probably getting less and less over the years but with climate change we may at times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currents are shifting and it 'll suddenly bring in a jet stream that we wouldn 't have normally had because of the disruption so climate change doesn 't just mean hotter all the time everywhere um it it really is about the destabilization um i think too about whether or not it 's deciduous i would never plant something deciduous where the leaves are going to drop into a natural waterway or storm water drain because that nutrient load then kills all the macroinvertebrates that then the platypuses speed on um but really close to the house is a great spot because it 's um giving you nice and nice shady area during summer and um protection oh sorry during summer and sun during winter um so yeah i 've pretty much sort of covered all all of these um sort of areas of cultivation i just keep coming back to bananas because it blows my mind i drive around the suburbs of melbourne and see these incredible banana crops i think how do how does this happen in such a temperate environment and as time goes on with climate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bananas grow so well down here um so think about having a productive edible garden you might be able to tick both boxes in the one garden um and create your micro climate or refuge in your food garden um and yeah definitely thinking about diversity of course there 's reduced emissions of production because you 're growing something yourself you 're not using all the petrochemical uh resources on it you 're getting better food security you 're more resilient things like bananas don 't really burn so there 's always amazing factors when you 're starting to look at cultivating your garden and then two other factors that i haven 't covered in today 's session but you definitely need to consider is whether or not you maybe want to keep chooks for food security and if so where are you going to put them because they become very heat stressed but they need sun so again you need to think through all these micro climate things in terms of positioning your chooks and of course composting is really about supporting your soil and reducing your emissions so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because about half of what we throw to landfill melbourne as a population is stuff that could have been composted that creates a lot of methane which then accelerates climate change so it 's about you know mitigating climate change as well as improving our soil and of course it 's such an amazing catalyst for gardening because it um you know once you 're composting and you get that first tomato pop up uh suddenly you know suddenly you become a tomato grower where you never were going to be before so um so with that said i 'm going to unshare so that we can take your questions and um yes i appreciate it it 's a lot to cover in um in one hour so it 's all very high level but it 's about taking those concepts and applying them in your situation but um we do have we we have five or six minutes so hopefully we can answer questions in a bit of detail and um any that we don 't have time for i 'm happy to sort of send through answers later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much helpful and detailed information um yeah which i hope was inspiring for everyone um so let 's see if fiona needs to go now thanks for joining us fiona um if anyone has any other questions please type them in the chat now um ella i actually had a couple of questions that popped in to find during your presentation um so you mentioned about wooden fencing um being a possible fire risk are there any alternatives that you would recommend um in a perfect world we wouldn 't even have fences because wildlife movement but we have cats and dogs and things like that so um you know why offences are probably probably a lower impact option um yeah in terms of fire i mean even wire fences can still capture a lot of debris so there 's not a great deal of choice um metal and brick fences use a lot of resources so yeah it 's sort of it 's just kind of one of those necessary evils unless we 're gonna get really savvy with cyclone fences all around our properties got it but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are very quick to blame bushland without actually thinking of the bigger picture i think if our if our bushland is um really moist and how nature designed it to be it 's actually fairly resilient so um to a point like with climate change obviously that 's a whole nother spanner in the works that 's suddenly drying out areas that should have never dried out before but um yeah it 's just it 's just an interesting point if there is a fire and if you 're in greater melbourne and there is a fire in greater melbourne and you 're getting ember attack on your house you don 't have to just think about your gutters and everything else there 's so many things that that you need to consider so yeah yeah thanks that um catherine has a question my backyard is a lawn that slopes down to a garden bed would you recommend a rain garden between the lawn and the garden bed yeah yeah 100 that 's an awesome spot for a rain garden so um and you can do just like a dry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culvert um you might want to put in some hard edging just to make it easier to stop your lawn growing down into the culvert um unless you don 't mind a really messy garden like there 's no no huge issue if you have a culvert that 's just chock full of grass and stuff like as far as nature 's concerned she 's happy with that um but depending on where you live that could be a snake risk and so forth so um yeah putting in a hard edge can can just help to control that and keep it nice and neat we like neat gardens don 't we how wide should it be and how deep uh how long 's a piece of string depends on the size of your garden so i would if i was having a culvert between garden between a lawn and a garden bed you see like i about probably 80 centimeters like it it doesn 't have to be massive but if it 's you know 20 centimeters or 30 centimeters it 's not really enough so um you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right so you want it to be visually appealing as well and not look really jarring by being really narrow you can have it really deep really wide too and i 'd probably have it half as deep as it is wide so say it 's 80 centimeters wide be like 40 centimeters deep thank you that sounds great thank you i have a fair bit of lawn before the garden bed so i think i could go a bit bigger go bigger yeah yeah exactly like i could put one here that 's um like we 're on a slope here and um yeah i 've got some that i 'm gonna that i 've got planned that are gonna be small but i 've got one patch that i 'm thinking of putting in like a five meter culvert so you know i get it depends on your block ella and marie has a question i 'm looking at putting in a few raised garden beds to grow veggies would you recommend a wicking system i assume there 's a bit of additional cost to set it up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your climate resilience the cost doesn 't have to be much more if you go to sort of a tip shop or a second hand like a junkyard shop because you really just need some poly pipe you could even use um my parents call it aggie aggie pipes are the black with the slots in it it 's sort of like like a bit of a tube um you just want something that you can get the water down into the bottom area and again you don 't have to buy gravel but you 'll pick gravel up pretty much free off um you know facebook marketplace or something like that um wine cooks are really easy to come by because we 're the only people that collect them for recycling now and we 're mostly using them in trials for different gardening applications so you 'll easily get wine corks um but you need to weigh them down because they will float if they get wet uh and then just some like some fabric whether you want to use some jute or um like a geo fabric a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stop your soil running down into your well draining area so you can do that for next to nothing if you shop around and get second hand but failing that just make sure you use a lot of sort of pee straw or sugar cane mulch or something like that and a lot of compost so make sure your your soil is really really rich in organic material and really well mulch that 's kind of yeah you 're back up which can be just as expensive as a wicking bed um because from a biosecurity perspective you you know you want to make sure you 're getting your soil and your compost and your pesto and everything from a reputable source so that you 're not introducing diseases and and other things to your garden so it 's a bit of a catch 22. yeah awesome um and one final question perhaps um what are you planting in your veggie patch right now that maybe some other people can get inspired by i have a four-year-old that is cucumber obsessed so it is cucumbers cucumbers cucumbers if i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me um yeah so at the moment we 're just planting cucumbers strawberries and lettuce because she 's the world 's fussiest eater so and if she 's involved then she will hopefully eat it so yeah again plant what your family will eat there 's no point growing pumpkins if no one eats pumpkins um but this time of year so we 're coming it 's been a very cold late wet spring it 's going to be a fairly cool summer so it 's going to be a good summer for your leafy greens probably not going to be quite as good of summer for fruiting things um fruiting things need a lot of sun but yeah so i will end up supplementing with a lot of leafy greens for my sake yeah oh and cherry tomatoes too because of the grape the grape shaped cherry tomatoes we do a lot of hair loom hair loom heirloom um plants from from various sources because it 's just so much fun with all the colors awesome lots of inspiration all right well thank you so much ella that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same thing thank you for the great presentation um yeah really appreciate your time and sharing of knowledge today for this global learning festival event so thanks everyone for joining we hope that you enjoyed it"

    "text": "[Music] well good morning friends and welcome to story time at home with marin venom libraries look at me i 'm outside i decided to come outside and read some stories to you today because it 's such a gorgeous gorgeous day today and we 're out of lockdown melbourne so it 's so wonderful so i 'm just going to sit out here in my backyard and enjoy the sun and read three lovely stories to you today our first story is called a walk in the park and it 's by anthony brown one morning mr smith and his little girl smudge took their dog albert for a walk on that same morning mrs smythe and her son charles were taking their dog victoria for a walk that smudge mr smith and albert went into the park mrs smythe charles and victoria arrived soon after albert was impatient to be let off his lead victoria waited quietly until mrs smythe had detached the lead from her collar two very different dogs aren 't they both dogs were free they chased each other all over the park mr smith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smudge sat with him mrs smythe sat at the other end with charles smudge and charles looked at each other albert and victoria raced along the paths dodging round trees leaping over flower beds first albert chased victoria and then victoria chased albert and then albert chased victoria again so quickly that sometimes it was difficult to tell them apart look at them go while the dogs played smudge and charles edged nearer and nearer to each other look at them mr smith and mrs myers looked the other way smudge went on the swings swinging higher and higher as high as she did charles was not so sure meanwhile an angry gardener chased the dogs off the flower beds look at them they took off their coats and smudged swung like a monkey on the climbing frame oh that looks like fun albert felt too hot so to cool himself he plunged into the fountain smudge and charles climbed a tree they all played on the bandstand the whole world seemed happy but mr smith read his newspaper at one end of the bench and mrs smythe looked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picked a flower and gave it to smudge albert a smudge yelled mr smith time for om come here victoria come along charles called mr smythe time for lunch mrs smythe took charles and victoria home mr smith took home smudge and albert very different homes aren 't they and smudge kept the flower the end well there 's lots in that book isn 't there lots of differences but the two people the two little people made friends instantly and the dogs all right our second story is amazing story maisie goes to the show shall we read it together let 's go today maisie and her friends are going to the theatre the show is called funny feathers and the star is flora fantastica oh look that looks so great doesn 't it are you going to go

at them they play all night long sometimes a tasmanian devil joey will ride on its mum 's back that looks like a fun ride doesn 't it some baby animals are called hatchlings oh look at these brave crocodile hatchlings i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swim hang on crocodile mum gently carries their hatchlings to the water in her mouth goodness gracious me oh wriggly python hatchlings look at them they slither away looking for a meal python mum coils around their eggs to keep them warm until they hatch look at them they 're starting to come out of their eggs there this baby animal is called a fry what kind of animal is that it 's a sea dragon they drift away from their dad dads have babies sea dragon dads carry the fry eggs on their tails until they hatch these australian baby animals are called chicks fluffy emu chicks look at them dart in and out of their dad 's tall legs the emu dad sits on the eggs and looks after the chicks after they hatch noisy cockatoo chicks look at them feed

scaling um for those of you who don 't know me my name is kay i did write a book called how to start a side hustle and unintentionally i promise you i accidentally dressed as my cup the cover of my book tonight um which is pretty funny but i um i wrote how to start the side hustle i was just telling um the team here i uh and in 2020 actually and and launched it in july 2021 so this year um and it 's so nice to be able to share this content with you guys and i was kind of getting a bit emotional because as we 're coming out of lockdown and we 're still a little bit online um feeling yeah that i haven 't been able to be in my favorite places which is libraries and bookshops and in-person events to share the book so it 's uh so lovely to be able to still connect with you guys no matter that we 're still online i 've got some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i reckon we can smash out as much of the book as possible um you can get it at the library or you can also buy it through the website or online and bookshops i highly recommend getting in and supporting and but uh we 're gonna we 're gonna run through the chapters and the idea of this book for me and for the publisher hardy grant was that you could pick this book up and you could start from the beginning come up with an idea or refine your idea and have a very step-by-step process on how to get that idea off the ground in the most practical straight out way and that is how i like to learn and how i like to business coach i run a podcast i do workshops and events and i have done for seven years so it 's kind of a condensed version of the last seven years of my life for twenty dollars um and yeah that you can walk away at the end of this book and um and feel capable and have an understanding of business so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worker for many years and then went on to advise government in queensland about best practice for youth services i worked with kids at risk in indigenous communities and school system and my job was program development and coming up you know concepting ideas and and teaching them in relatable ways and i was ended up climbing the ladder into the corporate world and doing all the things that i thought i was meant to be doing quickly found out that it wasn 't for me and i was on a slippery slope to burn out and had a bit of a health scare took myself to the doctor the doctor took me for a brain scan the brain scan came back clean but i had this 24 hours of of going what if something was going wrong what would i do differently with my life and realize that this idea of god going to a nine to five and and hustling for something that wasn 't making me happy and that i didn 't feel creative in um wasn 't the way that i wanted to be living my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and researching and and entrepreneurship and startup kept coming up and this was 2014 and it just lit me up and i was like this is me no one ever told me i could have been an entrepreneur and it just made so much sense and the way that they were describing entrepreneurs were these people who you know had 30 jobs before they were 30 or they were tech savvy or um creatives and coming up with solutions and for me i was like this is how i want to be working i don 't want to be stuck in a in a nine to five that that i can 't express what i want to be doing in my career and so i started researching and and seeking to understand and getting coaches and mentors and putting myself in that environment and came up with the idea of startup creative which is at what we call the go-to source for straight-up business advice and i 've over the last seven years i 've printed five magazines i 've written a book i have a podcast coach thousands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all around the world and so it 's so for me i came into this without a mba or you know much business experience but i knew that i i wanted to design my dream life and my dream career and that when i was in that funk uh there was no one coming to save me so i had to be the one to do something about it and so i went on the journey of figuring it out and teaching people along the way and breaking down what when i started was a very uh male men in suits tech startup corporatey uh feel to it and have had many ups and downs along the way from people telling me my idea wouldn 't work and that my name wasn 't good enough and i wasn 't the right person to be running the business so persevering through all of that and believing that there was a a need for people who were creative and not necessarily business-minded but had beautiful ideas and things to bring to the world and i wanted to help them make that happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a book version as well um so thank you for being here we 've got lillian who wants to start a side hustle

yeah i 'm here to help so whatever it is that comes up any questions specifics let me know and i 'll do my best to give that as much info @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and just keep my chat box open so i can keep an eye over here on where we 're at okay let 's do this how to start a side hustle okay chat box is up let 's go oops what is going on here okay so the very beginning of this book i think i probably spent about a month um researching and trying to write and the book for me the the first chapter for me really needed to set the pace of why i think now is the right time to start a side hustle and i think it 's even more so i wrote it as code was hitting to be honest um but even more so i 've seen a huge increase in my business of people losing their jobs or working from home or quitting their jobs um because of the change of environments in the world that we 're living in and the the research that i was really passionate about and wanted to portray was that we had this um you know this change in our in how society ran and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other and and finding our tools and our trade and what we 're passionate about and prioritizing community to going into the industrial revolution where factories were able to make things cheaper and faster and export them and create demand so a lot of craftsman creators especially came out of villages and went to work in uh in the um in the factories and we had to do mundane tasks repetitively day in day out and that 's where we learned to clock in and clock out and and to do the nine to five um but some really amazing research that i found was that it actually years and years later have they 've been able to see where it started declining our health by not having the autonomy over our lives by not having creativity not being able to prioritize our personal health and well-being in our community and our family and i think for me the the biggest thing that really drew me to wanting to start a business was that it is so accessible and even more so from when i started the social media apps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ digital things that we can do that means that we can get up we can register an abn and australian business number and and get out there and start trading across the globe in a few clicks which is pretty amazing of course it 's not that easy and it doesn 't guarantee success but that 's what we 're going to talk about tonight but for me it 's been this opportunity to be like question the norm to question the trajectory of of the life that we have always told that we should do which is to go to school to go to university get a job pay the mortgage do you know do what needs to be done and that 's the life that i was my parents have have lived and that i thought that i i should also be living so to be able to to question and go what if i was able to do what i love and get paid for it and when i started asking that question and and it started working for me i was able to then teach other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really do believe that when we have this passion or this creativity whether you want to make it your full-time hustle or not um having it as a side hustle is a really viable way to get a business off the ground and when i started there was a lot of people who said you know one in three businesses are going to fail in the first six to 12 months and startups can 't afford to get support and all these things and i really do believe that 's because we there 's this like there 's this way that we can have a side hustle that makes it a safe and affordable way to test an idea which is a really vital part of the starting a business process and we 'll get into that a little bit later um but just for the deaf finish and the side hustle is something that you do on the side of your main hustle so you might have your main income and then a side hustle is a little like side project that we can test out and whilst it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy and your resources to get a side hustle off the ground it 's actually a really good way to see whether you like doing the business whether there 's a need and a demand and a customer that likes what you have to offer and then also whether um it 's going to be viable so whether there 's going to be enough profit in there as well um all right i 've got some questions here how do you stand out amongst others we 'll jump into that for sure so many businesses um if the things you want to yeah so just quickly i will jump on that so how do you stand out against others we 're going to talk about your minimal viable product and coming up with something that you can take to market and then defining your point of difference as well which is the way that you stand out the trick here is really when we speak to the target market i think it 's really getting clear on exactly what it is that you want to do for somebody else and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find your little pocket you don 't have to try and sell to everyone and do everything for everyone and you know the diversity and also something that i 'm really noticing is as consumers we 're getting more and more specific about the values that a brand holds as well so if a brand is you know sustainable or locally made or you know fast turnaround whatever that value is um people are really honing in on niches of deep down what a brand stands for which actually provides more opportunity for different brands um to pop up and to do things differently okay this is the from the a quote from the book um a 2018 study conducted by harvest harvard business review concluded that being forced to leave autonomous self-created lives to work mundane jobs under constant supervision for minimal wages led to a clear decline in the physical and mental wellbeing of the population okay let 's come up with this perfect business idea which will also answer the question about how you stand out so first of all when you 're coming up with your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i 'm passionate about this is like what do you love to do and you definitely there 's so many different business ideas out there and so many different business models and offerings that you can that you can offer um and i i have business ideas all the time but the ones that actually and i see this in my coaching clients time and time again the people who stick at ideas and push through when it gets hard and keep moving towards the end goal to get it off the ground because it is going to be really hard work especially on certain days and we 've seen that through covert um if you love what you do and you 're good at it and you are passionate about it and it lights you up then chances are you 're going to get up and keep going and going and going when the going gets tough and a lot of people will give up you know and so when you 're coming up with that idea if you can start with and in the book you 'll find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of these questions so looking at to there 's a whole activities um section that you 'll see in the book about what do you love to do if you could design your dream job and start there and you don 't necessarily have to be like that 's your exact business idea um but it 's a good place to start in terms of just brainstorming from a really big picture perspective you don 't need to always be like cool i 'm going to do this sometimes that comes out but i work with many people and i have lots of conversations of people like i could do this what about that i 've got so many ideas i don 't know where to start start with getting them all out of your head and what really lights you up because that 's going to give you a superhuman power when it gets really tough right and there 's going to be days when you want to give up even as somebody who 's been in business for seven years and um loves what i do and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've had there 's still plenty of hard days that make you want to give up but if you believe in it enough and you want it then you will um it comes from a deep sense of purpose and passion and you know you 'll you 'll hear a lot of people talking about why why like what is your why for me this is where this is the questions what do you love to do what are you good at um another good one if you 're looking for an idea and you you know i often get coaching clients who come and say i just want to work for myself i 've always wanted to work for myself another good place to start is to say what are you naturally good at what if maybe people said hey can you help me with this or you know i really love the way you do that or can i buy that artwork off you um is another good way to start seeing what a potential business model could be for you feel free to jump in with questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we 're kind of starting to map it out what you want to understand is that a business is a exchange of value for money so your job is to come up with a value whether it 's a solution that you can offer or a value add to somebody 's life and who is willing and able to exchange money for that so the person who is willing and able is what we call your target market your target market should be the most important thing that you focus on in your business at this when you 're starting a side hustle because so many people come in like this is what i 'm gonna do and i 'm gonna start this business and it 's gonna be great and here 's all the bells and whistles and i 'd say well who 's your target market and who 's gonna buy it and and are they willing and able to buy it and if you don 't have a customer then you just have a brilliant idea or you have a nice hobby right something that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of business owners can go wrong as they come in with their idea and whilst you might want what you have to offer you also need to make sure that there 's more than just you or your friends and family who want it in order for it to be viable and sustainable and to be able to make profit and keep growing so putting your customer at the center is going to be key to having success in your business and i still do this day in day out of really seeking to understand and you know you can do that through surveys through conversations through posting and facebook groups to pulling a group of friends together to asking around um and it 's also okay to assume from the beginning so again um in the book there 's a whole bunch of worksheets in here i should have tagged the book um that 'll give you a bunch of questions in here about understanding who your target market is so that you can ensure that they actually want what you have to offer so once you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do i love to do what could that look like as a business you know maybe i 'll sell my art or i 'm really good at graphic design or i want to teach people okay what am i good at teaching um you kind of come up with a rough idea we 're not even jumping into starting the business yet we 're now just going to go and find if there 's people who are willing and able to buy from you what you have to offer so your job is to go as deep as you possibly can into understanding your audience as per page 29 and um there 's some questions in here which i 'll read some for you now so what is the problem or the need that you have identified for them who do you think needs this solution what beliefs or do they have around this problem or the value that they 're looking for and you want to go into as much detail as possible not only is this going to help you to go okay this is who i think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colors you use what tone of voice you use how much you think they would be able to afford or that they would be willing to pay where are they currently getting it and why is yours different why would they choose you over where they 're currently getting it or what don 't they like about where they 're currently getting it um and how will you make their life better the biggest thing if you can and not all businesses a lot of businesses add value so you know clothing and jewelry and things like that um art again um music but a lot of businesses will solve a problem for people so they will you know for me as a business coach is giving straight up business advice so what is the the solution that you 're offering what is the thing that you can go to them and say hey this is what i 've got and that you can get that response that says this is exactly what i 've been looking for this is exactly how i want to get my business advice this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for my logo whatever it might be yeah so try and really carve out what it is that you 're going to do differently so business in exchange for value for money what problem are you solving or how will you make their life better and really spend a lot of time here if you you can use the worksheet to kind of like um assume at the beginning but then you kind of you want to validate it so you want to start to find people and we 'll jump into that next um but really start asking questions and a lot of people get scared to to say you know this is my business idea what do you think but it 's actually that 's just our ego and we get a bit scared to put ourselves out there but that 's really vital information because without that real data you might just have an idea in your head that maybe isn 't going to translate in the real world and so you can start asking those questions or accessing the people that you think that um would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to not like just go to friends and family because often they 'll give you a bit of a biased opinion and you want to access people and and say look would you buy this and they 're like yeah i would better spend this much or um nah i 've already got a really great brand i think what do you love about that brand so it 's all really important information and feedback and try not to take it too personally um at the beginning and then we need to get in the game so we 've done our we 've come up with our idea we got some ideas of we think that there 's enough people who would want what we have and this is where it starts to get a little bit tricky this is where the fear and the self-doubt really starts to kick in and people you know just want to ask that question should i quit my day job or you know um yeah i just want to do this all the time often this is where the momentum starts to build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and um this is where before you go in too deep and start spending all your money on a 20 000 website or ordering a hundred thousand stock from from your suppliers excuse me um then you want to actually do one very important step which is to decide uh get one paying customer that is not your mum and get somebody who is going they might not exchange full dollar from the beginning but they 're willing to exchange something in for what you have okay and that is going to do wonders because a it 's what they call validating an idea um but then you can also get real life feedback as to how you went and whether it would your product worked or whether your services was you know smooth and flowing or or you were good at what you did thought you were able to do whether you liked it whether they liked it um in this when i remember being in this space and i think my first ever business coaching session i did was like 50 i did a 90-minute session i sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i didn 't have an office um i did about three hours either side of the session so probably end up paying myself like you know five dollars an hour for the amount of effort that i went into it um and then you know over the years as i was able to build my reputation build my outcomes build my skill set and my knowledge i was able to increase my prices but i didn 't come in with that from the beginning um so we had another question in there yeah christie 's over there um so you want to get in and it 's just get that minimal viable product what is the quickest way you can get something to a customer and get as much possible feedback uh and then you just need to jump in take the leap and this is my favorite quote a year from now you 'll wish you started today um and for me i think that that 's where so many people get stuck sometimes planning the back end the branding the logo the idea talking about it is easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of time there and jumping in and actually going and asking someone to buy what you have is really scary but it 's scary because most of the time we 've never done it before or it 's something that we love and we 're scared of that rejection renee brown talks a lot about that fear of shame is one of the scariest things that humans will ever experience that keep us small and keep us from taking action and it 's stepping into into it and getting in the game and i had this with a client recently um i reckon i supported them for about a year coming up with the idea and we we spun around about three different ideas finally we got in uh you know started putting it all together the website the branding the nice things and then actually launching and getting in it was so scary it was kind of like off you go time you 're ready um and the lessons that have been learnt along the way from um you know that we could not have possibly answered or predicted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were in the game um so getting those uh getting in there you will learn so much from just starting and being able to be okay in the fear and the unknown and this the the overwhelm of it all and you can do things like support get business coaches or join support groups or mentors or you know communities to help you in that space because it 's unfamiliar territory if you 've only ever worked in nine to five and you haven 't started a side hustle before it 's going to feel uncertain and the more that you can sit in that and just learn and support yourself um it 's going to be invaluable to it cool i have to plan my product service to be free to the consumer do i make profit through brand partnerships so i i plan to have my product service to be free to the consumer do i make profit through brand partnerships yes i 'm guessing so jasmine um my question my my response to that would be somebody 's going to pay for it i 'm guessing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investment um partnerships for sure it 'd be i 'd be interested to hear if you want to put it in the chat and felt okay with it um jasmine if you want to go deeper into that and i can give some more context based on what that might look like okay so once we 've we 've got our idea we think we know someone who 's going to buy it we 've tested it out we 've got some sales the next step is then we can start really packaging it up and investing in it a lot of people want to go straight to this place because it 's the fun part um but you need to test and validate your idea first and foremost then we can start to go into putting your packaging together putting your brand together so your branding is like your way to communicate to the to your audience to to present yourself and say this is who i am and this is what i stand for it 's kind of a hidden language in a sense that a secret language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us will identify certain brands and a really good example is um i love coffee and i especially love specialty coffee um so if i 'm ever in a new city or or town you kind of look out for the place that you know there 's a certain type of coffee shop where you 're like i think they would do a filter or a pour over or um you know something specialty or a nice black um and you can kind of tell you know when you walk past the shop were you like is that for me or not that 's what branding is doing that is that it 's telling you whether you relate to them or you think you 'd like them or whether they 're your kind of business or brand right um so your branding is that so when we go back to that target market it 's really going what does my customer believe in what other brands do they love and trust you know what um what colors do they wear you know how do they talk where are they spending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to create a brand that 's going to communicate to them and draw them to you as well so ask that question where is your audience and understand that with branding especially you don 't want to try and do it all right i think it 's it 's really important to keep it simple you don 't need to go and spend lots of big money from the get-go you just need to commute you need to put it all together in a way that says this is who we are and this is what we stand for and it will speak on your behalf and some really important things to consider with branding and you know putting putting you out there is know that it is talking on your behalf you know so if you 're trying to produce a sustainable brand then maybe it is a very simple website with minimal colors right um you know the same with startup creative there is a lot of bold colors and and you know i guess youthful or fun tone because we 're trying to be relatable or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um so it 's gonna come down to your tone of voice your colors that you use um you know your layout if you 're running events what kind of venue what kind of catering what kind of music all of those things you know your packaging on your on your products all of that is an opportunity for you to tell your customer what you stand for um we also have a whole chapter in here that um goes through like all the back ends so tips on getting um wet your website coming up with your brand values is a really another important chapter in here where we talk about um you know what do picking out four to six core values that you as a brand want to stand for and that you think would relate to your customer and then how do you present that to across through platforms without necessarily having to be like we 're young and or where sustainable um but do that through all the different touch points where your customer will interact with you got some questions coming in here um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women 's reproductive rights and i want to be free across australian clinics but i need a government grant yeah i mean i think if you 're going to offer something for free then definitely um somebody 's got to pay for it so i think um grants fundraising crowdsourcing um maybe there 's there 's a philanthropist or investment firm there 's maybe some startup capital that you could get and perhaps maybe there 's like you you know one for one thing so if there 's you know maybe people who can afford things um or you know there 's you know it 's almost um and i think homey do it the the clothing brand here in melbourne of like uh for certain clothes that people buy they donate one for homeless so there 's lots of different business models that you can get in and around what i would do jasmine is to start researching and looking into what other business models are out there so there 's obviously grants and funding um but look and start looking into social enterprise models i think that could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ okay so you kind of package yourself up right there 's again i was just saying in here there 's um there 's advice in here on getting your copy so like your tone of voice together uh where where what websites what to consider for putting on your website all of that um there 's a bit of a checklist in there okay so then we 're gonna jump into marketing so we 've packaged ourselves up and now we want to jump into starting to then go and communicate what we do and find the people who are willing and able so marketing is simply communicating what you do to your target market so some things that i see often is content creation you might know this as instagram post you know uh email sending out email blasts a podcast blog post all of those things video youtube videos uh even tonight this is content creation right it 's me going out and giving some advice on what i do for free sometimes and giving a bit of a teaser and an insight into what you do and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ website or some tips on instagram uh sending out a mailing list with some recipes things like that so again coming back to the target market understanding not only why they 're coming to you for what you do but what else might they like you know so you know are you also going to show them a little bit of a your personal life of how you recondo your house you know or are you going to show them you know that you 're at a market on the weekend or you know other aspects as well that will be part of your brand values so creating that content it 's really important to not just go into sales sell sale or buy buy buy especially with marketing which you could do a whole webinar on um it is very much about relationship building so that content creation the mailing list coming up with all these different places that your audience is either engaging with you or could potentially find you and going out to them to be like hey this is what we do do you know about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also building that trust and rapport by giving away some content so the current kind of ratio is um i 'm sure it changes all the time but one in four pieces of content whether that 's posting on instagram or um mailing list blog posts uh should be a call to action so cta calls to action you don 't want to just be selling because it 's a lot of marketing trends and advertising trends are showing that that loses trust and people just are on guard to being sold to straight away if you can and your business is relevant then i definitely recommend being the face of the business or showing you know why you started it and your brand values and and what you do behind the scenes it 's very big on building that trust especially as we are in this online space where we are losing trust with you know bots and ads and algorithms uh the more that we can show face and be like this is me this is my brand this is my business this is why i do what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to build a trusted audience um by being a real person and measure everything keep an eye on your marketing so sometimes a lot of people will just be like cool i 'm gonna do all these marketing things i highly recommend picking out a couple again there 's a whole bunch of recommendations in the book uh giving them a go measuring it and seeing what works so you know if you if you 're sending an email and you get five inquiries or five sales from that then your audience likes hearing from you from email again you can be asking these questions directly to your audience or in groups and things like that oh one of my favorite chapters in the book is mindset hacks so you know there 's something that i 've learned over seven years is like i can give you the perfect business plan and a book on how to start a business and um you know the right marketing strategy and the best website uh but if you get up every day and you doubt whether you 're good enough or other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get scared to post on instagram because you don 't know what to say uh there are all those little minds tricks that are going on that all of us have all the time i need everyone to know that because we 're always uh struggling you know that there 'll always be more a bigger risk to take or you know things that don 't go right and will you know spiral into self-doubt um but some things that i 've really noticed is that those who are able to master that mindset of an entrepreneur and know that it 's it 's going to be a lot of unknowns it 's going to be scary it 's going to require risk or backing yourself when no one else backs you they 're all parts of the journey and they don 't necessarily go away if nothing else maybe they even get scarier and bigger the bigger that you get in business um but some things that have helped me have to have a morning routine so you know it 's in busy times it 's easy to want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on to emails and feeling like you can never have enough time in the day but starting a day with a really clear intention of what goal you 're setting out to achieve and then you know what i tend to do is write my to-do list the night before and or on a sunday evening i tend to just write it now the night before so the end of each day i 'll rewrite my to-do list so it 's ready to go and it 's really clear what needs to be done in my business so setting out okay what 's the next step for my business what it what needs to happen have i got my first paying customer have i done my marketing have i you know gone out and got in front of more of my target market today and then look at your to-do list and prioritize it around what is the outcome that you 're you 're wanting to achieve um so there 's a bunch of tips in there about overcoming procrastination and overwhelm and things like that coaches and mentors i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of my favorite parts of my job is to be able to inspire people to keep going when it gets hard and give them an outside perspective as well um and i really do believe you are the average of the people you spend the most time with so you know for me i remember going from people in nine to fives and i was like i 'm gonna start a business and i just didn 't get it eventually now all of my friends work for themselves or freelancers or run their own companies so um you find those people who can bounce the ideas off and get support from and knowing that it 's gonna get hard and that it 's not always gonna go to plan and almost every second day there 's a fire to put out or a website to fix or uh you know an email to reply to um but you can add a spiral into that and be like for me like this is so hard and you can give up everyone can give up there 's have they have that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that didn 't work what do i need to do to fix it and keep zooming out and and getting that perspective um i tend to find that that will keep you going on the path um so we 've got other chapters in there which we won 't go into all of them tonight but i 'll try and get to some questions so um there 's money mindset uh there 's uh tips on pricing in there um the power of building your team as well so like getting the accountants and outsourcing the things that necessarily aren 't your strong suit and there 's tips in there around goal setting which is i think very vital so once you kind of come up with that idea and you get it uh you test it out then you package it up and then you go out and find the people listen and learn and and keep setting new goals and be like great cool i got one customer and now have next month i 'm going to get three customers and and keep setting those goals because if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have something you 're working towards um it 'll be really easy to just get stagnant or to get distracted and and pulled in a different direction um or to just give up and feel like you 're not getting anywhere so one of your biggest things you really want to be able to do is just you know have that vision and for me it was saying that we wanted to be the go-to source for straight-up business advice for someone anywhere in the world who would say you know i have an idea for a business and i want to get off the ground and that somebody would say like you hit read this book or listen to this podcast or you know you should speak to kay from startup creative and i 'm so grateful that you know seven years ago when i was coming out of a really shitty job that i was so miserable in that i can sit here and say wow they i literally have coaching clients all around the world who have thought to come to startup creative to get that help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intention that you 've got to get up every single day and work in that direction and then the final chapter is scaling and beyond so once you 've kind of got that idea and i give you those first few chapters because once you start marketing and getting in front of your target market you can learn so much and you can grow and and what tends to happen is you you follow the energy of what what 's happening are people liking it what aren 't they lacking and remember to get out of your own way and know that it 's not necessarily about you it 's about being of service to your customer and so showing up for them or what they want and what they 're liking and and not liking okay and that 's a startup career that 's uh uh but i 've got some time i think a good 10 minutes for any questions um at what point would you recommend hiring a graphic designer can you diy yeah absolutely so um outsourcing is a big question which is hiring people i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was pretty horrible but i put it on top of a word document and wrote a course outline for how to turn a passion into a business and i went and i sold it to councils and universities and and that 's how i launched my business so it wasn 't flashy it got me by you know and i built my own website and then as i was making money in the business then i was like great i can now keep reinvesting in this and then eventually was able to um yeah upgrade my logo with a full branding package um but i think when it comes to outsourcing whether it 's graphic design or anything else you want to kind of consider um you know is this can i do this like canva is a really good one as well also friends and family like you know do do some good old bartering and being like you know can i help you out with this if you help me out with this um and canva is amazing for that as well and but get something out there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can afford it if it 's not on in the budget from the get go um do i have any tips on someone who is stuck in a creative rat feeling uninspired how to re-discover joy in their side i thought yeah great question um i would say sometimes if you 're in a creative rut you need a break and you know especially coming off the back of covid um sometimes the rut is there to show us that we we might need some perspective and so i 'm definitely not opposed to especially i 've learned this a lot this last two years um to just let the rut be there and to create space because often if we 're in a rut and we keep trying to push forward uh we don 't have new ideas our brain is in almost fight or flight and we 're kind of stuck during this kind of negative cycle and you actually need to be able to get out get a breather and and open your perspective up again and and fill yourself up creatively so you might want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of creating not to make money or to to hustle um you know spend time with other creative people and feel yourself creatively so i 'm really i love neuroscience and understanding the mind and i really you know when you feed your brain content that is creative and inspiring then you actually get firing new neural pathways which means that your brain has got more data and information points and can light up and and and solve things in in new and creative ways um also like having an outside perspective so whether that is sometimes for me it 's good friends sometimes it 's a coach uh sometimes it 's an accountant and someone being like cool like i 'm gonna just say what i see here or i 'm gonna reflect back to you what i think you 're good at or you know maybe you could move in it and that synergy of bouncing ideas um i think really helps so hopefully that helps um but yeah thank you so much everybody for being here and um i hope it has been helpful if you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you to leave a review somewhere on the internet would be helpful this is the best yeah kayleen what is the best or most memorable piece of advice that you received when you were starting out your business journey the quote that really helped me was uh whatever the mind can conceive and believe it can achieve and that was the quote that helped me to go i i need to get myself out of this rut and i can see a new future i can see this reality where i 'm not on a train for six hours a day and i don 't wake up with headaches and i 'm you know not miserable in my job and i started believing that i could work for myself and i wouldn 't have to work mondays if i didn 't want to and take holidays when i wanted to without like you know applying for leave and i just i held on to that vision it was my mind could conceive it and believe it and even though there was days where i was like is this even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept going yeah i 'm gonna keep putting one foot in front of the other and there is no such thing as an overnight success like it really you it 's it 's not a quick fix it really is taking one small step every day in the direction of that vision for sure i hope that helps thank you so much my absolute pleasure it 's so nice to be collaborating with libraries because i spent a lot of time in them growing up and um yeah sharing a book is like that 's where you want them to be right thank you thank you thank you really appreciate it we 've just got one last question here any tips on how to cut through in a crowded social media space yeah good question um crowded social media space um create unique content so be and i think authenticity is really cutting through at the moment on social media it 's really easy to you know post a nice photo and you know a caption that doesn 't really you know saying much but think about what 's your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and be of service to them or add value to their life and where possible try and give an authentic real human voice um because i think people are sick of just like the cut copy stuff um video is obviously very popular on social media if you can get your bring yourself to do it i know a lot of people get scared um but yeah what 's authentic to you you know when you try to be what other people are doing it 's going to come across fake and look like everyone else 's stuff so what 's your authentic voice and tone um and and you know how how are you showing up to solve problems or add value to the people who are following you uh because if you 're just posting for the sake of posting why would why would people stop um and then i think just my other piece of advice on social media is to get off it there 's um i just think it 's don 't put all your eggs in that basket is what i would say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know get out and do like networking with other people uh host events like get creative um in social media is one way but it is also it 's very tumultuous and it 's um as changing rapidly every day and it 's unpredictable so yeah it used to be a really powerful tool but i think it 's definitely losing a little bit of its cut through so some of that is out of our control and i would just say to safeguard yourself and create other ways to build an audience great thank you now i just wanted to say a big thank you kayleen for joining us this evening that was wonderful and um i jotted down a few things that you said and i 'm sure everyone else got a lot out of it and thank you for all the participants who attended we will be sending out a link or just some feedback now thank you that was awesome um so we 'll be sending out a link of the recording hopefully later in the week and adjust you can purchase how to start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to borrow it from your local library and we do have in the chat a little survey if anyone has um time to fill that in that would be wonderful so thanks again for joining us for the global learning festival and we 'll hope to see you soon thanks kayleen my pleasure thank you so much for having me thanks for being here everyone"

today so thank you all very much for joining us and just very briefly the format is as straightforward as it can be the acting ceo will speak the mayor will answer a few questions and then we throw it open to you and your participation is absolutely vital and that 's what we 're here for now on the zoom if you 're not familiar with it i 'll just very quickly run through if you move your mouse for a moment as well as seeing all the counselors and me and the other people here including an expert i 'll introduce in a moment down the bottom in the bar there 's a number of options for you and one of them on my screen it 's on the very right and that 's where it 'll be for most people it 's called q a and you can type in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you 've got a question that you think the council should address or you want our expert to address then you type the question there on the q a session section and uh that 'll get fed through to me and we 'll see if we can get through as many of your questions as possible quite apart from the ones that the councillors all have that undoubtedly have already been to some extent looked at before we go too far though we want to offer our respect to the elders of the lands that we meet on the kulan nation and through them to all aboriginal and torres strait islander people past present and emerging and all i would also like to personally express my impatience for a treaty or treaties a makarata which the victorian state government has committed to a process and hopefully in our lifetimes we 'll get to see that come to fruition because without it we can 't repair some of the damage that 's been caused in our past i 'd like to acknowledge first of all the mayor councillor michael clarke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the community on this occasion and then the councillors deputy mayor council anthony tran councillor cook lamb councillor bernadette thomas jorge jorgera council simon crawford councillor sarah carter has joined us and they 're all here not to take over the meeting but to contribute to the meeting and they 're all on call to answer any specific questions if you 've got a question to address to them individually that 's fine and we 'll of course try and hear from them all as we go through the acting chief executive celia haddock will join us in just a moment but i want to also thank and acknowledge that we have with us professor daryl efron from the murdoch children 's institute who 's an expert in the issue that we 're raising the medicinal cannabis issue and he 's available to answer any questions of a medical nature or a scientific nature so the counsellors have many skills and many areas of expertise but medicine and science is not amongst them so we will defer to him and he 's very generously given us his time for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ephron we just want to acknowledge that and thank you very much as well so i hope that makes it clear to everybody what 's going on we we should finish by seven o 'clock we might go over if there 's still a lot of questions unanswered we 'll see if we can stretch it a bit but that 's how things are going to go for the course of this first of public consultations now acting ceo celia haddock if i can hand over to you to set the scene thank you very much thank you john and uh good evening everyone and we are here tonight to look at medicinal cannabis whether it 's an enterprise that you would like the maribyrnong city council to to look into and develop thanks kate so how this came about was at the ordinary council meeting on the 14th of september council resolved to seek community views on council setting up a business to cultivate produce and manufacture medicinal cannabis and there will be a further report to council in february after all the consultation has been completed on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forum and i think john 's gone through this so i 'll just be brief it 's really an opportunity for you to ask questions we 've got the mayor and councillors and professor efron here to respond and if you 've got any questions as john said please put them in the q a at the bottom of your screen and today is not the only opportunity to have your say we have um a lot of information on your city your voice there 'll be information coming out in the maribyrnong messenger and we will be giving you until the end of i think about the 10th of january to respond to us thank you kate medicinal cannabis as a venture has been seen as a way for council to seek alternative revenue and and the big complaint that we get from people is that rates are very high and we do understand that that is the case uh medicinal cannabis would also provide an opportunity to boost local employment in maribyrnong and they 'd be likely flow on impacts in relation to research and development initiatives within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffering chronic illness particularly those for whom conventional treatments aren 't working thanks kate there are a lot of regulations in this area and some of you will be aware of these as well so any venture of this nature has to meet the local government act requirements 2020 be consistent with council 's revenue and rating plan meet the requirements of the local planning scheme and meet the conditions to obtain a licence and permit from the office of drug control thanks kate it 's the proposal itself is an opportunity for the council to partner with government and private industry science and experts to establish a business that promises benefits in terms of those points i mentioned earlier there would be significant hurdles to overcome so there is we know this is a long journey if if you tell the council you want the council to proceed it 's not something that will happen tomorrow um however the next steps assuming this if there is community appetite for us to proceed would be a feasibility study a risk assessment and then moving into a full business plan thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ model would be considered so at this point we certainly haven 't considered an operational model and that could be indoor outdoor greenhouse a range of options there we 'd also be looking at the costs the time frames and the business structure and only then would council be able to consider the sites and potential monetary investment and that fees about feasibility study could be well in excess of a hundred thousand dollars so we have to prepare that brief and we would need to put that to tender so we 're not we don 't know yet what the price of that will be thanks kate so the next steps are for council as you know we 're currently seeking to understand if the community is on board with the idea and we certainly do want to hear your q as tonight a further report to council as i said in february and then if the idea is supported council will embark on that feasibility study including commercial and legal due diligence and costings thanks kate so i 'm now going to hand back to john who 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you celia haddock so talking is what it 's about we have an opportunity to thrash out the attitude and to get a a toe in the water a taste of what the community 's appetite is for a project of this kind it 's innovative it 's exciting it 's different it 's bold but what do you make of it positives and negatives risks opportunities all of those things there are many unknowns and there are undoubtedly there are questions that at this stage no one will know the answers to but even then it 's important if you 've got a question to which there isn 't an immediate answer you still ask it so that we know what are the sorts of things that are on people 's mind and that way council can work out where this is likely to go so we want to start a dialogue it 's not a monologue from council to community it 's a dialogue between council and community so councillors will answer when they can i 'll try and make sure everyone gets a chance to have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ section i get it again at the bottom of the screen and they 'll come through to me and we may not get through all the questions tonight but we 'll try to make sure we get a representative sample and i 've made it clear that it 's important that this isn 't just pr it 's not just spin it 's not just oh we 're only going to take comments that are supportive if there are critical questions then they need to be addressed as well and if we don 't get through every question today as celia said your city your voice is where you 'll get an opportunity to continue the discussion beyond now this proposal came as you 've seen from councillor michael clark who put the notice of motion on the table and it 's therefore appropriate to start with the mayor and ask him exactly where this idea came from and why he thinks it 's a good thing to do counselor clark yeah thanks john uh and before i commence i do uh on behalf of council want to acknowledge that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uh i shall offer our respects to the elders of these traditional lands and through them to all aboriginal and torres strait islander people past present and emerging the idea very much uh came from discussions that i was having during the august september october period of last year what became really evident to me was that people are hurting financially um apart from the right rates which we are on the higher end of the the rating continuum so you know always thinking about what can we do about that but what really accelerated that concern was covert and looking at the financial impact of covert on our community and it being very uh very stark to me that really while we can continue to go back to the community just as a matter of course to uh to raise revenue through our rating system uh people are finding it hard so it 's incumbent on me incumbent i think on council to look at uh alternative uh revenue sources so that 's where it came from looking to try and relieve the rate burden the financial burden on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other commercial yeah what 's interesting is that um council has to be really careful about the type of business that it gets into we can 't afford to go into a business where if we already see you know a young family a family you know the free enterprise operating in that space already we wind up uh undercutting or uh uh infringing on the uh the market of those in an established industry so this is very much what 's best perhaps described as a new horizons industry it 's a a an industry in its infancy but what we know is that the the industry has significant growth potential and it 's that growth potential that uh forms the heart of why we look at this particular industry so we 're not we 're not uh having to worry about competitive neutrality we 're not uh competing with our constituents we 're looking at an industry that really in terms of outcomes is fundamentally positive you know we 're looking at an industry that will have an impact hopefully on rheumatoid arthritis multiple sclerosis palliative care epilepsy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of illness conditions or states that this uh this particular uh industry addresses so it 's a it 's an industry that for me is close to my heart i i come from a human services background and i think that that that particular sense resonates with the other councillors as well so whereas we could we could go out and we could actually we could put in place a brewery we could open a pub but that doesn 't necessarily accord with the value system of this council so a new horizons industry very strong uh opportunity for uh for growth and it 's in an area that we think uh makes a significant uh impact on the health and well-being of the war community and just finally how important is the community 's view in deciding council 's attitude to whether to proceed or not given that you 've told us it 's as much as anything driven by a concern about the narrow financial base of the council going into the future how important is it the sort of feedback you get from meetings like this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how directive will a meeting like this be in deciding whether you proceed or not yeah look uh and i i 'm very clear about this i think the council was are very clear about this no counsellor was elected to council on a platform of we 're going to grow or propose to grow medicinal cannabis none of us so we don 't have um an authority that 's been given to us by the electorate so we have to go back to the electorate to seek their endorsement to seek their authority to to go to the next stage so uh community community endorsement is absolutely fundamental here john and i say that to the the community five years ago we couldn 't have done this type of consultation this level of consultation so we 're we 're lucky uh [Music] if you like there 's a silver lining from from covered you know we 're able to engage in a zoom uh town hall meeting so we 're able to engage with the community we want to listen to the community community we will be directed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any of the councillors they will talk about the whole notion of engagement and transparency as being fundamental uh uh dimensions to how they want to see council operate so reconciling this is an idea with the community is core and critical to us all right i 'll try and share the love around between the councillors because nearly everyone 's here and will defer to professor ephron if we get a question that requires medical or scientific knowledge in the answer i see there 's 15 questions already waiting and we 'll see how we go first question is from mark vander and mayor i 'll direct this to you there are hundreds of companies much further advanced in medicinal cannabis ventures already and certainly the experience in north america it 's been an astonishing growth area why should council get involved in a venture like this an area where you have no expertise um again john it 's um whilst there may be hundreds of uh [Music] businesses with an interest in the area and uh i think that there 's more more licenses with that are sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so uh the the the size of the business the size of the number of participants uh doesn 't quite equal the number of licenses that are really out there first point second point is the the growth you know as has been said you know uh north america uh canada um amsterdam holland the netherlands just to name a a couple of uh jurisdictions uh it 's there it 's growing uh pre-covered 2019 australia the business was worth 177 million um the projection for 2025 is 1.5 billion uh 2028 it 's gone up to uh uh three billion in excess of three billion dollars so although there are a number of uh potential uh players uh there 's there 's ample room to actually establish ourselves as a uh a meaningful player uh council 's role like not not having expertise now we 'll buy that in that we 've got uh people who have already indicated uh an interest in assisting council so and we we understand that it 's like any industry um at once and i say this uh at one stage years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utility core and critical utility yet the council was in that business so uh being uh in something that 's not beyond roads uh and rubbish is uh is not new to council we 're able to do this all right any other councillors very quickly if you want to just give me a wave and obviously we can 't get every council to answer every question but if you give me a wave when you want to jump in and this is a fairly foundational question i 'll try and get to you just very quickly anybody anybody yes councillor tran thanks john yeah so that 's been that question i think the other thing we 're looking at is that the key point there was there are international um private industries that are doing it already the point is the international so the thing we 're taking out here is the need for tariffs import taxes and all that stuff and that really reduces the cost of um selling the product obviously if you 're a private firm you want to recoup the money that you 've lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produce it locally we 're taking that out of the picture essentially reducing costs for what is already quite an expensive product so not only are we able to you know generate revenue for our community but we 're offering that um hopefully a cheap alternative to what is already being offered overseas all right uh question about the council 's openness about this uh you say you 've been working on this and staff have been looking at it for months and there 's been a legal opinion already so how open and up front really is the council being with the community how much money has already been spent and how much of council resources have already been put into investigating this venture just to get it even to this stage and i think implicit in that question let 's not beat around the bushes you have no mandate for making that commitment so far so mayor maybe you could address that and i 'll see if other councils want to join in afterwards thanks john uh the uh dan if you do damn if you don 't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that actually had to be done uh uh for council to actually be able to consider uh the motion uh to go forward to consider uh the enterprise so in the first instance uh we had to seek legal advice are we are we in within the legislation does the legislation let us do this yes or no yes it does um [Music] what uh what 's the size of the market out there what are the market opportunities again that was uh undertaken uh by our some internal project offices um in terms of uh overall outlays and expenditure uh on the venture so far i think we 've racked up five thousand dollars it could be slightly more than that but uh plus or minus it 's around five thousand dollars um and again why aren 't we spending uh great sways of money on this because we 're not authorized like we could we could do it and for years councils in the past have just up and down things with or without community endorsement of support but given that the nature of what we 're trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much as we would like to to make a meaningful impact on rates uh yeah it really does need the community to be along with with us on the journey because the the risk reward equation it 's it 's not worth taking a huge risk for a small reward if you 're going to take a risk you want to you want to do something that 's got a decent reward but let 's quickly go counsellors thomas o 'hara carter crawford yes councillor simon crawford please go ahead yeah thanks john i just noticed my name as part of this question so i thought i 'd quickly jump in um as uh the mayor says you know we 've spent a few thousand dollars on this at this stage so um you know i would consider that to be a very small amount of money um considering the potential amounts we 're talking you know 100 000 plus just for a feasibility study a business case um and then you know most likely millions to um actually do the venture if that 's where we go um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perspective and and sort of say that look that 's the whole point of all this consultation is do we have that mandate um you know none of us should run for the council elections um saying that this is what we 're going to do so it is a very new idea and it 's important that we get that early mandate if we 're going to kick on with it so that 's what we 're doing now alrighty jacob goldschlager has asked with a bit of an introduction i 'm certainly not against the idea or applaud creative thinking from council to build economic sustainability but are there other councils local government areas elsewhere in australia or worldwide that are engaging in this industry that this council could learn from because jacob goldschleiger says being the first mover in this space is inherently more risky best practice from others would likely be beneficial and against the risks of being a first mover of course are the advantages of being a first mover to offset that as well but councillor clark backers this is mayor this is your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ council in australia we 're aware of has gotten into the idea of actually manufacturing producing and manufacturing medicinal cannabis so yes it is new and with that there is a risk um we know that uh council in northern new south wales uh has been involved in facilitating uh the growing of uh medicinal cannabis but not necessarily directly involved in the production themselves recognize that but at the same time whilst there is a risk that 's where the opportunity lies for us uh a market scan again showing us the growth potential yes we can we can hang back and let others do it for us but then we 're playing catch-up footy uh in an industry where uh my anxiety is that it could fill up and quite simply um [Music] other uh whether it 's free enterprise or uh other jurisdictions uh other local government jurisdictions get into the market and quite simply uh we 've we 've missed the opportunity you know we 're we 're in the market too late so uh we 've got to be to me again given the growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uh take the opportunity as it now exists all right any other councillors at this stage going once going twice moving on arthur bridgianis has asked what happens if the venture goes south and ends up costing the council money it 's the rates then if it goes well how does the rates cap get managed what guidelines would be introduced in regard to the baseline of rates garnering if there 's a low year in other words and he continues on if the rates get reduced by 10 million will rates garnered on the ratepayers be reduced accordingly or would it be a windfall to council 's coffers but let 's deal with the first part of his question first everyone would of course if you went into this they 'd hope that it succeeds but what does happen if it fails and you do your dough oh john i don 't mind saying um that that that 's the classic um uh nothing ventured nothing gained nothing ventured nothing lost there is it does not matter what you do there is an element of risk and yes absolutely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crawford 's pointed out our uh investment uh will be in the millions to start with but it 's not going to be at a a level where it 's going to be detrimental and have an impact on on rates not at all go the other way for the same for that same investment if it blossoms and we anticipate it blossoming and uh we actually uh anchoring ourselves in the markets and being able to uh turn a profit the return on investment will be far far greater than uh the other way uh the the potential losses if if it went completely south so yes you you have no illusions and i hope no one has any illusions you know you it 's if you 're betting on a horse race not everyone 's going to win and it doesn 't matter what venture we get into anything any we raise a waste recovery you know you could lose on that it does not matter what we do there 's always a potential risk in terms of the the uh the impact on rates for any returns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all go to rates won 't go to any counsellor won 't go to uh uh any any shareholder the idea is it goes to rates in order to relieve the pressure of what otherwise are incessant rises right across local government the the demand that local government deliver more with a finite rate space so this is designed to give you another source of income and again and all councillors will attest to this everything costs we have we have a choice here and i say this to the community we have a choice we can reduce your rates no worries maternal and child health services they can go library services they can go we can stop supporting our sporting clubs not a worry you know we could we can we can slow down our capital works pro program you know we don 't have to do any repairs to any of the community halls slow all that down that 's a way of like uh of reducing our expenditure however you do that and it is at our peril you know i 've been to countries where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some eloquence and authority on that so we 've got a choice either we cut or we and it 's three-way we cut we go back to the people and say we 're going to increase your rates again or we look at alternatives and this is an alternative all right i think that was an invitation to your counselor o 'hara if you wanted to join in now but you don 't have to i 'm just offering you the chance now if i was ready for it but happy to say a couple of words perhaps actually take up a couple of questions that are a bit further up also but just on on that point of michael 's there i i think everyone 's well aware of the fact i think certainly everyone here certainly all of council and probably all or all councils in victoria uh likewise are aware of the fact that rights are by no means a perfect system to put it politely the dilemma we have though that is that neither can council establish a budget uh entirely for rate payers only this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and breathe our lga are not rate payers so of course the budget has to be considered at a higher sort of social public good level um obviously keeping in mind that you know rate payers are putting in alliance share not all but alliance share of the income it is an imperfect system there 's no question about that uh but we 've got to keep in mind that you know those library services are for rate payers they 're also for people who aren 't paying rates we also have you know certain restrictions in terms of rates that i would like to see gone but can 't be legally so for example you know i i 'd rather that there were higher rates paid by people who don 't live in now lga but have investment properties so that people who actually live and breed our lga uh you know uh wouldn 't have to burn such a big share of the income necessities so on to the other question i think it 's been posed a couple of times about the management and so forth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this or another business proposition um i can 't speak for councillors but i have already made it very clear publicly that uh i certainly am not interested in supporting any business uh set up where we have to pump in public council monies to set up a business that will then line the pockets of a private enterprise not interested in that at all i 'm interested in setting up a business that can show us what you can do with a publicly owned and run enterprise to to support back to bring that those gains those financial gains back into our community community 100 that 's what i 'm interested in and i hope hopefully if we take go down this road this can be a bit of a model uh for our council in this regard and for other councils in this regard also i 'll leave it at that thanks john thank you and i see that councillor sarah carter wants to speak and i will come to you in a second but just picking up on a question that 's come through as you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said a moment ago and someone has said that they support the idea but if the venture 's successful would you sell it off in the future in the way for instance that the people 's republic of moorland did with their electricity supply made a windfall from selling it off i i don 't mind saying and this is where again the the the level of alignment with the the council 's council laws here is uh well again i 'll let the councillors speak for themselves no the city of footscray the old city of footscray had an electricity company and a fellow called jeffrey kennett made the city of footscray sell our electricity company to the sec and then we were told that they were going to sell off the sec and we 're all going to have cheaper electricity well the selling bit got worked really well the bit that didn 't work too good was the cheaper electricity we 've been suffering the ignominy of that as a decision for two decades now no no no sorry that 's not going anywhere it 's ours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money of course you can 't bind future councils but that certainly can be part of how you said it 's le carter i did notice before and i put you on hold can we bring you in now please thank you so much and i will be brief um just building on the comments by the mayor um and by councillor hawkera and i just want to go back to the concerns and questions that were raised by arthur um just to echo that they 're shared by many councillors as well i seconded this motion i support the mayor in um looking into this he michael has certainly put some uh quite a bit of effort into this and has a knowledge he 's you know this is a passion project for him and he 's brought it to council with enough of a compelling case but i certainly have a lot of questions and when we talk about risk appetite there is absolutely an inherent risk but what i would say is that i probably would be erring on the side of being quite cautious when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect to see a really robust and vigorous uh due diligence process there needs to be governance you know mandates in place i was elected back in 2008 it 's quite a while ago now and we had debt and you um a lot of residents will remember we used to put two percent on top of cpi on top of rates to make up our backlog i don 't want to go back to those days i will not sit on council and in good faith and prove something where the risk threshold is far too great so i just want to echo that we are in the very early stages very early stages there are a lot of questions we share your questions but the overarching idea i think is a good one i think it 's worth exploration but i just want to give some sense to residents that you know it is early on there are a lot of questions and we too share and i want to know you know exactly what the risk i want to know within an inch of as much as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know looking at worst and best case scenario to make an informed be entering into something like this lightly is certainly the mayor as well because i know we were both on council in those days when council had debt and it took a lot of hard work to get out of it so i just want to make that point abundantly clear thank you and councillor cook lamb has also got her hand up and then we 'll go to a question for professor ephron okay thank you ron um i would um hear other counselors said and i also you know i hardly agree with that i think that 's why for me is where we have a very um comprehensive consultation with the community particularly about the community with diverse backgrounds so we already have some contact with a number of community leader and ask them to come to talk to us and meet with them and they can pass that information around to their community as well so i mean this is not the only forum and i hope there 'll be more people to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honestly we will listen and listen what the community said thank you all right thank you very much professor ephron there 's a question asking about what the what what 's the potential in the demand in australia at the moment what what are the the parameters within which a proposal like this should be seen yeah i could make two or three comments i think in response to the discussion so far that i think might help the debate um firstly um so i 'm a pediatrician um and i do clinical trials i 've been immersed in this space for about five years now um it 's a pretty crazy industry and i 've been con i had a lot of contact with industry players as well as regulators through the different government channels and so on um and firstly there 's been a comment that you know um it 's better to have australian product or victorian product than overseas products um i 'll say some things that people some people will know if they 've done some reading but there 's well over 30 australian licenses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few in victoria and there 's quite a few of these companies i mean they raise tens of millions of dollars through venture capitalists it 's a really expensive industry to establish a lot of people have done a lot of work on the basic agricultural science um in this country following on from work done in canada and israel and the united states and other countries it 's a very complicated process to to do this well and to grow good quality medicinal grade pharmaceutical products mo all the companies in australia that i 've spoken as quite a few have had significant roadblocks and delays along the way it takes a long time before you can get product to market let alone and the market is becoming increasingly crowded so any doctor can prescribe any medicinal cannabis product for any patient at the moment they just have to apply to get a permit to make a justification to the therapeutic goods administration under something called the special access scheme and when you do that you have to it 's different to any other drug but you have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it and month by month the number of available products to a doctor prescribing in the drop-down boxes you have to select the product is growing exponentially so it 's already a really crowded market there 's hundreds of products to to choose from i think it 's important people in this conversation understand that it 's not as though the market 's crying out for new people to provide product there 's plenty of product available already it 's very expensive and you know everyone particularly consumers hope the costs come down but that 's a difficult thing to achieve because it actually is very expensive to produce this stuff has that been the experience in north america in canada in western california and washington state i think have gone down this path um holland obviously what 's been the experience there you mean in terms of cost or the marketplace or the price look i think it 's expensive i don 't have a good understanding of that john that really i 'm not an authority on that but i know it 's at least moderately expensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i understand but i i 'm not an authority on pricing in other countries because of course in many of those countries they 've also got now a legalized and regulated recreational marijuana yeah yeah canada is a good example that that changes the whole scene quite dramatically i think yeah yeah yep and there 's a tax revenue there and governments have pretty much worked out that rather than trying to make money out of running the business they 'll just let other people run the business and tax it but that 's not an option for local government in australia but i wouldn 't be at all surprised if we go down that path eventually here but i 'm going right off the reservation now was that all you wanted to say professor ephron yeah i 'm happy to answer now the question i guess i 'll just explain something else that people would know and that is there is more of medicinal cannabis being prescribed particularly for adults i 'm a pediatrician there 's not much being prescribed for kids although that 's growing a little bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions for which there 's interest in this and the market will continue to grow so there 's no doubt it 's it 's a potentially lucrative market if you can become an important player all right there 's lots of questions coming through and i 've kind of lost track if i don 't name the person who sent this apologies it 's back in the history uh there was a question which either councillor clark mayor clark or maybe even the acting ceo cd had it can answer which was about collaborating with state government or accessing government grants to limit the risk the exposure of council funds to establishing a venture like this matt yeah look uh and i think the ceo can speak to the detail of what the funding streams are from the state government but there are certainly uh grant opportunities there that we 'd look to tap into uh as a way of trying to offset any council investment and just to say uh against that there 's no intrigue the premier and the premier 's office are aware of this venture i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uh after the grand final uh before the grand final yeah i don 't think he 's taking calls for several days um suggestion he 's going to announce um a sudden tax on ski chains and ski lodges final but it hasn 't happened i 'm not uh i 'm not going there [Music] but the attorney general knows about it the minister for health knows about it the minister for local government knows about it so a state government level uh everyone is completely ok with what the strategic intent uh is of council what what what the resolution is going to get going to council pass by council so no intrigue there in fact the the state government were very have on guard a few years ago in this space they 've tended to hand over their interest to the free enterprise sector but they 're still making uh grants available uh celia would you like to speak to the grants opportunities thank you mr mia and yes there are federal and state opportunities interestingly uh the the uh incentives for people is in terms of startups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we would be a not-for-profit uh coming into uh into the industry and uh wanting to access those funds so uh we we have had a look there are some opportunities um particularly in our early stages and uh we will be taking taking those up and uh talking to the relevant government ministers about that but i would just stress as all the counsellors have said this is a not-for-profit venture so none of the councillors uh will be driving around in brand new cars or all the offices and so it 's it 's a new way for the government to be looking at it as well and governance models so is it is it even at this very very early stage is it is it in anybody 's mind what sort of a creature it would be that takes on this that 's that distinguishes between its management on the one hand and the management of the council 's other business on the other yeah i might just um come in there that councils under the local government act are allowed to have what 's called a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um uh separately to the council but is owned by the council so a good one that people will know about a city-wide who you might see picking up waste in the streets so that is a controlled entity of um melbourne city council as is the uh victoria market actually they 're both controlled entities of melbourne so um but they have independent boards who are appointed by the council to run the business for the council without the individual councils being involved yeah but i mean in terms of governance we haven 't had that discussion yet john it depends on the model but um we can 't i 'm just saying we can go down the controlled entity path and that would probably be one i think the councillors would want to consider all right there 's lots more questions councillor bernadette thomas so far we 've not heard from you there 's no obligation to but i just thought i 'd make you feel welcome in case you wanted to join in because we 've only got another less than 10 minutes no thanks john i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it being a not-for-profit model is hopefully of interest to people in that you know we 're not as michael said we 're not kind of aiming to set something up and sell it to the highest bidder we 're aiming you know if it goes through to set something up for the community so i think that 's probably an important point to make um as well as you know it 's early days and the feasibility study you know we don 't have all of these answers answers to all of the questions we have the same questions that the community has but we 're hoping that the feasibility study will at least um i guess give us give all of us that comfort around the level of risk um and what the next step what 's possible and what the next step will be all right thank you uh question anonymous the city is very short of open space and some of the land in the city is contaminated is the plan to grow within the boundaries of the of the council area and if not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bambang and if it is then how do you overcome that problem ma 'am yeah but that 's all part of the actual uh business case john um what we can say is that uh uh we won 't be uh encroaching into any of our uh open space that 's uh that we need for recreation uh as we won 't be encroaching we wouldn 't be looking at setting up anything in a residential precinct at all this is a very prescribed industry there are a number of ways of growing it greenhouse locked facility completely locked facility and it 's all uh hydroponic under lights um so but again let 's not put the cart before the horse that would be part of the uh the business case that uh council would consider so we 're certainly the the the the no go areas are obviously open space for recreation no we 're not going that 's not going to be encroached upon growing it anywhere close to residential uh housing no that won 't be happening either we 've got ample uh industrial sites right throughout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were on the precipice some years ago of really flipping much of our industrial land but we 've managed to keep it and that 's been to our advantage and there 's a question that 's highly speculative but does anyone have any idea about the sort of number of jobs we 're talking about we 're talking about a handful of jobs are we talking about a huge number of jobs is there any indication of the range not wanting to pin anybody down at all i wouldn 't like to actually venture a guess on that but i 'd be hopeful uh that it would be a grower if it would be a growing industry uh where no pun intended there where uh even for a relatively uh in the scale of things and i take on wood what uh professor efron had said about you know tens of millions going into uh in you know some of these companies we don 't need to go down that path not at all so we would actually start small and we would organically grow the industry so we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the industry uh it 's not just a case of physically growing in terms of its uh yield capacity but also its relationships with uh universities with academic institutions uh with the uh people like patrick mcgorry for example uh having him involved so the the industry as uh we would have it would be growing in a number of areas and it would would take a number of years all right and it 's a mix of jobs as i understand it some are highly skilled and some are just agriculture jobs i think the point was well well made uh when you know someone 's saying well you don 't have the expertise that 's right because it is as professor efron said you know that making this stuff uh you don 't do it in a bucket in the backyard you know it is highly technical you 've got to bring in experts uh and again this country has lost much of its manufacturing base you know this is a a very small contribution back into you know australia perhaps getting involved in some local manufacturing let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know and and let 's have something like this uh underpinned by a strong academic research agenda you know it 's there are there are a number of wins here running out of time but there 's a question addressing the difference and the distinction between residents and rate payers and not all residents are rate payers what are the benefits to residents who aren 't rate pays they don 't get any reduction in their rates uh yeah well you might be a renter and uh and i i will defer also to councillor who here on this you might be a renter john um and the the rent level that you you 're currently experiencing uh it isn 't just a case of uh you know repayment to the bank uh it 's also at a residential level uh the the the council rates that have to be paid and that 's that 's generally by the owner uh so if if the owner of a property doesn 't have to pay out as much for someone who is not a rate payer uh they might not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes exactly did you want to speak to that oh just to reiterate i think it 's effectively by the point i made earlier which is council only has one budget there 's no there 's not one budget for rate payers and one budget for non-rate pays it has one budget and any gains in that budget will be of assistance or of help for the whole community you know it 'll mean better library services better uh welfare services support for neighborhood houses etc so uh it 's definitely something that would um if successful would definitely be spreading the love around all right and before we run out of time is there anything and any other councillors we 're just about five minutes from when we said we 'd try to finish lots and lots of questions there 's more than 50 questions have come through but a lot of them are covering ground that other people have covered so we 're not going to go through repeating ourselves and as i mentioned before there 's an opportunity to continue the discussion after tonight but just before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are there other councillors who wanted to add something before we 're out of time anyone at all no no everybody 's very happy excellent uh just one final question if i may from me um if indeed the community say no we 're not interested and through whatever process you come up with they say no we 're not interested would you look at other ventures of a similar kind using this idea this model i 'm not suggesting council lord him back into the growing i think potentially scandalous world of cryptocurrency but uh if there was some other venture of similar financial appeal does that entrepreneurial zeal and spirit extend beyond a proposal simply for medicinal cannabis uh yes it does john and uh uh i 'll be bringing a notice of motion uh to council next month with uh another uh venture that uh again uh council or like whilst i 'll be bringing it all councillors uh a part of the the next proposal again the strategic intent john is to uh come up with an enterprise that will reduce the financial burden on family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arises because as i say it 's its growth potential we 're not having to run into competitive neutrality issues with uh other players who are locals uh in the industry um as well as it being uh something that we we actually believe in as something that can help assist the health and well-being of the community this next venture that will come up uh uh in october uh later this uh next month uh has the same principles at its foundation and again we 'll uh we 'll go to the community and seek their their endorsement and support because it too as an enterprise has not been uh authorized by the community and that 's what we 're about uh a transparent and or yeah a transparently engaged council well the time has flown so just some concluding remarks uh if you could mr mayor and then we 'll thank everybody for participating and explain how they can continue to contribute after tonight firstly to everyone who 's participated to the community who 've come online thank you all so much uh as was said earlier in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is not the only time that you can have your say we 've in fact extended the consultation period so if it will go into early 2022 please let us know what you think at the moment and i have to say at the moment uh of some almost 500 responses that we 've received almost 75 percent of those responses are saying they support council uh going to the next stage of the developing a business plan uh that again will be brought to the community and i just want to say this will be a gated process we will not be progressing unless the community gives us their endorsement and authorization so even if we get the tick on this if we go to the business case and the business case falls over we will not be proceeding again it will be reconciled with the community thank you very much mayor and to all the councillors thank you very much interacting ceo celia haddock now all the questions and answers to them from tonight 's very interesting discussion will be available on your city your voice next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let them know as soon as those are available so that you 're alerted to the fact that those answers are there i congratulate the city of marignon for having the initiative and being bold enough to do what so often councils aren 't prepared to do which is to break out of the narrow confines of the typical roads rates and rubbish profile that i think limits so much of what we get from this most vital and proximate tier about three government three tiers of government system democracy in action it 's what everyone says they always want and that 's what we 've seen tonight it 's little baby steps towing the water stuff so far and who knows from the most simple seeds great trees can grow we 'll see where it goes to thank you again for the opportunity i hope it 's been as informative for everybody else as it 's been for me our thanks again to professor efron for giving us his time so generously which i know is difficult in a busy schedule we 'll see where it gets to from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the invitation have a good evening and let 's see where it goes to next good night"

    "text": "[Music] good afternoon everyone and welcome to a very special mural library service event my name 's kerry i am the branch librarian for bray brook library and i 'd like to begin by acknowledging that we are meeting in various locations on the lands of the cooling nation and i would like to pay my respects to their elders past and present of the bunarong the womerong and the waranjari people on whose land i live and work alice and bruno are very dear friends of maribyrnong library service and their very dear friends themselves as well alice grew up in footscray in braybrook and congratulations alice on the publication of your latest book 100 days those of us who haven 't read it yet can 't wait to get our hands on a copy and bruno you 're well known in our area as a literary host as a supporter of the arts and a very strong advocate for refugees and we 're very proud of you for that without further ado i would like to hand over to bruno and alice thank you kerry thank you gab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's great libraries change lives i 'm living proof of that hello alice pung how are you good how are you going bruno i 'm in good form paradoxically we we seem to be meeting a lot in the zoom world don 't we we 're good friends and i haven 't had a chance to hold your baby very often but um we get to have these deep and meaningful conversations in this rather bizarre time and i feel fortunate for that congratulations on a superb book it 's a story very nice thank you inadequate love isn 't it really yeah and lots of other things but um yeah i love the book and i haven 't read the last 40 pages yet i just want to declare that to the audience so i don 't run into divulging anything and because i keep it as a treat so when our series is over we were meant to be doing this in the braybrook library and i remember when the maribyrnong libraries invited us to do that and there was there was a feeling of kind of childlike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the library being there looking at each other eye to eye having real people in the flesh in the audience people we know people we don 't know i sensed that it was going to be something extra special for you being back in bray brook was i mean oh yeah it was bruno because i grew up in bray brook i spent the first 16 years of my life there um back when i was growing up in brave brook we didn 't have a book library but there was a tool library uh for men so you could see what kind of suburb it was back then and i loved growing up in bravery and something really special happened when the library um was built i think they asked me to launch uh come to the opening launch and talk about how special it is now that braybrook has a library now unfortunately the day of the launch i think i went into labor and gave birth to my first son so that 's how i always i remember the day of braybrook libraries launch as my son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last person i interviewed there was les twenty men for his book a couple of years back and you 're a great supporter of his cause and all of that tell me as a grown woman now with three kids and your life has changed hugely in that time what 's it like when you when you mosey on through the streets of footscray and brave brook again is there a sense of going i am deeply in this place this place is deeply in me i think so bruno yeah it 's a very much i 'm in footscray a few you know a couple of times a week i come back to braybrook to do some programs for less 20 men and also to talk to some you know there 's lots of schools in bray brook and around that area so i 'm still with the students what 's so um wonderful is i give a lot of school talks but when i go back to bray brook or footscray or st albans those students you can see something uh i i don 't want to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they think oh there 's like a rider that comes in the western suburbs like that 's something that we could do possibly you know so so it means a lot for me to go back yeah hani rayson i think coming to one of the gigs that i hosted oh maybe a decade ago would always go i feel like i 'm in alice poole territory was like your novel had not given the place its identity but but but there was no delineation between the world of your writing and and and the physical world of footscray and braybrook i thought it was an enormous compliment to you oh thanks bruno it was yeah it was a big deal here i sometimes go back to places i grew up in and i just especially in a time when i 'm feeling maybe a little bit out of sorts in that you don 't go wandering with your kids and just go that was the house we lived in that was the window that got broken by the pest across the road the playground that that only had one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of stuff oh not not with my kids so far just um so we did live in a little house in bray brook and you know people chucked rocks in our windows so uh maybe when they 're older because it wasn 't a pleasant experience to be honest and we lived behind a carpet factory um as some of you who are listening would know the invicta carpet factory yeah there 's some wonderful places in brave rook i 'll take them too but maybe not not just yet there 's no place like the place we were born into and the era we were born into our fascination with that lasts forever doesn 't it alice i think so yeah there 's a great australian writer who passed away recently called kate jennings and she said that most writers spend their whole entire lives trying to figure out what went wrong in their first 12 years of life so i guess that 's why we go back to our childhood places i could do a whole conversation just on that observation but we 've got lots to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done together alice and there 's ella 's going oh he 's gone can you just give me a stream of consciousness kind of tumbling out of this list of saying not this book is about karuna and her mother but tell me the themes that you think are in the book and even after you 've written the themes that you kind of realize are there that you maybe didn 't even intend to consciously put in there as i said your book is about flawed anxious inadequate love at one level tell me a few other things that it 's about the themes oh okay another theme is about judgment and how we judge other people according to how much we perceive they love or don 't love their children so for example um like you know i think my mum was watching a non-asian person in the park feed her child and when her child wasn 't interested and went off to play my mum said look they don 't love their child as much as we love our children because their child isn 't eating and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a couple of weeks ago i was in at a supermarket in carleton and this is quite common i grew up in bray brook where parents would yell at their kids in supermarkets i i don 't mean don 't pull that off the shelf but just yelling you 've rebra why did you do that you know that kind of yelling and a lady stopped and i 've never seen this before growing up but this was um middle class erin carlton this lady stopped and said to that mum how dare you how dare you this is abuse you can 't talk to your child like that and then walked off and i thought wow i and so the 100 days is also about class how we talk to our children does is does that constitute abuse i don 't know most people in braybrook were severely abusive so that they 're the things i was grappling with when i was writing 100 days which is set in the western suburbs and if people come back to you who 've read it and gone your book um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took me into this place and and you thought wow look at a book i i i feel i know it intimately and yet it 's got its unknowns to me too oh yeah that 's that 's a great point bruno i think recently um an interviewer said to me and i because i talked about how i was quite responsible for my younger siblings from a very young age when i was nine um for looking after them not just babysitting but full-on full-time looking after them during school holidays so karuna 's 16 years old in my book she 's a teenage mum but there are a lot of kids who are younger like child parents you know nine years old looking after a brother 10 years old looking after a baby sister probably as we speak in lockdown so there 's a lot of fairy tale elements and and references in my book and this interviewer said ah did the fairy tales come from your upbringing because you probably you know when i was growing up and looking after babies uh they were the books i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that and i thought wow your reader can give you a lot of insight into your own writing that you sometimes don 't have yeah i 've been looking at photographs more recently because i 've been away from places i love and yeah and you know facebook just throws them up randomly and i kind of then see there 's something in the background i missed even if i thought i was taking it and things that have been revealed about people i thought i knew well that suddenly have a new dimension to it which i which has just been you know so touching and so moving too is there an element of that that happens with books too you think that i think there is and i think when i wrote 100 days i deliberately made it from the 16 year old girl 's perspective because i wanted to show the world through her eyes um and so this book is quite divisive it 's been my most divisive book so there are some people who who read it and can really identify and my friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's also a writer herself said to me you can feel the thick love pouring out of karuna 's mother for her daughter and then there are some people who um say what is this book this isn 't a book about love it 's misleading the blurb says it 's about love but let it be clear there 's no love in this book it 's completely about abuse you know no nothing um culturally excuses that kind of abuse i was like wow that 's so fascinating do you expect that you 're going to arouse this kind of divisiveness or oh well i didn 't set out to write a controversial book because once you do that then your characters fall flat i just wanted to write a human book about growing up in an area that a lot of writers are not familiar with because writing essentially from my experience is quite a middle-class profession a lot of the time you need the time you need the resources you need you know you need maybe if your mom you need to pay people to babysit your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stories are the ones we read about and uh my my friend emma emily maguire who 's also a very literary but very working class writer sent me a quote recently um from an author named grace paley which i 'd like to share because you know it really i thought this this speaks to the heart of writing about places like braybrook so grace paley said every story can be about anything you want but in essence it must contain two elements it must contain blood and it must contain money and what she means by that is money in that there are certain economic arrangements that make it possible for people to exist in the world so we can 't ignore that and blood in terms of kin there are certain relationships that you have with people who are your blood that you can 't ignore in a story as well that make who your characters are and much literature a lot of the time shies away from talking about you know money or about blood yeah tell us about the kinship relationships in your book to to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about blood and money oh okay so there 's these relationships and and how they work and what what the what the atmospherics are like in the relationship and in the in the confinement something in the book that the anxious inadequate love yeah so it 's about a mom who is quite flawed um who has a a daughter so the mum comes from the philippines and marries an anglo-australian man has happened a lot um back then and she comes to australia and the marriage doesn 't work out so all she has is this one daughter named karuna and she controls every aspect of karina 's life and she also shares the same bed as her daughter because she 's lonely and she 's depressed and she 's got no one in the world because she doesn 't have a husband anymore um some of it is based on uh true things you know one of my best friends shared the same bed as her single mum until she was about 25 so corona is in this very stifling relationship with her mother who controls everything what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the australian government has these ads you know about is is the person you love controlling you are they taking control of all your finances are they dictating what you wear where you go what you eat you know if so this is a bad relationship so it 's talking about domestic abuse but what happens if it 's a parent-child relationship now i understand if your child is six years old or eight years old you 're the adult you should make decisions about what they eat because they 'll eat lollies all the time what happens when they 're on the cusp of adulthood like what what happens if they 're 17 and just 365 days later their adult where 's the difference between you know reading abuse into that and love so that 's what the book is about yep and and and when did it dawn on you that you needed to start the book there in that kind of bed as you say this woman young woman who 's about to to be a mother herself in in not too distant future with with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment we went that needs to be the opening shot the opening scene oh because it was so oppressive bruno and i thought well this teenager 's pregnant how are you meant to hide a pregnancy from your mom if you share the same bed as her at well it 's an admixture of teenage naivety and also um absolute uh defiance i think and this is the the um the unspoken reality is that some teenagers get pregnant not on purpose but not completely by accident either so i 've been i 've done workshops of teenagers who you know think wow in this year level there are seven teenage mums i wonder why and it 's because they see their friend get pregnant and they 're like oh this this girl is treated like an adult now people pay her respect people care about her body and people feed her good things you know so yeah so it 's it 's about that too um in certain sorry you go bruno just it 's a reality in certain poor suburbs in australia there 's a lot of teen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunities to make their own decisions you don 't set yourself have to be a polemical writer or a political writer and you 've often said if you do that the story is going to kind of collapse on you isn 't it and i totally understand that in that argument but but there 's no doubt that you are trying to take us into a whole world in which we who read in the middle class don 't experience or don 't enter what what how difficult is it to usher us into that world and say stay long enough and and nothing momentous is kind of happening at some levels too although the coming of the child is is of course hugely momentous oh bruno it 's it 's a very claustrophobic book because there 's only two settings the 14th floor of this housing commission flat where she lives with her mum and also um the hairdressing salon that her mum makes her work at before she gets too pregnant because she 's she 's dropped out of school essentially and there are only five main characters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three times as hard as a book with many more characters so it 's a real character-based book and alice to to limit that when you could in a sense you know kind of have a multiplicity of characters and and have that are you not kind of claustrophobic in the sense your own writing limits well well bruno i 'm just writing the re i hope um it 's it 's reflective of the reality that some teenagers live if they have really controlling parents their world is essentially limited to five or six people if they 're not in school and i 've seen this experienced by some of my cousins and you know some of my school friends so that they school was where they saw the most people then they went home and their families their parents didn 't have any external friends especially if they were somewhat religious especially if they were somewhat suspicious of outsiders so a lot of young people only have five or six people in their lives that 's just the way it is your central character who who also knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ referring to the grandma of the child to be how does karuna deal with that and what what are her strengths to enable her to to not be totally crushed from there i 'm glad you mentioned the narrator and the narrative device bruno because the book is about karuna writing to her unborn child so her mother makes her a deal and this was quite common when i grew up mothers would say to their pregnant teenage daughters look fine you have this baby and we won 't adopt it out as long as you become the baby 's sister and i raise it as my own and it was the mother saying to the child you know you 're 16 you can still go back to school you can have a life and the mom taking on the burden of raising another kid at 45 or 43 or however old the mum is you know um so it was an act of great love but to a 16 year old who has nothing of her own it 's it 's a theft you know she 's so angry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unborn child like this is what 's happening to me their co-conspirators her and her child um or she hopes they will be when when the baby is born is that an example of the thick love to quote your your your friend 's kind of phrase there is the the the mother 's willingness to take this on i think so and my friend um is it 's interesting she um has also written a book called things nobody knows but me about her mother who had severe bipolar and you know gave up a child for adoption at 16 and so amra could understand that a very damaged parent still is able to love a child in the best way they can yeah i don 't think i 've encountered a story that 's dealt with characters of that sort of alice and that 's why it 's a it 's an impressive book and a you know and i felt you know that i live deeply in your book because as i 've said many times which i think is the great compliment to you storytellers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and as limited as claustrophobic as lacking in action of the hollywood nature to be able to hold this there are you are you are you conscious as your writing of what you 're asking the reader to do or or is that something you would you don 't need to think about and you just let it take care of itself oh it took care of itself actually last year bruno because everyone was locked up for a hundred days so when they come to this book i thought wow people are going to have levels of understanding about this book that were non-existent before everyone got locked up and limited their own lives to five people you know people are telling you that in their responses to your book are they going covert made me read 100 days really differently um finer kind of consciousness of something um not really the people who still think the relationship is abusive still believe that and the people who think that it do you know what i mean yeah but that 's a that 's an interesting point i don 't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't read any of your reviews either i just love reading your book and having the chat yeah alice tell us about um how she gets pregnant and and the young man who who is there for a little bit and we 've talked before about the absence of men i mean her father 's in the story in the early bits but tell us about how she gets pregnant and and the poetry that that young man introduces into karuna 's life and the effect that that has oh okay so corona goes to a free tutoring program at the local community center um similar to you know bray brook library has the community center attached so yeah it was for she didn 't read the poster properly it was for younger kids it was called homework help and there was another program for older six you know people doing vc so she ends up in this tutoring program but she finds that there 's a hot shooter who is 18 years old and he 's doing it out of the goodness of his heart before he goes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's he 's finished school and um that 's how she gets knocked up now the hot shooter i deliberately made um filipino just because bray brook um and areas like that are so multicultural that you know a serbian person could end up with a filipino or chinese could end up with the historical um enemy do you know what i mean but these delimitations don 't matter anymore but also there aren 't that many asian australian male um heartthrobs in literature at all so anyhow so she she ends up with him um it 's very there 's no places to go basically it 's in the back seat of their car where has she learned about those things because given the limited nature of the world she 's in and the kind of upbringing she 's had i one suspects that you know she would kind of i think i 've known very much about oh bruno i i reckon when you were a young man you wouldn 't have known very much but your hormones would have told you what to do to and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes home and she 'd read somewhere in the women 's weekly that dead old prevents pregnancy so she actually washes herself out in detail and thinks that 's it i 'm i 'm done i 'm clean you know this is a contraceptive but ray is rather a caring kind of bloke too isn 't he and as i said in in the question that he introduces poetry to it that it does kind of give her some nourishment and something to hang on to too oh yeah so there 's a box of free books you know sometimes libraries give out free books they have a box that three books take one so um he grabs a book for her and it happens to be walt whitman the great american poet from the late 19th century and the reason i chose whitman is just he seems his poetry seems um resonant to teenagers and also he he seems kind of timeless as well um yeah and that 's that 's how things work in brave rookie discover poetry from a free books pile you don 't have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reading classics yeah i i had chris and henry read a poem to me as a 30 year old then i went wow i get that and i didn 't think i ever understood poetry before that i like the way that karuna talks about whitman and i get the feeling sometimes you alice say i don 't know a lot about poetry and yet these lines i 'm about to read i think you you get it really well she goes karuna is going i kept reading the whitman this guy wrote in the same way my mind seemed to meander these days he sends his ending before his thoughts did his ideas jumping from cliffs to valleys and then skinny dipping in rivers before emerging finger and toeing up mountains the man was mad couldn 't think in straight lines but he knew about multitudes all the different sorts that is a stunning kind of description i think of what whitman does and i 've never been able to encapsulate whitman in that kind of way but that 's what puberty does as well bruno you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brain i 'm not sure if you experience that but absolutely i get that deeply your sense of self is shattered into little parts and yeah there are just some wonderful lines of whitman that um cross gender across culture so i just remember reading this great line about i am a noise i i am in a meeting sorry it 's just my son leo that 's okay [Music] yeah can you go in there please because there 's too too much noises thank you sweetman he 's just sorry everyone i 'm just homeschooling my son [Music] oh what was i saying oh yeah whitman has this wonderful line i am a noiseless patient spider and i i thought of that line when i was cutting my baby 's fingernails i thought whitman how does he know about cutting baby fingernails so i think to me poetry um resonates when it relates to life yeah and life like that life is not a linear narrative no no so you must know something about that as as a novelist that hello leonardo i can 't go back to your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multitudinousness of the of the world how how do you hold on to trying to weave a story through that kind of multitudinous that that seems to me that the great art of the writer oh how how do you weave a story well i came up with these two characters and sometimes what what i wanted to explore is sometimes you 're not fully formed as an adult before you have a child and i don 't mean you 're a teenager some people in their 20s 30s and 40s aren 't haven 't reached emotional or psychological adulthood and then they have a child and then if that child um pisses them off well from braybrook here they react in a very childish way themselves i hope that makes some sense so i wanted to explore that and um so the grandma the karuna 's mother and her are like two puzzle pieces that i did that someone accidentally two puzzles that someone accidentally dropped on the floor and they got mixed up you know they don 't know which pieces belong where but they 're madly scrambling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is being formed you know while this daughter is having a baby they 're still working it things out among themselves so that 's the struggle absolutely and i think most adults would admit to that alice i don 't think i fully grew up until i had my own kid i don 't think i fully grew up until my father died and and that was at the age of 56 i think there was a moment wow happening that i went i think i think i 've now reached genuine adulthood but that 's that 's a story for another time was more to to to bolster your you what you said about going we we come into things incomplete and inadequate and we we get rolling with them and we might do and we try and figure them out and sometimes we learn and immense things from it tell us about some of the side characters in in your book we haven 't kind of discussed this before mrs osmond she 's interesting because on one level she looks like she 's just the lady running her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs to do as an employee but there 's also a sick love there in a very understated way too isn 't there oh yeah mrs osmond was a a great character to make up because she 's based on a couple of real people um another one of my best friends actually went in her early 20s and opened a nail salon in the in the quite wealthy suburb of elston week and she said to me and i stole her line when i visited her she seemed so grown up she and her sister ran this nail salon she said alice you know there are ladies who are really busy and they come and they 'll talk and be nice to me and then that they 'll be happy they got manicures and leave and she said the ladies who aren 't really busy in their lives who have not much on will come in and constantly complain about how busy they are and i thought that 's so interesting um so mrs osmond is an immigrant herself of turkish background who runs this hairdressing salon that karuna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have her character in there just because grandma needed a job and had no friends so and grandma has to work numerous things doesn 't she she yeah you can 't accuse her of not putting in she just is just exhausted all the time isn 't she yeah yeah do you have that you must see women like that still in in the in the suburb when you go back do you oh yeah of course that mum who was yelling at her kid in the supermarket was probably just fed up i don 't know what was up with that but yeah she was yelling at her kid in the same way as i 've heard many moms yell at their kids um and and it was ugly it was very ugly you don 't call your kid all sorts of profanities but i i i don 't know you know it 's so interesting and that 's why i think um like my mum was constantly stressed you 're constantly stressed i 'll give you an example you know um if your kid runs onto the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give them a talking to and and tell them about road safety and stuff if you grow up and your parents are out workers and you run outside onto the road they bring you back and they smack the crap out of you and they say how if you do that again you know i 'll beat you until you 're blue and black they won 't really but they threaten you and then they go back to sewing on the sewing machine 200 pairs of jeans for the next week because they don 't have time to what we call parent uh it 's become an adjective these days isn 't it this idea of parenting yeah you feel you 've understood your own parents a little bit more deeply i know you wrote her father 's daughter and obviously you know you put the lens on your dad you know in that book but but your mother this time around and and you being a vastly different person to the person who wrote unpolished gym three kids married um human you know human tragedy in your family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the writer has changed leonardo bruno is going to tell you something leonardo hey leonardo leo listen you better go back to your school come on sorry everyone that 's okay it 's a bit tricky i 'll come and visit you soon and we 'll go for a walk and i 'll buy you a gelato okay but you 've got to go back to your school room okay okay okay okay thank you bruno for those of you in the audience who don 't bruno is also the godfather of my children so yeah they only listen to bruno thank you bruno the essence of my question you 've changed immensely but all books and all writing at some level maybe alice 's is the person holding the pain is figuring things out for themselves oh definitely yeah i don 't think i 'm right if i didn 't need to figure things out i just lived my life quite happily oh what was i trying to figure out with this one is whether whether you can um you know to what extent does love become dangerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i think that was what i was trying to figure out with this one yeah i think i know the answer to my next question but have you figured that out in a comprehensive way where you go i don 't need to interrogate that again oh no not really as a writer as a parent as a person you 're always grappling with how much control you have over your kids and how much control um you 're willing to relinquish you know and and a wise person once said to me they so you can bring up your kids however way you want uh but just beware that if you use control as a means of parenting in 10 15 years time that child is going to be smarter than you you hope stronger than you you hope and um you know have the world is theirs it 's no longer yours so you think about what your relationship is like when they 're an adult you can 't just flip that around okay my boys at 14 were already stronger than me and they could lift me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that my father 's kind of sense of control or just waving his belt was just not going to cut it with them either too or were they not scared of you no i don 't think they would i 'm kind of pleased that they weren 't that 's a good thing i think yeah yeah one of my favorite scenes in your book karuna 's in the park she 's heavily pregnant she sees this family celebrating as a family of course you know we 've already talked about the fact that you know she 's only got five people in her life and of course she sees them joyously throwing the baby up in the air and karuna in the book says how can i compete how can your grandma they 're only two of us and much of the time we don 't even like each other but here we are waiting to bomb you with our flawed anxious inadequate love tell us about how you arranged bomb flawed anxious inadequate and larval in the same sentence because my hunch would be in the whole history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever before oh thanks bruno um i i guess it stems from all the insecurity you have as a parent leo sorry i 'll just leo can you go in here hello everyone we 're just waiting for alice to come back alice is just having a little chat with leonardo daniel is her middle child oh sorry thank you i 'm just doing a little commentary on how many people oh thank you sorry homeschooling and no no stuff um you know most of us could be jumping out of the window and wouldn 't know how to answer any of my questions but thank you for stopping the inadequacies as a parent you know i grew up similar to karuna my parents were very protective we didn 't have any external friends which is why it 's important for my children to have lots of people they can talk to outside of me i don 't think i have the monopoly on wisdom and life set out to do that on the basis of your own upbringing yes yes got to build multiple islands that they can swim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and end-all everything started and ended with them um not to you know i love them to bits but that they that was what they believed that they knew they were the founders of everything or wisdom intelligence um so so you know i didn 't have much perspective up till i up till i was about 18 or 19 and then i started to realize gosh some people are parented really differently and there are huge gaps in my in you know in what i know and also emotional gaps that haven 't been filled only because one person can 't fill them all to go back to that analogy of a relationship partner if your partner controls every aspect of your life and believes that they he or she are all you need you miss many things emotionally friendship you you miss how to negotiate things you all these things you 're missing so i didn 't realize that until um i was in you know i was 18 or 19 and had some freedom was like oh i see so yeah so karuna sees his child and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that your parents are not the be all and end or and she 's to be honest she 's like dead envious of this baby who has like an extended family and friends and other people she 's like what what am i going to do i 'll just have to bond this kid with all the love i can because i don 't have any of that you know yeah and and what what what do we notice happening to karuna and and and her her sense of herself as this baby is growing and what are the things that are happening in in the book that you go irrespective of this claustrophobia and this this kind of stopping love there 's something here emerging that 's strong oh i i guess what 's emerging is a sense of identity separate to her mother and the irony she has to have a baby in order to experience his sense of separation because she gets to go to doctor 's appointments when her mother 's working so she has a relationship with the family doctor not like she has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hairdressing salon she has an independent relationship with miss osmond the lady who owns a salon independent of her mother so these are the ways that she begins to realize that there are other women who have different perspectives on um what you should do if a baby is the best example because her mother won 't let her do certain things that the baby won 't even let her eat fruit or pineapples while she 's pregnant because it will damage her spleen which is um not scientifically proven you know won 't let her eat chocolate because she 's worried her baby will have dark skin which again is superstitious whereas the doctor she sees karuna 's doctor is able to um sort these things out you know tell karuna uh that she should take vitamins and things like that yeah alice have your parents now now that you 're 40ish and three humbini and they love your kids and i know how how much they rush to them and want to be involved in their life have they ever quietly kind of nodded your way some some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more i like the way you 're doing that or oh wow the way you 're doing that has made me think about the way i did my parenting um that 's so personal my dad is good um he he 'll recognize what when i 've done something you know he he 'll encourage certain things because um that 's the way he 's always been but my mom is a lot like karuna 's mum she loves me but her love is expressed through criticism tiger mother stuff so i suppose i asked that because i i knew of that bit but i didn 't know whether something had changed in that because of your buds and how much she loves them now oh no she loves them yeah absolutely and i trust her with them um now she 's learned to use an epipen which was a bit of a struggle to get her but yeah um because one of my children is severely allergic but i did have a friend in university who also had asian parents and this is the extent of danger that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't believe in his allergy he just kept feeding him stuff that would trigger you know make his breathing worse and she said the more you expose them to it the more they 'll grow out of it and he didn 't to the point where he had epipens you know where he had anaphylactic shock um and she still um and he said oh the biggest relief was when i got control of those epipens when i was a teenager and then he felt uh that his life was not in danger so you know parents can do some crazy stuff to their kids alice i just want to move tech a little bit and talk about writing and how we prepare ourselves and and what kind of people writers are you you quote john green in your last book close to home you say writing is a profession for introverts who want to tell you a story but don 't want to make eye contact while doing it why did you feel the need to to highlight that idea do you think that 's partly you or do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know too is that element of wanting to tell and desperately wanting to communicate but also wanting to duck for cover a part of the paradox that are right is generally i think so and also introverts generally don 't get much air time because by the time you finish formulating a perfect sentence in your head an extrovert would have moved on to five topics so introverts think about what they 're going to say and i just experienced this most of my life at school and high school and university once you 've thought about what you 're going to say the extrovert has already blurted out six or seven things and everything 's moved on so i guess writing is um the sure fast way for introverts to be heard in their own time you can take a book away and read it yeah but you hold your own beautifully i 've seen you in front of you know 200 students i 've seen you give a speech impromptu on on grass i 've seen you being interviewed by me i 've seen you being thrown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are that contradiction a little bit aren 't you that that shy writer who who also knows how to not let others take away your airspace i reckon oh i think it 's two decades of experience to be honest and they say introverts make the most interesting storytellers if if you they 're given a chance because they think carefully about what they 're going to say so i i don 't know i don 't know whether that 's true and most of your friends who are writers is there that strong element of shyness in a lot of them do you think oh it 's a mixture to be honest yeah there are some extroverted authors as well some people would find that surprising but there are i i asked that question not not knowing i i just know a few and whatever william golding when he was giving his speech for his nobel prize all of maybe 30 years ago said put simply the novel stands between us and the hardening concept of statistical man there is no other medium in which we can live so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service a novel renders it performs no less an act than the rescue and the preservation of individuality and dignity of the single human being wow you think he 's right about because i think that when i 'm in your book or preparing for anyone and i 've lived there for two days and it 's almost the world that i then live in and my own physical world has kind of retreated or just just dissolved that 's what i 'm doing i 'm weaving in and out of that those characters worlds deeply and i 'm intimately knowing their innermost thoughts and i 'm in the bed with karuna and her grandmother do you think he 's right that novels can do that bit of art better than other forms oh i definitely think he 's right um because sometimes you know more about a character than the person next to you you know you don 't know what your best friend is thinking you don 't know what your mother 's thinking or your brother or your uncle and some characters you know exactly what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out for you um and once you know what a person is thinking it 's just too hard to see them uh in a two-dimensional way anymore as all those bogans from bray brook or you know those asians who are here to steal our jobs it 's you can 't do that anymore but only only certain people are prepared to go with that aren 't they alice otherwise we wouldn 't have political discussions that are so kind of you know encrypted in in tribal kind of simplicities and things like that wouldn 't we because if we live long enough with with whichever character we we we have to change our assumptions don 't we that 's so true bruno yeah and i think one of the most challenge our assumptions even though you go i don 't explicitly set out to be didactic i don 't explicitly no i don 't one of the most um saddest assumptions we all make is that certain class or a certain group of people are stupid and you can 't get through them they 're thick they 're uneducated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she she came from absolute poverty in the philippines so she can 't read and write she barely speaks english she can 't even read um food labels so she could mistake detergent for hair conditioner or something she 's deeply superstitious all these ills that we consider a reflection of a terrible person and a terrible mother she believes in beauty pageants but because when you read this book you 're opened up to her world and you understand that beauty pageants were the only way to get out of abject poverty in the philippines that and basketball that her illiteracy stems from absolute poverty and that her absolute love for her child means that she has to impose these superstitions you don 't think of that person as a stupid anymore you think gosh this this is a complicated person yeah and that 's doing exactly what william golden is saying in that quote isn 't it yeah i suppose so yeah listen alice um i hate to do this to you but we have to wind up in a minute so i 'm just going to finish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poet bislava zimborska who run it won a nobel prize for poetry was once asked why she only had a limited amount not a limited but she had x number of poems and the implication was why hadn 't you written x plus x plus x and she said i have a waste paper basket tell us about the relationship with your waste paper basket how much do we need to fling away before we get the bits that we need oh um it 's it 's not that physical anymore you know because a lot of our work is done on computer but much um i don 't know when writing 100 days maybe half of the book was gone uh or was redrafted or was in a different form or another some ca i don 't even think characters disappear because i had so few to begin with um subplots disappeared things like that uh the gender of the child changed so quite a lot changes from the beginning to the end of the book and i suppose that the subtext that question was do you and i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyway do you have a sense of this is my body of work i don 't even know that i think that most writers would think about how much have i written and is it a significant amount and will it last you you 're not dead not really bruno to be honest just because i and i understand why some writers do that like if you 're writing game of thrones you know you are creating a body of work and you know it has to conclude at some point but each book is different and each book is to work something out so you know you never think oh is it do i have enough children is do these children constitute my body of work and i guess each book is so distinct and each writing process is so different that i can 't think of a body of work not really and your publishers do they now go alice we haven 't heard from you for a while or or you will you know your audience will magically kind of disappear if you don 't you i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oh i don 't i 'm very lucky bruno that black ink allow me to take as long as i need on each book so this one took about four years to write and they never rushed me um and i never presented a for i never told them what it was about until i had a complete draft because i didn 't want to be rushed into anything so that 's how i work yeah it sounds like a lovely relationship of trust and yet we get the impression sometimes publishing is a brutal word but to be to be allowed to do it in your own time and it 's a great compliment isn 't it yeah it 's a wonderful small publisher so they they want you to create something as best as you can before you bring it out into the world because a lot of um big commercial publishers try and rush use because of topical issues or whatever whatever it is but yeah it 's been a joy again alice and i know you 've done it under great kind of so sorry we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thanks so much fiona for your lovely comment about the kids fiona williams just said please don 't apologize all part of knockdown [Music] it 's great to have you back and thank you for the

    "text": "welcome to the city of barabadong 's digital biodiversity clips and in this clip we 'll be showcasing the amazing biodiversity which calls the marabong river home beginning on the slopes of mount macedon the marathon river flows directly into the yarra river this majestic river has played a major role in the development of colonial western victoria today the meribenon river is the lifeblood of the city of maribyrnong as our world becomes more urbanized it has never been more important to address the negative impact people have on the natural world starting with our local environment a healthy maribyrnong river its tributaries and wetlands are vital for the continued prosperity and health of people and wildlife maradona 's waterways act as environmental corridors for biodiversity and ultimately contribute directly to the health of people too our impact on the land and the city of maribyrnong has far-reaching effects on the broader environment as well as directly impacting on our families and our own health remember every creek every stream in the city of maryland flows into the mirabelong river and the miravalon river flows directly into port phillip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wildlife of all types call the marabong river home our beautiful river affords a multitude of different habitats and environments for animals to live from the far upstream reaches to the wide river red gum line banks to the downstream brackish title changing environment flowing into port phillip bay amazingly dolphins seals and even little penguins are sometimes seen frolicking up and down a river in the city of maribyrnong let 's discover up close and personal some wildly diverse local creatures which surprisingly live on our very own back doorstep and let 's discover ways which we can help proliferate these creatures and look after them this is an eastern long-necked turtle celadina longa colas a turtle with a long neck and he 's fallen victim to plastics in our waterways without assistance this turtle would surely die now the difference between turtles and tortoises is that turtles are aquatic and have feet for swimming and tortoises are terrestrial and they live on the land they have walking feet these are called side neck turtles they can bring their heads into their bodies and whack out and grab their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're carnivorous see his nose right up there it 's not on the front of his face his schnoz is on top of his head so he can use his nose like a snorkel sticking his nose out of the water and creeping up on his prey and avoiding being detected by his predecessors he 's got a piece of skin over his ear it 's called a tympanum when he 's swimming beneath the water he doesn 't get water in his ear canals ingenious now the top part of his shell is called his carapace great protection no bills no rent he 's always on the holidays and underneath they 're his ribs and his sternum stuck together that 's called his plastron now check out his coloration black and yellow means warning stay away that 's a great defense mechanism from predators and these turtles are well known for exuding a pungent odour out of their backside their cloaker boy it stinks so much you 'd have to put a pang on your nose but definitely tells predators to leave them alone now you might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead fish they 're like a environmental filter without turtles there would be algae blooms and the river would become deoxygenated put your litter in the bin and look after our eastern longneck turtles they do a great job for us they keep the river clean when you 're protecting biodiversity you can 't just save the fluffy the cute and the endearing you also have to save the short thin deals have you ever heard of the expression slippery as an eel well they 're not wrong this is one slippery little sucker and this is the fish not a snake these are voracious predators nocturnal in nature hunting yabbies insects worms and fish and you can see their nodules on the front of their head for feeling around sensing for prey but of course as they 're growing up they 're an important food source for other predators look at their paddle-like tail for propelling themselves through the water it 's like one enormous flipper these are highly prized eating fish baby short fin deals are called elves they can absorb 50 of their oxygen requirements through their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to climb out of the water and slither along the wet surface of the land finding new environments these animals have a most incredible life cycle short fin deals swim into port phillip bay out through the heads and up to the coral sea 5000 kilometers away just north of new caledonia that is incredible when they breed they die now the babies the larvae swim down the current of the east coast of australia and make their way back to the top of the marabong river and find a new habitat to live in so it 's like going back to the family home the maribyrnong river is a very important part of the short finned eels life cycle so it 's up to all of us to keep our wetlands and the maravadon river cleaner pollution and waste so clean up our waste don 't litter don 't put anything down our storm water and protect the environment of the short thinned eel i love you short fin deals meet a freshwater crayfish often called a yabby it 's found in many wetlands and waterways in the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pairs of antennae and five pairs of legs scary looking but it 's a creature vital for water quality ecosystem health and a food source for many animals yabbies are known to semi-hibernate over the winter time they 've got an amazing adaptation to survive droughts they burrow into the mud and they can remain there for up to two to three years without having to eat that 's incredible and in the wet season they can move around on the land finding new water bodies to live in finally let 's discuss penguins in the city of marabadong 's waterways what i hear you say penguins amazingly the answer is yes a colony of little penguins call melbourne home and yep you guessed it little penguins have been known to swim up the marabong river on high tides in the search for fish i 've even seen them myself this is eudita lamina a little penguin eudiptylomina means great little diver there are 18 different species of penguins found worldwide and this is the smallest they 're blue on top so predators from above can 't see them and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see them as they 're swimming in the ocean fairy penguins spin up to 80 of their lives at sea dozing and swimming on the ocean waves they eat up to 25 percent of their body weight a day that 's a huge appetite they have salt glands above their eyes which they exude the salt from the ocean water which they ingest that 's ingenious hey what are you doing their wings aren 't adapted for flying they 're adapted for swimming through the ocean they 're exceptional swimmers they don 't fly through the air they fly through the water they can dive down to 20 meters chasing anchovies pilchards and squid and that 's a problem our waste our pollution washes down our storm water drains into the maribyron river and out into port phillip bay that 's where little penguins live and our plastic waste also entraps and ensnares our beautiful penguins discarded fishing line is a death trap for a penguin we need to look after these guys so please be responsible with the plastics put it in the bin recycle plastics and don 't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our little penguins [Applause] so come on join me in enjoying protecting and understanding the amazing creatures which live in the mirabenon city council 's wildlife rich waterways love where you live in the city of [Music] marabonal [Music] [Applause] [Music] you"

    "text": "welcome to the city of maribyrnong 's biodiversity digital workshops in this clip we 'll be exploring the incredible wetland ecosystems which are bound in the city of marabadon and the amazing variety of bird life which inhabits them and you 'll be absolutely blown away by the diversity and beauty of the bird life which lives on our very own backdoor step bird watching is a fascinating pastime and when you take the time to watch and observe it 's so rewarding to be able to understand each different species adaptations behaviours and ecological niche after all every animal has a job to do the wetlands in which these birds live are also vital for a healthy natural environment for us not only do these ecosystems reduce the impact of floods they absorb pollutants and improve overall water quality which directly helps improve all of our lives too sadly our native birds face many perils and it 's up to everyone to protect our beautiful feathered friends so when enjoying our open spaces spare a thought for our native wildlife after all they were here first let 's meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best places to go bird watching in the city of maribyrnong is at newell 's paddock conservation reserve where over a whopping 117 different bird species have been observed meet the regal australian black swan the only black colored swan in the world a large majestic aquatic bird still found in the city of maribyrnong 's wetlands and waterways the biggest threat to the black swan is being attacked by dogs off leeds so do the right thing and help protect these beautiful birds by keeping your dog on its lead another issue is well intending people feeding them human foods like bread human foods like this don 't have the nutritional value these birds need and cause potential harm so please refrain because it 's important for the health of our birds to let them eat their natural diet of aquatic vegetation this is an australian wood duck commonly called a mained goose they are one of my favorite duck species the scientific name is chenonetta jubata chenanesa means dislike duck and jubata means mained and they 're called dabbling ducks the male wood duck has the brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neck i reckon it looks like a mohawk and it makes him look rather dapper that 's to impress his lady friends all ducks are the winner in australian wildlife they have proliferated with agriculture and urban parklands you know what they like to eat grass they dabble around pick up bits of grass and eat up all the seeds and poop them out what a great job they 're kind of like an environmental engineer they 're like gardeners this beautiful duck species lays eggs in hollow logs ah ah wood ducklings adorable slow down and watch for wood duck families crossing our busy roads in the city of maribyrnong this is a white ibis often called the bin chicken this unfortunate nickname has given them a bad reputation for being scavengers but they should be applauded for their adaptive and resilient ways their long curved beak is used for spearing and snatching insects worms and frogs for dinner remember these unusual looking birds help us out by eating up all of the bugs hey there 's some chestnut teals amazingly they 're one of the few australian ducks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the male apart from the female because he sports the brighter plumage this is a buff breasted rail they are a very secretive bird a wetland bird and not often seen they like to hide in secluded areas in bulrushes and tall reeds rails are more common than you might expect they are beautiful creatures opportunistic hunters and the interesting thing about this bird is when the chicks hatch the babies are highly independent and can run around and fosic for food pretty much immediately look at their long legs for walking through the muddy wetlands they 're like a pair of stilts it has an amazing tapestry of colours for awesome camouflage in its wetland environment they feed very early in the morning and late in the evening they 're omnivorous they 'll eat plant matter and meat insects and tadpoles and small fish its beak is like a pair of chopsticks for grabbing its insect prey this beautiful bird species is directly impacted upon by our litter and waste they eat our litter like cigarette butts and polystyrene and when they eat our waste they can die this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure we use our bins properly in the city of maribyrnong even at home it 's important that you don 't overfill your bin and that you keep your lids closed our birds will thank you wow this is the dusky moorhen a prehistoric looking bird that appears to defy gravity and even walks on water often confused with dusky moorhens is the eurasian coot a herbivorous plant-eating bird and a common sight in our wetlands in the city of maribyrnong check out the little pied corent drying its wings in the sun these diving birds are commonly seen along the maribyrnong river aren 't they awesome this is the majestic great egret their super long legs assist them to wade in the water in search of their prey they feed in shallow waters skillfully standing and waiting for fish frogs and insects their long sharp beak is a perfect tool for spearing and capturing their prey let 's all protect our wetland bird life together and here are some simple things that we can all do remember always walk your pet dog on a lead dogs and wildlife do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you didn 't put it there keep your cats indoors day and night cats are one of the prime killers of native wildlife remember look and appreciate our wildlife but don 't feed or disturb our native animals slow down on our busy roads and watch out for wandering wildlife so what are you waiting for start exploring the city of marabadon 's open spaces and wetlands today you 'll be blown away by what lives here love where you live in the city of [Music] maribyrnong [Music] you"

the top of your screen we 'll do our best to get to them peruse perciani is a writer a journalist scholar cultural advocate and a filmmaker who through his work brought to you the attention of the world to the plight of refugees but also he brought to our attention the power of music song poetry and stories bruno netieri is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interviews and work bruno reminds us of the importance and the power of sharing the story thank you peruse hello can you see me now hear me all right yes i can hear you so it 's over to you and peruse bruno feroz how are you i 'm good thanks yeah truly yeah i met you about a year ago and um janet galbraith and i were on the panel and now i can see your face and you couldn 't see my face yeah yeah i think last year you saw my face too i could see your face on the big beautiful screen at the end of the australian story last night we all watched and there you were cycling around a beautiful parkland in christchurch and you had your warm coat on it was a lovely scene it heartened all of us in the program you said this is freedom from me riding a bike walking in the street of the city yeah i think that is yeah that is my understanding of life and freedom that life is this just simple thing and you enjoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy when they see they watch australian story or when i arrive in new zealand i think it 's because they have been following my journey for such a long time and many of those people have been a part of my team and my journey and actually they have they feel that they are a part of this story and that 's why when i got [Music] freedom in new zealand and now i think people feel happy because they are a part of this story and i think that is very important that we recognize that we acknowledge that that many people in australia um around the world they feel happy because they this story is important for them and i think that is the connection yeah primo levy the italian poet says in each the trace of each we belong to each other we have bits of each other in all of us as a poet you feel that strongly yeah i have been uh thinking about uh belonging and what his belonging belonging means not only in when i was in manus island and not know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my life yeah and i think that relate to identity and the concept of identity it 's very important and had the big role and important uh impact on my life and my thinking because i born as a court i born as a minority and just if i say if i give you an example when i was six seven years old i went to a school and for the first time i found out that i have to talk with my teacher and i have to speak in the school with a different language a language that i didn 't know and uh of course identity is very important uh concept for all of the courts and minorities for everyone but for kurdish people especially in iran is important and so i have been thinking about identity and that 's why is a part of actually a key part of my works is about identity yeah so now that i 'm in new zealand yeah i should still am struggling with different kind of uh difficulties so we can 't talk about that sure you have your kurdish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to us maybe your third or even fourth language that must complicate that that sense of identity you 're talking about does it yeah definitely but it 's not only about language it 's not only about language so language is beautiful uh even the system the education system force you to learn that language and when you learn it you find it beautiful so i don 't want to politicize the languages all of the languages are beautiful but the identity that i talk about this so in iran i face the identity you know with how the system marginalized the kurdish people how they try to they the system designed to take our identity and uh assimilate us and so when i left iran and exactly i left iran because of my cultural activities so when i left iran uh so they exiled me to manus island so i became a refugee so when you become a refugee suddenly immediately you lose many things and you lose your identity under the concept of refugee when they someone call you a refugee you lose many things and that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this to get my identity back in front of the system there and later in the public because when i was in iran of course i was a normal person like others i had my career i had family you know but now that this story finished it seemed that finished i have another challenge with my identity which is a picture that created by the media by the mainstream media so i should struggle to challenge this imagination of me as a person just at the end of australian story you are reading a beautiful piece that you have written and and arnold sable 's voice merges with yours and you say peruse i feel deeply that i belong to the earth i belong to nature and i believe in solid ground i think we are human and don 't have any shelter but humanity has this been a lifetime 's work as a poet as a journalist as a political activist to understand that yeah i think it is very interesting so this piece has a story so when i was in manus island i had i was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letters and uh we published i think three conversation in the age newspaper and we published this there so that written to my experience in manus island uh after the riot in manus island they relocated us on that night to on the ground a soccer ground so we were there so when i look at the prison the camp i look at it and it was incredible just i imagine that now we are in a remote island and even we are not a part of the island we are in a prison on the remote island and even they take the prison from us because of the riot they relocated us to on a soccer ground then i was looking at the sky and actually honestly it was a deep feeling that where we should go we now have a place on this earth even they don 't let us to have a peace on inside the prison and they take it from us so but later when i so uh through my experience i work with many people and then i say i wrote this that i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth and we belong to each other so that came from that experience which is i think yeah i hope that i never feel like that again that i look at the sky and think that we now have a place even a small place on the earth so we should go find a place you can you finish that quote with i belong to humans beyond the political borders i am a free man beyond borders it 's an extraordinary concept beiru 's isn 't it because here we are as australians terribly worried about our borders and we 've created the prison that we put you in because of the so-called fearfulness of our borders and yet you say i want to live beyond borders it 's an extraordinary kind of counter poetic claim isn 't it tell us about living beyond borders yeah i think uh that uh that is uh i feel that uh it is a philosophy of my works because i passed many borders and i was born in the border so i was born in the village in west of iran and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that created by the [Music] powers on the first world war and that 's why we always think about border but i think i mean when i say border i mean mostly uh the border between the people and humanity and human being and that 's why so i 'm not an idealist person i don 't feel that of course i i know that this world created by the political borders and so everywhere we go we should show passport and this what i mean what i mean is that we human we feel each other and now that i 'm talking with you i wrote a piece for the saturday paper hopefully that they publish it this month that i talk about these two that how when i was in manus island i was i created a connection through the moon so there were some people from indonesia australia and manusa noro in the same time they were looking at the moon who feel each other to send a message to each other and feel each other beyond the borders so when i 'm say that i mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is the reality of our world that is reality of our world but what is happening now is division or separation between the hearts that people really don 't feel each other and don 't see each other that is the problem now is the intention of your writing and your and your book and your filmmaking and your poetry is it is it to get people back to being able to to to speak heart to heart to feel heart to heart yeah exactly and that 's why i think in my works for example in manus island especially in my journalism works i was thinking about the indigenous people there because it is a part of this system this colonial mentality that they talk in the media in a way that local people don 't exist and that island is belong to no one but that island is belong to many people that island has a history and many and a community live there so that 's why i think on base of this philosophy i had i think my perspective was bigger and that 's why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could see the local people there are suffering because of this policy and how the security companies are using that island how the australian government is using that island and even png government so that 's why i think on base of this philosophy you can 't see you are able to see more things not only yourself so in man asylum yeah so pepe ruiz you are in prison you are you are on the lowest level of this this hierarchical system you are the most oppressed and yet through your writing you have this capacity to see not only the system that is oppressing you but also the view of the minutian people and and their place in their own island that is an extraordinary thing does that come from the training of being a journalist the writer or a poet or no that 's not something that this no that actually from journalism and doesn 't come from uh the education system that doesn 't come from writing or this i think that if we accept that so it 's possible many people don 't agree with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge that created in a land such as kurdistan so kurdish people have been struggling against colonialist system for at least 100 years so 100 years fighting it 's mean that 100 years culturally fighting politically and that means that the kurdish people created a resistant knowledge through their history so this knowledge actually created people in kurdistan that when they want to challenge a system they they want to challenge it fundamentally so i borrow this culture and i borrow it and i reproduce it in manus island so in kurdish resistance has two elements i think i should explain this tell us yes yeah yeah first that the kurdish people i mean a part of the court is just on resistance knowledge that we never i mean the kurdish people the courts never uh want to become or stay in a victim position yeah our resistance always challenge this concept victim we always challenge this and the second thing is that the kurdish culture resistance cultural knowledge is says that they want to challenge the whole system so i borrowed this in manus island and if you look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible and many people when they hear my name they look at me as a victim but my words represent me if people go and read my words they can see that i challenge victim concepts and the second thing i didn 't fight i didn 't write to make the camp a better place i wanted to break this policy i wanted to challenge the whole system that 's why six years ago when i was i started my journey in manuscript i 'm in my struggle i was thinking about this to challenge that system do you think yes you have succeeded in that challenge and how do you measure that how do you know that i think it 's very difficult because uh you know this work and it 's not only my work you know i should say that i mean the refugees in manus island and now if you look at the refugees in the australia that they were transferred from manos island to australia just yesterday the story published in guardian i wrote about those musicians in the camp so if you look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culture that created by the refugees in manus island now exist in australia the tensions and the refugees speak out they challenge the system you know i think that is very important that is a uh like a lesson to australian society that how these refugees have been challenging this system through their resistance you know and i am only one of them when i came to new zealand i was on a street let me talk like a writer telling a story i was walking in the street and someone came to me and say that are you that guy who was on the tv and i said yes and he wanted to give me two hundred dollars really yeah and so i could understand that man because he didn 't have idea you know he was a typical newslander guy he didn 't have idea so then i said oh yes so you should uh you know just i was laughing at him and just i tried to educate him in two sentences later i met a woman on the street and she approached me and said oberuz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your book you are these these this and then she wanted to donate me uh what i want to say that how is difficult to challenge this narrative even so the first person so she didn 't have idea is fine the second one she read my words she watched my movie she read my book she listened to my interviews and all of this still she wanted to donate so what i want to say is that how is difficult to challenge this narrative towards the refugees how is difficult to challenge people imagination about refugees refugees are people with different background different religion different nationalities different culture but everyone wants to just put categorize them and look at them as a victim one of your people but the refugees don 't want to be victim i understand that really well when i spoke to you yesterday you talked a lot about that beirut you said people either and and you said the media essentially in in the west says you are hero or you are victim and i sense the batteries you want to say i am not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also feel that i want to speak on behalf of this is not my personal story is that true yeah i think i 'm really sorry that i talk about my story uh actually i 'm very tired of this story so that 's why i 'm doing something else yeah but of course i was in that island for six years and still i am doing some projects so i cannot get away from that experience and also i have responsibility towards those six years that 's why i should talk [Music] the media the people who know me they think i think they know that i always challenge the language of the mainstream media that how i always challenge them challenge their language because they follow the language of the power structure so i always challenge that through my works but they so regarding my story they always have this desire to reduce my story to a personal story and it 's not a personal story if it was a personal story i would leave manus island four years ago three years ago two years ago i would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ international organization i 'm in the organization that are supporting their writers and journalists i could try at least i could try and i 'm sure i could leave long time ago so it is not a personal story and i didn 't write about myself just recently i became a subject but before that i just write about others i write about politics i write about colonialism i write about local people so why they think it is a personal story it 's not a personal story that the media always try to reduce it and also they reduce my work and this long struggle to writing a book sometimes i want to really i don 't have my book here to take the book yeah yeah and take a lighter and burn it really in front of the camera really yeah yeah because in my perspective i think if i have uh if someone asked me that 's this question that which work is important for you i think the first thing is my journalism works uh at least 100 articles opinion articles and you can 't read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book and read them you see the history of that exalt policy that i look at this policy in different aspects they are not report they are they are opening articles the movie choka placed last time people in australia many people know this movie but many people don 't know it and that is a i think it is a good word and this book actually is not it 's not my only work yeah um tell us yeah i don 't know yeah just this i mean i mean the media always try to reduce it yeah when they reduce it to a book it means they deny six years fighting and i should say it again it is not a personal story it 's not my story my story is only one of many stories and many stories like me now are in detention in australia beside you close to you close to close to this library that now we are talking to in australia in port busby in naru you know so but of course i understand why many people become happy by by that last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work is trying to say you as an australian living there should be horrified should be doing something should be resisting definitely yeah you know always when i talk i always say that i 'm really sorry that i have some anger in my voice i have anger in my works and this anger make people of australia feel uncomfortable but i 'm not here to feel you make you feel comfortable absolutely i i agree you yeah to make people feel uncomfortable to think to think that why in that country you know after they keep people in detention for seven years and there is not a system that you challenge them at court the court system completely failed there are there is a person in australia who is in detention for 11 years 11 years you know we should think about this but i understand it 's really difficult australia is a very complex country it is the role of of all writing and poetry and journalism essentially to to try and move people towards some kind of political action necessarily yeah definitely it 's not about awareness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or someone else let 's do this project let 's do this interview to make people aware of this awareness is not enough now australian people most of people at least should hear something from manus you know people should hear people are aware we need understanding we need people try to understand this tragedy we need to people analyze this then do action but that 's the point isn 't it we know we cannot i am a father of grown men a a prime minister in australia in 10 years will say sorry and we will say we were there we knew what was happening in manus we knew what the situation was we cannot turn our eyes away from this that is a question that is a question really but uh what i believe that is a big question that australian people should ask and think about it why creating change in that country is difficult i never forget that that time when i watch abc program q a on that time that there was a black live matters movement yes they invited some [Music] aboriginal actors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were aboriginal and they were actor and activists it was so difficult when i saw that uh the actor i forgot her name she was very powerful she speaks powerfully she said our message is simple don 't kill us she said that and everyone in the panel everyone in the uh with the audience everyone they felt sorry but i have this question why in that country after 100 years and according to many uh aboriginal people historians more than 250 years more than 200 years after such a long time an aboriginal person should appear on tv and say our message is simple don 't kill us and when i saw that when i watched that i actually uh i was thinking that look you wrote a book and you just published some articles and some others just some people publish something about refugees and you want to challenge the narrative you want to create change in that country look at these people they have been fighting for 100 years and now their message is that simple don 't kill us a very basic message basic uh request @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creating change is difficult yet but we really should think about this i think you challenge us very very kind of wonderfully to do that why you you 're you said through your film choker please tell us the time and i think you said it in some of your articles you said the story of manus and the story of nauru and the story of the imprisonment of all those people there is now the history also of australia are we are we are we able and big enough to be able to embrace that and genuinely say it is ours and we must look at it not just be aware but we must actually do something about that yeah actually i think the another word that i should talk about it is embarrassing because when i uh you know in the events or even in new in new zealand that i met lots of australian people and also online i receive many messages letters that people say that we are sorry and we are embarrassed yeah i think we should don 't work in a way to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a way that people really understand we should help people to understand it 's that you do something wrong then you say i 'm sorry that is not enough because you repeat it so in australia you see that someone like kevin rod you know just look at him you know and politicians like him that they started this or before that john howard all of these people you know look at them they are repeating the history they are they repeat the history in different on different group of people you know just i think what i want to say just we should help people to really understand yeah understand but just i think i should mention this yeah i 'm sorry just mention this that uh i i should mention uh that for creating change i think we should create uh to i we should challenge it through cultural activities and through writing through art you know recently i talk so i hear that you so you know tara june winch the australian aboriginal writer i think when i look at her work that she actually challenged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think that really it 's very important when we look at her work even when i look at her work i think about kurdistan too that how we should use literature art to actually educate the new generation to challenge it we should create our language create our concept um right now you are doing that right now aren 't you this interview is is is a challenge we are trying to give voice to that i sense that you feel that that 's quite not enough or not strong enough or not powerful enough no no i don 't feel that i feel that i am uh just i 'm a man you know uh so uh uh i think it 's not enough one person two person ten books twenty books i mean uh creating this way is important absolutely you know creating this way when i look at my works actually i don 't look at my words i look at the the way the way that i and other refugees in manuscript we created this way and that 's why i received many messages from refugees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about my story i am going you know i mean that is impact that makes me feel hopeful absolutely yeah because we are creating our knowledge you are creating our uh language and knowledge we have we have some questions from the audience yes actually there 's a lot on our um q a panel that are in support of everything that you have just been saying and they find that it 's very powerful of you to be sitting there and challenging us and all the messages are yes we need to be challenged and yes it 's uncomfortable but we need to address this and we need to acknowledge it and they 're all very thankful and supportive of you um i am challenging myself to yes yes i have a message from someone called um azimi who um is sends a message to you peru saying i 'm so happy for you to be a free man after years in prison i was in indonesia for six years and resettled here in australia late last year and he said was his regards to you thank you and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times for ruse is people would like to know what poets and writers um you admire uh i admire i said i said that tara [Music] actually of course there are lots of writers but uh just recently i am reading short stories by the writers from source america i like them and someone like uh cortaza someone like uh rolf for marquez it 's just i 'm reading those books but of course uh there are some writers that i really like them but in he if i talk about the iranian literature i like [Music] abbas marufi i think his works are very powerful in kurdistan if i talk i talk about uh bhakti or ali because yeah there are a number of very good writers and poets but i myself i don 't recognize myself as a as a poet because [Music] in my perspective poverty is not someone who just writes some poetry sometimes the poet is someone who worked for uh create his or her language that even when you read the work you understand oh this uh uh this poetry is belong to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we hear some songs from someone we understand that is for that singer so i think in poetry is like these two so that 's why my poetry are quite different so just i should put my name there uh beerus bhushani say this then people say oh this is for but if we take the name i think people don 't understand don 't recognize it and that 's why i don 't know myself as a poet yeah well bruce i 've got a few people wanting to know when your next book 's coming out uh fiction or will it be um another non-fiction piece yeah no actually we are actually i didn 't have this time really to have some peace because need some because i have been busy there were lots of things happen in the media on this social media uh but uh now uh we are working on a book with uh actually the people from melbourne university uh that this book is a collection of my articles that i published in manus island but the some of them like 25 of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from australia and around the world to respond to these articles to analyze them so that is a book that we did actually just we are we will publish it next year so just we have it another one is a journal that we are working with janet galbraith and omit so this journal is a collection of uh writing and short stories and poetry which written by the refugees in indonesia in manus nauru and in australia detention so that janet galbraith [Music] through writing through francis group yeah she collected so we are going to publish this so it is the another project but i myself uh i 'm writing short stories which is fiction so i 'm not in hurry yes hopefully yeah offering next year next two years i don 't know it 's difficult to talk about literature you say that 's what i published this article i know that there 'll be a lot of people who will be anxious to get their hands on those books bruce i 've also had a few people ask me about identity you talk a lot about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ media set up your identity how do you see yourself and how would you like other people to see you just i think i just see myself as a man you know as a person yeah just like others you know and i think we should talk about the hero concept victim concept and hero victim concept i 'm not that one one question that keeps popping up is what advice do you have for us as to how we can help the situation for other people you know that refugees people who are feeling in our community that they don 't belong that are searching for identity yeah it 's really difficult question it is a question and i think i have been thinking about this and i 'm sure that you have been thinking about this it 's very difficult to create change in australia but just we should fight no no way you know so each person is not important that what you do just each person should do something everyone 's um very thankful for your words of wisdom and and the way that you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for us for you thank you yeah no many people are sending their thanks and um thanking you for being courageous and for sharing your story yeah thank you no thank you um and i 've just got one more question for you how do you see australia i don 't want to talk about my personal story but uh there is a paradoxical feeling towards australia because you know lots of people now are in front of those hotels in australia that they keep the refugees there and they are there they are standing up there some of them are playing music some of them are they are doing something now we are here you created this opportunity that i talk about this we receive many messages from people many people have been really fighting against this system and challenge it to at least get freedom for the refugees who are in detention so we have these beautiful things and that happened in that country but in other side we have a different part of australia which created this horrible unacceptable thing in manuscript and now in australia so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't know what should i say about uh that and you know if i say australian government this australian government this uh supported by at least half of the australian people it 's true yeah so uh i don 't want to be ideologies and say just australian government is mean peter dotten and scott marissa and the cabinets no that government re-elected by at least half of the australian population so i don 't know really it 's very difficult question just i can 't say one thing that i am really i cannot hide my anger as a person who see that those people who are in detention for seven years and yeah that really i think make lots of people angry and i 'm really sorry we 've you know i 'm one person you are one person everyone yeah just we are people oh you 've got a lot of support coming through for you peruse so thank you um and uh thank you for being so honest with us tonight and for taking to meet us all the way from new zealand um thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ providing such very much thank you yeah no thank you very very much really pretty we should go here you should go we should get it i 'm just going to say if anyone would like to purchase their own copy of no friend but the mountains riding from manus prison uh the sun bookshop has copies available and you can now go online and order them um also just a note to our participants an email we 'll go out with a um a short evaluation form if you could fill that in and give us some feedback we 'd really appreciate it also don 't forget we 're live on instagram and facebook so follow us and like us and that way you 'll keep in contact um keeping informed about new and exciting events just like this one and thank you both once again it 's been an

    "text": "[Music] hey I 'm Haley from the same media Adson media we provide broadcast opportunities and media learning for young Australians all the content that is made it 's in our by young people for young people thanks so much Tamara man on council for letting us use these videos to show you isolation creations hi and I 'm Rebecca from the same media learning team and in today 's isolation creation we will be taking you through the importance of editing so post-production and how sound can affect your podcast and will also show you where you can source these sounds that you might not be able to record yourself so before you begin editing we need to have a look at why we edit the most obvious reason is for length we might be assigned a certain time frame that we need to fit and our raw recordings might be too long for that secondly we edit to craft a story this applies if you 're recording a nonfiction or fiction podcast we need a clear beginning middle and end and we also want as many voices told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engage the listener this might mean thinking about what to include what to take out what we mean might need to add to our podcast we can add it to make a podcast a bit more easy to listen to we know that you 're not recording in studio so some of these techniques might need to be enhanced in post-production remember the your podcast will be shared online as streamed and downloaded so he might also edit to make certain functions be easier to search online [Music] what does quitting sound like well just like in a movie or TV sure if an audience member can notice the editing it probably isn 't quite right in podcasting you shouldn 't really be able to notice or hear the editing sounds layers music and sound effects should be added purposefully and not just for the sake of it think about how sound can be included to craft your story before you open any editing software and remember in pre-production you should be planning for audio hazards these are things to be aware of before you start recording such as wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jackets and jewelry finally editorial decisions mean a story should be balanced and you 're not just hearing one side of the story many voices should be heard you can make your post-production process a lot easier by planning effectively [Music] so we mentioned earlier that no matter what t he W that 's digital audio workstation you choose there will be some basic editing processes to follow on each software first of all become familiar with a consistent method of saving and labeling your files I like to stop the year the month and then the day and the time of the recording you 'll need to know how to import your audio from your memory card or from your desktop into the software become familiar with the timeline and be aware that you can zoom in close and zoom out further to focus on really specific parts of audio you 'll also need to know how to split audio cuz you 'll never want to use one whole track together and you 'll need to break it down into smaller pieces normalizing and levels are an important consideration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the listener to hear and if levels are too loud he can create distortion which is really not nice to listen to you might like to add backing tracks or sound effects and you 'll need to know how to balance these to be in line with any speaking or other sounds you 've included now it 's really important that some software programs such as audacity are destructive editing meaning you need to save as you go along so save appropriately when saving a project this does not save an audio file so be aware of these two differences never save off the raw file and keep saving different versions of your project as you go along and of course keep your files labeled consistently and clearly [Music] why do we include down in the podcast including sound in a podcast is super effective it creates a mode of resonance it makes the listener feel present and within the time frame of your podcast Sam can also be used to emphasize really important actions that are happening throughout your storytelling and it builds a world remember some podcasts transport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using sound to do that is really effective there are two types of sounds to consider when you 're making your podcast diegetic sounds and non-diegetic sounds diegetic sounds are sounds that exist and are consistent within the world that you have built they are happening as a story is being told can the character area then if the diegetic sound examples of diegetic sounds include grass crunching butts tweeting or a cup of tea being poured non-diegetic sounds are sounds that only the listener or audience can hear these sounds exist outside of the narrative or the world that you 've built sounds the characters katia so for example non-diegetic sounds of music soundtracks or any sound effects okay so we know how to use sound but we need to know how to source them and make sure that we credit [Music] bensound.com free music archive and purple planet music and great places to start sourcing sound you can search by genre turn a mood to reflect your chosen podcast style and all you have to do from most of these websites is a tribute the artist in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profit it is usually easier to use these free sounds but always double check how the artist would like to be credited remember you wouldn 't like it if your work was used without credit and attribution is a very easy process to do and that brings us to the end of our Hisle Asian creation series now you 're equipped to go ahead and bring that podcast idea to the world thanks to marvin on council for inviting us to share these tips with you and if you are a young person wanting to make media check out sym Joerg taught you [Music]"

an oldie but a goodie for you today we 've got julia donaldson and axel scheifer 's the gruffalo 's child the sequel to the gruffalo shall we go let 's go the gruffalo said that no gruffalo should ever set foot in the deep dark wood why not why not well because if you do the big bad mouse will be after you i met him once said the gruffalo i met him a long long time ago what does he look like tell us dad is he terribly big and terribly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember the gruffalo said and then he thought for a minute and he scratched his head the big bad mouse is terribly strong and his scaly tail is terribly long his eyes are like pools of terrible fire and his terrible whiskers are tougher than wire sure does sound scary doesn 't he one snowy night when the gruffalo snored the gruffalo 's child was feeling bored the gruffalo 's child was feeling brave so she tiptoed out of the gruffalo cave snow fell fast and the wind blew wild into the wood went the gruffalo 's child oh aha a hoe a trail in the snow who is this trail and where does it go a tail poked out of a long pile house could this be the tail of the big bad mouse what do you think out slit the creature his eyes were small and he didn 't have whiskers no none at all well you 're not the mouse not i said the snake he 's down by the lake eating gruffalo cake ah no the snow fell fast and the wind blew wild well i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's good aha oh mark 's in the snow whose are these claw marks and where do they go two eyes gleamed out of a treetop house could these be the eyes of the big bad mouse what do you think down flew the creature his tail was short and he didn 't have whiskers of any sort well you 're not the mouse to woo i 'm not but he 's somewhere nearby eating gruffalo pie oh gruffalo pie the snow fell fast and the wind blew wild well i 'm not scared said the gruffalo 's child she is very brave isn 't she aha a hoe a track in the snow whose is this track and where does it go whiskers at last and an underground house could this be the home of the big bad mouse what do you think [Applause] out slunk the creature his eyes weren 't fiery his tail wasn 't scaly his whiskers weren 't wiry well you 're not the mouse oh no not me he 's under a tree drinking gruffalo tea oh it 's all a trick said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the snow lay piled i don 't believe in a big bad mouth but here comes a little one out of his house not big not bad but a mouse at least well you 'll taste good as a midnight feast wait said the mouse before you eat there 's a friend of mine that you ought to meet if you let me hop into a hazel twig i 'll beckon my friend so bad and big the gruffalo 's child and clenched her fist the big bad mouse so he does exist the mouse hopped into the hazel tree he beckoned and said just wait and see out came the moon it was bright and round a terrible shadow fell on the ground who is this creature so big bad and strong his tail and his whiskers are terribly long his ears are enormous and over his shoulder he carries a nut as big as a boulder ah oh dear the big bad mouse yelled the gruffalo 's child the mouse jumped down from the twig and smiled aha oh prince in the snow whose are these footprints and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the footprints led to the gruffalo cave where the gruffalo 's child was a little less brave the gruffalo 's child was a bit less bored and the gruffalo snored and snored and snored the end oh i hope you enjoyed that one such a great story isn 't it all right i think let 's do a song do you know what we haven 't done in a long time is this song that goes i

stripy socks trousers and blouses and party frogs so quick quick take them all in take them all in from the lime here 's a nice one about the nut tree hey can you see that beautiful tree there have you seen nut trees out and about when you 've been on your walks maybe you 've got one in your own backyard let 's have a read of this small brown hard round the nut is lying underground now a shoot

    "text": "all right okay so the next one is abs everyone 's favorite abs let 's do it everyone in this room knows how to create you 're not a manager of your life you 're a creator of your life or you wouldn 't be in this room how do you create your life you get hungry for something don 't you who has done something in your life that once seemed difficult or impossible and now it 's part of your life who 's got something in your life in this area say i how did you do it you created it three ways number one you decided there 's something you wanted so bad that you unleashed all your desire you became obsessed with it if it was a business or a car or a relationship or a transformation in your body if there 's something you once envisioned and now it 's real it 's because you didn 't just envision it you brought so much emotion to it that now it 's in your life it was once a dream it was once a goal and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that in your life now say i you may take it for granted now hopefully not but it was once just a vision may have seemed impossible at one time so how did you do it you started with a concrete vision of what you wanted and you focused on it continuously didn 't you wherever focus goes energy flows you envisioned something you got clear about it and then you started thinking about all the reasons why you wanted it you got excited about it said this is what 's next for me now i want this you may have dreamed about it thought about it talked about it but when you focus on something continuously something magical happens you get insights don 't you you overhear a conversation you hear something you wouldn 't have heard if you didn 't have that outcome or goal that you wanted so badly who 's ever come up with something obsessed about it didn 't even know how to do it and it just happened and it came together who 's had that experience say i so why don 't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life most people have a belief about what their real potential is no matter what you tell them and that affects how much action they take and of course that affects the result and then ironically that result reinforces their belief and their belief affects it so i 'll give an example let 's say a person has unlimited potential we all agree but they take little action little results why because they have to start with a problem with their belief they don 't believe it 's really going to happen for me maybe for frank kearns because i 've got the cool hair and stuff or maybe it 's for you because you 're so driven but it 's not me maybe tony robbins because she 's a freak got these big teeth whatever their thought process is right they got this thing right but what happens is if you believe that there 's very little potential how much action you 're going to take profit little and when you take a little potential with a little action what kind of results you get lousy little results and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your belief you go see i told you this was a waste of time told you this wouldn 't work and then what happens you tap even less potential you take even less action even worse results and your belief gets even weaker and this sucker feeds on itself until you are in a downward spiral poisonous it 's poisonous and it 's self-fulfilling now what if something could happen that could come along and fill you with a sense of absolute certainty not like i believe but mean where you know in you guys case mine as well we knew because we had to because we burned the boats there was no other option we had to find the way we had we weren 't going to live that way we all did it in different ways and for different reasons but in essence that was it if you get yourself in a state of certainty that this is going to work i 'm going to find the way and if this doesn 't work i will make the way then you tap a lot more potential and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you take massive action you really believe in something you get great results when you get great results your brain goes see i told you i was a stud i told you this thing would work out now you 're even stronger you tap more potential take greater action better results that 's how you went from 300 bucks in a week to 2505 days to 100 000 in a month to a million bucks in a day same thing with you and we get momentum why the rich get richer and the poor get poorer now some people go out and they go well i 'm going to take a bunch of action all right i 'm going to open this product i 'm going to try it they 'll say to you i even did it but it 's like a salesman who goes and knocks on the door and he knocks on a hundred doors and says you don 't want one of these yeah exactly right yeah and even if he doesn 't say it verbally his face says it because he doesn 't believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the execution is so weak maybe if he talks 100 people somebody 's going to buy out of pity they don 't want his kids to starve right but he 's not going to get the result so the core difference in people is how do you produce certainty when the world isn 't giving it to you you go out you try and you try in your case you 're a hundred thousand of debt nothing 's working how do you keep yourself going the way you did it the way i did it the way you 're doing it we may not have done it consciously is we didn 't change our potential that was there and it wasn 't even taking more action taking more action with a belief it 's not gonna work it 's not gonna change anything we got results in our head that made us feel certain as if it had already happened when you 're working"

    "text": "[Music] this short film highlights maribyrnong city councils taking it to the streets event as part of the inaugural intercultural cities australasia summit 2019 exploring interculturalism through a connection to land art culture and food traditional owners that will run during rum and banarong people of the cooler nation have called maribernong home for more than 40 000 years my name is hisco i 'm an artist i paint murals yeah i think art is definitely you know one of the main main things that connects people you know especially like for me uh pictures like you know um i don 't have to say anything and you just have to like you don 't have to speak english to look at the picture and understand what what it 's trying to communicate to and i think like you know therein lies the strength of say like you know public art i 'm a migrant you know like i 'm intercultural i suppose you know like uh i speak like russian language and obviously english mongolian i 'm like a like a minority there are not many mongolians in melbourne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that way you know like i just feel like i 'm home [Music] [Music] [Music] my name is martin zacharov i 'm the mayor of the city of maribyrnong and i 'm a councillor in the area of award it 's a start of a new phase in some ways not in terms of what we 're doing because i think we 're already quite an intercultural area but it 's the difference between different cultures sharing a space and interacting and sharing their cultures it means that their culture can grow from the cultures around it obviously we have to try and get representation from a broad range of cultures in all of our functions whether that 's employees or committees or all of these types of groups so yeah diversity absolutely is is an essential part of human life and the more that we can understand it and accept it and learn from it the better off we all are [Music] i think it 's really important for us to acknowledge the first nations connection to the land that we have here in maribyrnong my name 's helen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's grade so i 've worked for over 30 years as a community development worker and a large part of my work has been working with people from migrant and refugee asylum seeker backgrounds in all the work that i do with those communities particularly young people there 's there 's one element that always comes up and that is the reverence and respect for first nations people migrants and refugees people of color people from diverse backgrounds are really committed to learning from and about the culture of aboriginal and torres strait islander people maribyrong 's a really diverse place the west is a really diverse place and we 've got a large population of people who have a fundamental commitment to first nations people and creating understanding that is really powerful my name is guk lem i 'm the councillor of the marabon city council stony greek wood i think we in marapanon we 're very very happy to have the so many culture and so many community engagement together and i think they 're very very very lucky to have that i think the more in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culture and that eliminating the the misunderstanding people come from different culture but we all the same [Music] hi my name is arya and i come across winterfest to community leadership networking i was grateful for the opportunity i get to try food that i haven 't eat before and hearing the story of each owner each restaurant we visit we get to hear their stories so that was something that i can take back to my community to share with them to you know please visit this place and they 're amazing the food 's so yummy it was really really good experience a lot of us come from elsewhere so in maribyrnong to food we can feel that we 're making a home here we can share our stories to people we can make connections with people i am rosanne and my name is abdul and he 's janice and we are from congo cafe so we were involved in the winter feast through a dinner we hosted we welcomed three groups of people to showcase ethiopian food and coffee ethiopian coffee through that coffee ceremony coffee yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come from cafe coffee so we do the coffee ceremony we tell them the story so not just drinking coffee we roasted we sit together we chat you know one of my main thing is coffee showing coffee for diversity stuff no i put sometimes ginger with a coffee also you have chat chat sometimes [Music] a lot of people on that night didn 't know about about ethiopian food but where we 're happy to try and i think sometimes it can be a daunting experience because everyone eat out of the same tray and whisk their fingers so it 's quite an experience really for someone who knows nothing about ethiopian food and i think yeah that was a success on that night i think intercultural marijuana is about creating a space where different cultures can connect and different generations can connect people with different experiences in life can connect and this is important because it 's about sharing stories it 's about sharing experiences it challenges stereotypes that we hold and it enables to see each other as neighbours as people as people have something to offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was great because we got to walk around footscray with a bunch of people we 've not met before who were all different and they 're all interested and curious about what 's happening to the new footscray and what food are we going to share tonight and what conversations are we going to share tonight and in sharing each other 's stories we got to know each other we made connections with our own food and our own stories and people were hugging each other at the end of the night it was great the intercultural cities australasia summit 2019 was held over three days in collaboration with ballarat melton and maribyno councils the city of ballarats at the australasia context on day one the city of melton held a symposium exploring intercultural practice on day two day three of the summit taking it to the streets was held in the city of maryville

this little blue bird throughout the book somebody came up with a plan what do we think their plan is going to be i think the plan is going to be to get these two together but nothing changed when

    "text": "[Music] hello everyone welcome to bray brook library as part of maribyrnong libraries for this very special occasion there 's a crowd of about 500 people here all kind of pushing their way in it 's a bit like and they they spread out onto skinner reserve as well so richard they 've really come to honor you today that 's great our special guest today of course is richard evans um ex-football player gentleman who lives in williamstown with his family has been in business and of course has written a trilogy of books and their political thrillers and it 's not a genre i know a lot about richard so i was really interested to kind of tackle this because i thought this is going to make me think a little bit differently about the questions most of my research is based on your book deceit of course the second book in the trilogy is called duplicity and the third which is coming out this year richard is called doomed doom do you like the single word titles don 't actually i i do and i did it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um and and then it went to disavow and and then when i submitted it to publishers they were knocking it back so i really thought the about the about the titles and this is what i think people think about politicians to see duplicity and i got the name of doomed when i was watching parliament one day from tony berg he was saying the turnbull government was doing this and doomed that and i thought that 's a great name i 'm going to use that and to lead on from that i suppose the question is is is politics doomed in the sense of is has has got the capability still to deliver in terms of making a real difference to to people 's lives in a really broad sense because as you say the perception from most people is that they 're in it for self-interest or if they do go in with idealism that 's going to taper off and it will get knocked out of them i guess my lessons that i 've learned about politics is that politics is all about the manipulation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manipulates the perceptions well enough gets ahead and of course it 's not only manipulating perceptions it 's also manipulating numbers and if you 've got the most numbers you win so if the government or one party wins the most numbers they get into government if the minister has the support of a lot of numbers he becomes a minister if you can do arithmetic you 'll survive absolutely fifty percent plus one um and that 's why you get a lot of discussion around about parties with doing numbers in branches and all that sort of stuff so you need to have a patron who has the numbers to get ahead in politics how did you get into politics because you left williamstown you somehow got over to the west and you you got into the seat of cowan which was the first time for a conservative member is that right correct um i left victoria to go and play football in in western australia found to my sheer disappointment that i probably wasn 't good enough so therefore i played a few games over there and got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into business and then 1990 election came up and the answer was liberal if you remember andrew peacock was spruiking about the um the answer was liberal that was the theme and when he was questioned about these things he didn 't have any answers so um the labor party won closely it was an environment um election campaign i then started complaining about it and then someone said what are you going to do about it so i got involved with politics and for a while to even get pre-selection and that that that 's unlikely isn 't it for most people to just come so lately and then be given a seat like that well i i wasn 't given i had to sort of work for it but primarily was a labor party seat and if you 're a marginal seat member the average length of stay for any member of parliament the average length of stay is six years okay so all this talk about all these politicians on pensions now you had to be on nine years to get elected but the average length of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ players never want to sit in a marginal seat and to get pre-selected what did you have to do to win the hearts of of the people who were members in order to convince them that you were the right person for the job well i had a client who was uh who was just became a senator so i went to him and i said well how do i become a member of parliament um he then told me the process gave me a choice of two seats to sort of think about and then go out and get the numbers which is what i did um and is there something in your background in business and that that had some kind of candy streak in you that knew how to win people over did you have the gift of the gab were you persuasive were you charismatic all the above bruno but uh but really what i came from a sales and marketing background most of the people i was dealing with i didn 't have a sales and marketing background they liked what i was talking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my division um i then set out a profile for the next candidate did a workshop and did a profile on with all with all the members of the of the party giving me the identity i led that knowing that what i wanted them to put up on the flip chart was me okay so i led them to describe me so you manage their perceptions correct manipulate their perceptions yeah so you were the right person for the job to get into the kind of politics the way you kind of described it i i i did that absolutely then convince all my pre-selection delegates to vote for me which they did but then someone woke up to me and said yeah you have manipulated us okay and so they try to take up take that pre-selection off before the 93 election um that 's why keating got into power wasn 't it that 's correct and houston was trying to sell a 15 um gst so i won the seat um the following three years they tried to take pre-selection off me again really even though you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a liberal party member had won the seat they tried to take it off me uh and the the next election they moved all their resources out of this out of the division and didn 't didn 't help me okay but you irrespective of what side of politics you you 're in i 'm assuming that you go in with some sense of something you really want to do some sense of some worthwhile agenda that you carry and a certain degree dose of idealism i talk about i think that 's right i mean i 'm i 'm uh socially progressive and probably economic conservative in other words um at that time we were going for a recession unemployment i think was about 11 percent interest rates were up to 14 i think residentially and i think you know i borrowed money to start my own business at 21 interest rates so i became frustrated that that the government was expected the labor government was expected to have provide all these handouts to people and i wanted to see it make a change about all that and i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make a change with indigenous affairs and i wanted to make a change in terms of um you know health breast cancer and things like that so i was able to initiate quite a few changes that 's a wide-ranging agenda isn 't it yeah including progressive agenda too including cats and and i did a speech on um on cats cats in australia the musical no no the feral cats and domestic cats so i did a speech in parliament about how we should eradicate cats out of australia because they are very dangerous to the the fauna um is this your maiden speech no no i was already in for three years um and a ranger up in the northern territory told me that the biggest cat that he 'd seen was as big as a dingo which got me into some research about this so i did a speech to say look what we need to do is control domestic cats and if we control domestic cats we can control feral cats because because you have domestic urban ferals and then you have ferals so this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new york times i was doing interviews all over the place and american tv companies said got a bit of attention uh yeah absolutely but i was pilloried for it um absolutely pilloried by people who wanted to stick the knife into me um with the irony about it the parliament is now having an investigation into federal cats in australia someone on that committee who 's investigating feral cats stuck the knife into me 20 years ago over the issue and i find that ironic really i haven 't contacted him yet to tell him that you know does the stint of six years in politics leave you battered and bruised and deeply cynical and deeply incapable of finding again some of in a way that might be to the common good there 's a couple of things to talk about in that regard in the six years i was there i had to commute from west australia to canberra and so therefore was a seven hour from my front door in in perth to my front door in canberra so but that was sometimes broken up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try and three hour time zone changes which was difficult as well but in the six years i was there i was never home for any of my children 's birthdays um you know getting up and leaving at midday to catch a flight back to canberra on mother 's day and things like that this is all quite stressful um to be able to know it that they were unhappy with that that you preferred that more public life to your private kind of emotions i i lost a lot of friends over because i wasn 't able to spend a lot of time with them and they didn 't know how to approach me and deal with me because i was a politician um so that was quite difficult um it was quite stressful in a lot of ways it 's very easy to live in sydney and be a federal member of parliament because the community is quite small there 's people living in west australia north queensland you know up north of western australia we don 't hear that problem a lot do we do tyranny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very difficult because you have to be on on edge all the time because you have to check around who 's listening can i say something can i joke about something for instance i had someone come over to my house because i brought something back from canberra for him he had been knocking on the door i was outside my pool he walked around here i am in the pool why didn 't you answer the front door while i 'm i don 't answer the front door anymore robert because um you know there could be a cat hate cat lover two weeks later was in the sydney morning herald was that right that story really um which so does that suspicion stay with you all your life well into that relationship with that particular person um and there was just this this stress about um about trying to get me in a lot of ways both from my own side of politics more so from my own side of politics than the other side of politics some of my friends no well they 're not friends but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other side of parliament it 's a brutal game isn 't it is our perception of her from outside and that that notion of friendship you you watch them and you go i don 't detect any real friendships of course turnbull gets out and of course everyone else he 's lambasting lambasting them all and and they 're all going we want you out of the liberal party that 's a that 's a sad kind of outcome for people who are in the game of essentially trying to do something good for the punters is the word you use a lot in your book of course yeah and i don 't like people i don 't like the word is that used generally within the game writers no it 's a term used mostly by the labour party is that right they use terms like comrade and punters we normally what i used to call my constituents not punters and used to work hard to to try and um resolve their problems it 's like i was a shopping centre manager as well before coming into politics and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn against you even though you 've done a great job which is what they did in 98 yeah you 've moved away from those roles in business leadership in politics and the cut and thrust of all of that and of course more recently you 've been writing at least three books and then you told me in the in the auntie room that you 've got another six or seven manuscripts as well so so you you 've gone into a more sedentary reclusive living within your own head within your own creativity a lot was that a deliberate ploy to get a counter balance to the mayhem that had been there before or or was this always somewhere you 'd been kind of itching to get i think it 's somewhere that i 've always been itching to get um i 've always wanted to work it with words and write words and wrote as a kid didn 't you yeah i did um whether that was good or not i left school at 16 and that 's what you did you had a choice at 16 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a university scholarship or if you didn 't you ended up with the public service or you left school at 16 to start an apprenticeship and get well paid once you finish your apprenticeship which is what i did um not that i stayed with my trade and my trade doesn 't exist anymore which was in the printing trade okay um but i always had a hankering for advertising and media and things like that sure which was all about creativity but there 's not that not a lot of well-paid jobs in creative stuff so this particular book uh deceit which was called disavow beforehand which was called democracy i sort of thought well okay what i 'll do is i 'll write a trilogy um as opposed to a single book so i started thinking about an ambitious project isn 't it normally most of us go let 's just get a short story out or let 's get a letter to a friend going why started the really ambitious things well because i thought it was because i thought the story was good enough to sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is this particular book deceit 's only over two weeks duplicity 's over the next month and doomed is over two months like two years later but i 'll come to the a little bit more about that later this particular book took about five maybe six years to get down and the reason for that is because you have to be in the groove to write on a regular basis because if you don 't you lose you lose the rhythm of the characters and the story and all that sort of thing so i found it very difficult to because you were still working at the time yeah i was and and and then i finally found it difficult to um to do i went away for two weeks every year to try and get some some stuff done but i was too stressed from work to do any writing so i just lay in the sun but it helped me get some focus i then got it edited a few times had someone over in england read it and give me some suggestions and and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publishing um but since 2016 i 've been writing um full time and the reason for that is because people don 't want to employ people of a certain age you get to a certain age and if i mean if you 're out of out of the work system from 45 on if you 're out of the system then it would be very difficult to get back into it so a lot of these people now who are older folks who are out of the system because of the covet things i feel sorry for them because they 're pro they 're likely not to go back into the system and once you 're out of the system because of your age they don 't want to see it i feel really lucky the library 's giving me these kind of gigs and that right and i do have a sense that she i think i think this is pretty unusual and thank god that that 's kind of happening and i love it and just gives me a great sense of being involved in a very big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gray hairs and not and encourage them to stay in the system because of their knowledge and um and and their their ability to in fact get things done however they think because you pay big bucks for older people that they they 're unemployable i 'd rather take a the salary or young person well think about this most old folks have already paid their mortgage they got rid of their children so they don 't need as much money as they probably used to have to be back in and you can pick up a quality older person for 50 grand a year who turns up every day does their job every day and yet um and yet a lot of employers they don 't want to look at them this could be your new political platform to get you back into politics can we 've done that on that kind of age agenda i like it yeah mature hand out leaflets mature range i try to get some people in um actively thinking about that people like these um company directors and others uh but they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youth unemployment 's 20 well let 's go to old aged unemployment and that 's huge absolutely huge and we don 't talk about it and therefore you have these folks who aren 't working who who then um well they just wait the next 20 years to die well just take that as an example richard and you know getting back to our broader theme of why can 't we get issues like that that are important that hit people where they live that to genuinely come out of the predicament of being alive in this part of the world at this time why can 't we get those those ideas into our national discourse why is it kind of down to you know the trickery and numbers and and and just the economy i 'm not saying the economy is not important but why we reduced it to that because you made a very impassioned plea and i think you would have spoken to people who would have gone gee that 's on the money wise politics doesn 't allow us to get the big creative ideas flowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested in politics because of the negativity associated with politics um so which which creates which what do you mean exactly and people say well we should have we shouldn 't allow politicians to vote on legislation because you know they 're self-interested well no you vote politicians in to in fact represent you but here 's the question how many people who are listening now um how many of you actually know your local member of parliament both your federal state and local government not many do and therefore i ask the question while it 's your apathy that drives the current the current political environment that we live in it 's your apathy that does that and it allows people who manipulate numbers manipulate new immigrant immigrants to booster and staff branches and things like that it 's your apathy that does that and yet we have never been as educated as we are we 've never our libraries are flourishing we 're told people do read in australia these are all you know these are the institutions through which you acquire critical thinking so that that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to to give in to the apathy that you kind of talked about and explain that well let me just explain this genre that i write in my goal is to give readers information about their system that they have and perhaps inform them a little bit more about their political system however when you go to a publisher with what are you writing political thrillers yeah yeah we don 't we 're not interested because no one 's going to buy it i hadn 't read one before to be honest you remain and that was part of the appeal too and i thought i 've never really been within our kind of parliamentary institution let 's talk about your book one of the the central characters of course is gordon who 's the the parliamentary clerk what made you kind of pivot the story a lot around a position that we would have little understanding of that we would think is highly a decorative position but he 's a man that has a very important role was it was it to to make us literate about the political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't just stick to the heavyweights slogging it out we 'll take a different tackle we 'll do it through an unusual character my initial concept was dismissal so i wanted to sack the government and the government was sacked back in 1975 for different reasons totally but i wanted to set the government so i then started thinking about how am i going to do that and then i started researching through parliamentary procedure and things like that and there 's a problem you would have known some of that from you six years too wouldn 't you absolutely and i 've done even more research so i i then identify well then rather than have outside sources just sacking the government why not have an inside source the most powerful people in the parliament are the clerk of the senate and the clerk of the parliament because they actually are the ceos if you like of the whole process so i then focused on this particular gentleman who who was very protective of the parliamentary process and was very proud of that role wasn 't correct and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um you know democracy are very important and i can 't understand why people still try and drag institutions down they if you study history um history is a an indicator that once you start getting rid of your institutions we 're getting rid of statues at the moment but once you start getting rid of institutions the whole democracy the community the culture breaks down if you study history that 's what 's happened and the romans and all these other things so your book had this ambitious attempt to try and educate people in saying be careful about that and and through these institutions you know we will safeguard these things too why pick a creative medium you could have used the rhetorical medium you could use speech making you could use opinion pieces and papers and that why do you think it 's more effective to go via that creative fiction route to try and get across a very serious social point it 's a good question um and i guess one of the answers to that is that this is a one vehicle what we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have people who have served the parliament in some way speaking out against not against the process but informing of the process so that 's what i 'm trying to do um and you have some evidence that that 's cutting through if you had people go i read your book and i didn 't realize the role of the the clerk of parliament and it was an interesting character too and to be so devoted to that cause too he 's the the highly ethical person within your book isn 't he correct the prime minister 's willing to kind of get the money for his you know he 's doing deals with the indonesian president all of that it 's got all those things that are predictable and plays into our perception of politics but you 've got this good who 's rather stodgy doesn 't seem to have any rascality about him or anything does he and frankly that 's the the demeanor of um of those people within the parliament right through the the entire employment within the parliament whether they are their ushers whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have this great need to serve the parliament and you get a lot of strange politicians exotic mystery politicians coming into the place who want to manipulate for their own benefit want to manipulate for their communities benefit want to manipulate anything and consider themselves important too important for the process wilson tucker once told me he said uh know that you 're in the western australian liberal correct wilson tucker you know iron bar they used to call it um and the reason why they call him iron bay is because he used to take an iron bar to all these patrons in the front bar but he said to me know that you 're a vip know it but never show it and so what i try to do is as a member of parliament was be humble enough to be able to to serve and that 's what i tried to do i stepped away after six years my my electorate rejected me but i stepped away after six years thinking that i 've achieved a few things but get to back to your point i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this sort of thing this is the way it was in fact i had the clerk of um the victorian parliament randomly write to me saying that wow you 've really captured how i thought and the way that i wanted to be portrayed where did that inspiration to to kind of build your central character around that because it wouldn 't come just from going i need this position to be understood creativity doesn 't work like that did you have a kind of what if moment did you have a sense of conjuring his presence in a kind of dream did you kind of see him you know on a walk and go that 's the man and his name is gordon o 'brien and i can build a book around him no i had the plot you have to first just now i had the plot first i went through a plan a plan first so i plotted all it all out and then i worked on my protagonist and my and antagonists that they 're the right pronunciations of those words so what i worked on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then once i 've had that plotted out i then worked on the characters and how those characters um looked and felt and what they thought so the plan was in place and what i normally do with a book is i normally do about a 20 000 word plan really i 'm setting it up a chapter so when i sit down and write my chapter you don 't fly by the seat of your pants no i i sort of come to the next chapter okay this is what i 've got to cover in that chapter how 's it really how 's the story going okay i can write about this now is that unusual to work some people will work that way um the others just put a roll of paper and okay what am i going to write about there is that tension that argument in in creative circles isn 't do you have these characters that that are so interesting and you don 't quite quite know their motivations you don 't quite know what the knots are in their character but the writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that person reveal themselves and in that they get themselves into the predicament you 're saying you 've worked in the in the opposite way to that yeah absolutely and try and give some quirky things about about the characters that i work through for instance in this particular book i decided well i 'll name it name all my characters after former prime ministers and former leaders of the opposition so i 'd mix up their surname um so but but andrew gerard i had to change he was andrew fraser so originally so i had to change his name and i changed the the speaker 's name it was um it 's bag shaw now it was bates zara bates was the wife of the prime minister of harold hall so i had to get rid of that so i was thinking about um um was that just as a way of getting people to just no i was thinking about another intriguing level or because members of book clubs and things like that so that they would always talk about the characters and different things and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll manipulate that conception manipulate perceptions and use all these names within the book that people can tweet oh that 's isn 't that the prime minister 's whatever it might be and so therefore um i had to change them all because it was too obvious so so if i walked into your writing room there 's butcher 's papers all over the wall and there 's kind of notes about where the last thing they all said and where they were at that moment and that is it is it to that degree yes and no um i 'm planning out a book a year for the next 10 years so what i 've decided to do is have a character called jack hudson um and he 's going to go i mean come into parliament as a young parliamentarian the 10th book and they 're all going to be stand alone books but the 10th book will be when he retires from the parliament so if i 'm planning that out now i am now up on my wall i 've got okay this is book one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four book five and then i sort of okay bring issues and you open up the front page of any paper and you take an issue and you think okay so it 's a deliberate effort to be contemporary absolutely this is centered around an immigration center isn 't it and the relationship with indonesia and the perception that a lot of people have is indonesian politics is very kind of you you play around with all of that don 't you and the bipartisan approach to building the detention no one 's got any moral qualms about it there 's no characters going you know you that they just keep passing through yeah tell us about what fuels the kind of plot it 's it 's the tension between gordon and the prime minister in part isn 't it and the fact that prime minister is going to try and swindle this money yeah that in any fiction i i guess i don 't haven 't read any romance fiction um but you you are it 's all about conflict sure and the conflict needs to be on every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of staff conflict with characters conflict with whatever it might be um so you need to build that conflict throughout the book and get to a an ending within the book that 's satisfactory so you have that word conflict almost just kind of flashing in your brain all the time every time you write within the dialogue within within the description of driven book isn 't it because a lot of it is in it 's in that parliament house so you 're not taking us out on exotic road trips you 're not going into exotic terrains is it was that a limiting factor or or does it in a strange way give you more room to to do things that maybe if you try to ambitiously to roam all over the place would be hard to pull well it 's a good question because it 's around about 88 000 words now but it was originally 112. yeah okay so what i 've cut out is all the stuff that i wrote about parliament house and procedures and all that stuff which someone told me he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that right so the original book started at chapter three so this particular author said well okay bring all the stuff or give us all the reasons for and put it in the first two chapters which i had to write two new extra chapters on and and you did the prologue didn 't you which starts eight months before the crash yeah why the prologue approach because my advisor said we really need to know the motivations of the prime minister rather than assume it within the within the system because i started with gordon o 'brien at his desk and thinking about retirement and we need to know something beforehand what triggered it and then i didn 't do anything with the plane crash until someone told me that well write something about the plane crash because that adds greater greater depth you could see it coming to the whole reason that pilots don 't get on and you know this is going to end in that did you want to kind of take the book into that precipice of going well we could have a change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is able with his cunning with all his political skills to get an opposition leader to say we 're not going to have any division votes in that was that an extraordinary thing to try and convince the reader that that that 's plausible do you think um i used a lot of um procedural issues so people can who can check uh can can see that it is procedural so it verifies itself against the stuff but this is all part of plotting this is all part of figuring out how this is going to work and that 's all part of the planning process that i work to and i do that with all my books that that i here 's the central theme here 's the subplots how am i going to work this in to to the entire plan but ultimately to the reader to us the punters who come to the libraries we we want we want the texture and the feeling and the moral qualms of the characters too don 't we because that 's too that 's who we kind of stay with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also learning the difference between show and not tell as well and i 've always been conflicted about i 've got a master 's degree in creative writing i still don 't understand show and not tell it 's a difficult concept oh look it is um so and less is more yeah so there 's a there 's an author that um that i read recently that she wanted to describe a character so so this particular author used a stereotypical way of doing that by describing the person as she stood in front of a mirror i mean that 's just to me you know she 's published does well but to me that 's just no that 's treating the reader with a little bit a bit of disrespect so you need to sort of release um issues about the character and leave it to the imagination of the reader absolutely i i didn 't use a lot of description on gordon o 'brien yeah but i 'm sure that you 've got a perception of what he 's like i didn 't use and if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not the gordon in my head and we 'd all kind of which is lovely isn 't it because we we have our own characters in our own hands you know and i was thinking to be honest with you what i was thinking about was that if it ever went to film who would who would i want to play gordon o 'brien i 'm available that 's all i can say so i was thinking about jeffrey rush so as i was writing the story i was thinking about jeffrey rush and how would he do this he 'd probably do it this way tell us about the compactness of the book because it takes place over this time that gordon 's about to retire you deliberately set yourself this kind of tight restraint which means there 's got to be a lot of people going into other people 's offices and gordon you know kind of talking to the speaker of the house did you want to kind of have it all kind of happening in this terribly mesh confinement and that was the yeah absolutely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i was talking about so we got to the it 's a stand-alone book so we get to the sacking of the of the government towards the end i wasn 't going to reveal anything yeah but that 's it 's cool you know and that 's what it 's all about um the second book is the next 30 days after that okay which again is a standalone book which again has got a um and you were always confident the book had enough storytelling momentum to get through a trilogy yeah you sound like because because politics is such an exotic um part of our lives that we don 't know a lot about it but there 's always conflict there 's always strange characters within it people who who are doing things for themselves so there 's always all these folks that are contributing to a perfect backdrop of suspense and and thrillers the next one 's about the election campaign and i 've drawn upon different different people within the history of politics to actually base my characters on and then it 's two years later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know frankly we 've had so many leadership challenges it was pretty easy to write tell us about anita devlin in new york just to tell the punters who she is and what part she plays in the story well anita was originally called anita anita being anita keating and and she was originally a deacon we 're going to be doing a lot of these through this so originally anita deacon and deacon was a former prime minister australia so i had to change it to anita devlin now anita is a journalist working in the gallery and and she comes across she 's an investigative journalist and wants to do the right thing doesn 't support either party wants to investigate and she 's out there uh trying to find out what 's going on she 's having a sexual relationship with one of the parliamentarians too wasn 't she well not immediately um but there is a suggestion that that that that she wants to have a relationship with someone there 's no that doesn 't happen until the second book bruno but the point being is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that relationship so there 's the conflict of that yeah because there 's an attraction yeah there is um but she doesn 't want to get actively involved because she wants to stand up stand up independent of all that the real good representation of the investigative journalists who are around the parliamentary scene look i think so um but at the same time um because she 's intent on trying to find where the shenanigans are going isn 't she correct in a sense she 's got the kind of motivations we hope our principal characters will display courage and audacity and things like that um the the the press play a role in politics they play an active role in manipulating the perceptions and if they are pro a politician sure they 'll support and write complementary articles about them if they 're not pro that politician they 'll write negative articles about them all the time but they 'll have their own idealism about what they think politics should be achieving too won 't they they 're not they think they 're players they think they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think themselves as being independent but no they 're players and if they if they vote a certain way then that 's going to influence how they report and you can see that in the way reporters journalists who report on canberra what the words they use and how they report particular issues is it not possible to to keep your integrity and keep distant from from the fray but still be there reporting as honestly as you can you seem to be suggesting that we get tainted we we have to kind of succumb to the to the kind of a morality of the place so in terms of um someone like laurie oakes larry oakes is a respected journalist and um media gallery person i was part of a committee that was inquiring into roz kellen was kelly our minister um and there was sports reports yeah um she 'd written everything on a whiteboard yeah yeah yeah as if but um the point being is that oaks came on i think in december and said nothing to see here nothing to see here that you know they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was doing that i don 't know but but it seemed to that they someone wanted to end the inquiry and it wasn 't until the following january or february we were still we had the um the auditor general came in and said it was the easy money programmers like me attracting blow flies and i thought that 's an interesting comment so i wrote it down and gave it to a few journalists who then used it to blow up the uh the whole enquiry roz kelly eventually left and left the parliament so you 've personally been involved in some of these giving leads to people you know at one point in the story gordon kind of gets a note across doesn 't he to someone which is stepping outside his realm and that isn 't it yeah look the way you feed the journalists is um is that they 're always looking for a story they 're always looking to get ahead and so therefore some are fed correct information some are not correct information so i took a load because it was uh what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i thought the way i was thinking was that there 's a high lot of pressure upon burying this whole enquiry and i said no no we need to have a look at this and so i started leaking towards the media and did which was contributed to all of our monitoring process yeah yeah did you get found out about that no no i don 't often talk about this you just that 's fine keating would have said i 'm in politics because that 's the main game that 's where you can do the things that i think you wanted and keating keating strangely is against euthanasia yeah absolutely sure but i was just the broad question of going that 's the main game and you 've been in that game and you 're going it kind of doesn 't work and now you 've taken this this you know and who 's going to read your book i 'm not i don 't mean that derisively i mean it 's going to be a small number it 's it 's an act that requires i sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lovely privilege to have an audience that would want to do that but that that 's against the tenor of the times because the 10 of the time says you 've got 10 seconds to get your message plus but you i 've got to bring my consideredness to this i 've got to bring my intelligence i 've got to bring all of who i am to to really take the book in and think about it too so my question again is why invest in that that might have little return it must have some deep kind of oh i think there 's a satisfying element to it yeah i can 't be god elsewhere perhaps i don 't know i 'm guessing i think there 's a teaching element that i that i 've wanted to do there 's an education element that i want to do that i 've always had i mean i used to be a public speaker before politics and all that sort of stuff and educating training people and i 've always had that sort of notion to in fact be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never went to university until i was late in life this is through the the medium of an art form isn 't it correct yes which is allowing that person to go think of it what you will and make of this what you will ultimately i think from what you were saying that you spent three days on it and you thought about it well that 's what i want from it i want i want a reader to think well i didn 't know that does this really happen um and that and quit and start to question those sorts of things if i can impart within aboriginal sovereignty and euthanasia and water rights and all that sort of stuff if i can impart them to think about the issue whilst being excited by the characters and the thrilling nature of the characters and the story well then to be in an art form like yours where you 've asked that which is quite an exacting ask isn 't it stay with my book stay with the characters live in my book you know for three days i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clifton hill that 's a magical thing to pull off isn 't it yes and that 's the great skill i guess or great craft is probably a better word of a writer or even anyone with creativity whether it 's a painter or or any any creative person that they want people to interpret stay with the try and understand what we 're trying to and in part some people will come back and say i did that that must be an enormous random responses is really that 's fantastic i mean right into it and then they find me on the internet and they and they write to me and say look um this is fantastic which is great feedback but you know um you 're not going to get the negative ones who can burn the book in front of you no they 're not going to do that but what i 'm saying to you is that that 's going to have that courage to go this might upset people people aren 't gonna want to politicians aren 't want to they 're not gonna enjoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of skeletons well they 'll probably say it 's not made it 's all the others that 's all the others it 's not me look i 've got a prime minister who wanted to um to to earn millions how many former prime ministers do you know that became veganism yeah is that so far-fetched is that is that within the realms of possibility correct it is absolutely this is not just taking it a bit too far being a bit kind of exaggerated in order to make it poor you 're going what you wrote in that book could one day happen within it probably already has but politicians i 've learned are interested in two things they 're interested in votes and money not necessarily money to put in their own pocket but money to get the votes so they 'll manipulate legislation they 'll manipulate policy they 'll manipulate communities they 'll manipulate whatever it is to get the votes why so they can be they can patronize people in other words patrons give give them hand out money and all that stuff at the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it you and i in our 60s that 's not enough because that that 's kind of that 's going to crumble the the facade then crumbles you know which is what ultimately we would say probably we want to go have i loved and have i known how to love you know sorry and have i mattered well yes you know and to be taken seriously as we all want to be done and whether that 's in the way politicians speak to us or or wherever we are all of those things are really important aren 't they but it doesn 't seem to get kind of translated through i think there 's enormous good will i love the writers i meet i think they 're people who are genuinely humble most of them genuinely concerned about putting out something there and they don 't big note themselves and they are privileged the fact that me mr punter i don 't have a degree in literature but i come to your book with a certain openness and i live in your book i think it 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personally if i 'm going to do something that might be a kind of action that might be out in the world often it 's stimulated by a book a line of poetry a line of something like that that is really beautiful have you lost that ability to do that because you wouldn 't want your kids not to think that you 've lost that ability to believe in those things well i 'm in my 60s now my father died when he was 69 so i 'm close to that sort of age sure and so you start thinking about your mortality but then i may have another 30 odd years or i may have another year but you 're not going to leave your kids it 's a legacy yeah what legacy can we leave them that that i can show part of you um at the same time try and influence matter within the community and trying to influence that now i 've got a lot still what i want to do except except the community doesn 't want that because we 're too old um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age dad you know with the long hair and and i think yeah paradoxically we 're here and we 've been given this very gracious opportunity to still do that haven 't we you 're a means so but i still like i said if i i said to my daughter if i acted my age i think i 'd be bored because most folks are bully except for you bruno of course because you know because i 'm subject i don 't know why i said that last question i come to you and i go i want to write a thriller can you put on your everything you 've learned from having written this trilogy and the other unpublished books give me some guiding principles about writing thrillers that are quite different to other forms of writing what what what should we be aware of what should we be cautious about well ultimately and this is a good question because it it varies an awful lot i mean you 've got tim winton over here you 've got a helen gardner over there and you 've got richard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over there the question the question is to sort of ask is okay well what do you what 's the outcome you want to have within the book i mean what 's the fill factor if you look at jane harper for instance she 's written a number of books that she she followed step by step within going to a writing class so here 's some processes what 's the relationship through line what 's the plot through line what 's the character through lines so these are all the things that you need to consider as you 're planning your book out and as i said what i normally do is sit down and write out 32 chapters and do the plan right through the book which is around about 20. it 's about 20 000 words and i don 't use any of those words i just use them to prompt me when i 'm writing the 4 000 words for each chapter so you think that 's a fairly good template for most people for me for me it is it works for me and i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get stuck on a character i mean i 'll give you an example i mean the the most recent book i 've written about is is about water rights up in the mallee and and i got to 85 000 words i had three chapters left and it wasn 't working it wasn 't working for me yeah i couldn 't figure out that 's the thing isn 't it because in your realm i 'm guessing because i 've never tried to write a novel is you must go what if i get to a point where i spend you know couple years then i go it just dies and i don 't know how to well get stuck or it just doesn 't go away to explain what had happened was that i sort of sat down and thought for a month because i wanted to finish it before christmas and i started in october and i wanted to finish before christmas so just before christmas i i sort of ah it 's not working for me got three chapters left i don 't know how it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to kill someone once i realized i had to kill someone i then had to work out well how do i do that and why do i do that and so therefore it the book ended up pretty pretty good to me to be honest and richard it 's been a great thrill we we 've gasped back for about an hour and a half or an hour and 20 minutes you know the politicians say people can 't listen for more than 10 seconds i reckon they 're wrong about that i hope people get a lot of enjoyment was was a great thrill reading your book and i 'm not a political thriller reader so i love where it took me and i love thinking about things that i 've not had to think about before so well i i would encourage folks to uh to read the book but at the same time get actively involved in discussions about things yeah and learn to listen about the difference with their different points of view i think it 's important for our community that we do that and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and i want to thank the marybellong library services"

put it on yourself yourself what 's the deal here right but it 's because we don 't take care of ourselves we can 't tear them so for leaders what i always tell them is it 's you first it starts with you and it starts with your psychology eighty percent of growing a business if you look at what the chokehold is on a business it 's always the leader and eighty percent of that chokehold is the psychology of 20 the mechanics i mean people in this room know the mechanics and strategies beyond what anybody on earth knows in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state where you execute it 's like i always tell people knowledge is not power it 's total bs knowledge is potential power execution trump 's knowledge every day of the week and so my life is how do you get yourself to execute and execution

even see it as a limitation you might see it as just that 's who i am but so often in our lives we 've adapted to be a certain way so that we don 't fail or so that people will like us or respect us but it 's not necessarily who we are joy comes when you 're spontaneous it 's really hard to be truly happy when you 're not being yourself and most of us have no clue who we are and so a big part of my work if you 've ever been to an event you know is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's when the real you shows up that 's when the energy comes alive and when you do that when you start to connect your true nature suddenly there 's energy available for you to set a higher standard for what you want in your life that 's what this is really all about and when i talk about standards when i talk about you know shoulds versus musts think about your own life i know there have been areas in your life where some point in time you just shifted and you raised the standard and your life changed because whatever people have their identity attached to they live we live who we believe we are that 's just how it works it 's just kind of like i give an example look at your physical body your physical body today is an absolute reflection of only one thing not your goals not your desires but your standards the identity you have for yourself if your standard is you 're an athlete then there 's a certain amount of strength a muscle tone and energy that 's available in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are and so you do whatever is necessary to maintain that identity again the strongest force in the human personalities this need to stay consistent with how we define ourselves because if you don 't know who you are you would know how to act once you lock in on that identity your brain finds a way to keep you there if you say you know man i 'm overweight i 've always been overweight i 'm big boned and that 's the story you got then you 're gonna always find a way to get back there that 's your settling point that 's your identity that 's where things lock in if you see somebody who 's in really great shape you ask them do you work out you know the answer yes how often and they 'll tell you three times four times five times a week whatever in a seminar last people who here works out at least five days a week and i 'm stand up and you look around that room and you know that they work out five times a week because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a result without some kind of action without some form of ritual ritual meaning actions you do consistently now do you think those people that are out there working out five days a week do they have more time than you do or i have or anybody else of course not is their life less busy of course not it 's just a must for them they must work out that way and they 've made that turn their life changed so i 'm not saying you have to work out five days a week i 'm just saying whatever you really want once don 't get met consistently standards do whatever you identify this is who i am and so it 's not so much about changing your identity as there 's expanding it you know deciding that you know instead of your goals to lose 10 pounds which is not compelling what if your vision was to get back to my fighting weight you know this this year this month this next 90 days i 'm going to transform my body i 'm going to take on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strategy there 's a million of them that can reframe myself where i want to feel younger stronger more vibrant than ever before here 's my reasons because i want the energy to really make my life work because it 's tough out there and i want to be stronger than i 've ever been before i want to go in front of the mirror if i 'm naked not you know want to laugh i won 't look there and take a good look and go yeah okay that was chest really intense but it 's really um it 's really effective because you don 't need to go to the gym to still get the results that you want and also the the easier it gets the more reps you should do because it just means that your muscles are recovering and so let me just just quick explanation on how muscle recovery works when we work out our muscles rip and tear right so it takes about 48 hours for it to repair and when it repairs it becomes 10 times stronger than it already was so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a week straight the next week the 10 kilos might feel like 5 kilos so that just kind of shows consistency and and repetition really works and you make that a habit your body gets used to it and just remember go your own pace and push yourself to the limit because you don 't really know your limit until you hit it but will you hit it is a question"

    "text": "[Music] do good morning everyone welcome to story time at home with merrimber on libraries i 'm christine it 's fantastic to see you again we 're gonna have some fun today we 've got some stories for you i 've got some stories about boats and tractors does that sound like fun all right well let 's start off with our hello song you ready you 're gonna clap your hands and stomp your feet hello hello can you clap your hands hello hello can you clap your hands can you reach up high and can you touch your toes can you turn around and can you say hello hello everyone all right let 's stomp our feet you ready hello hello can you stomp your feet that 's it hello hello can you stomp your feet good one can you reach up high and can you touch your toes can you turn around and can you say hello very good all right let 's do it one more time we 've got those clapping hands going ready hello hello can you clap your hands hello hello can you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you touch your toes can you turn around and can you say hello hello all right then let us do zoom zoom zoom shall we go to the moon you ready zoom zoom zoom we 're going to the moon zoom zoom zoom we 're going to the moon if you want to take a trip climb aboard my rocket ship zoom zoom zoom we 're going to the moon off we go to the moon all right let 's go we 've got some great stories as i said today the first one we 're going to read is brilliant boats by tony mitchen and ant parker and it 's published by macmillan shall we have a look who likes going on boats i sure do like going on the sea on a boat like that all right let 's go boats are really brilliant for sailing us around they travel through the water with a sloppy sloppy sound have you been on a boat it 's fun to go out boating especially in the sun the water 's cool and sparkly so come on everyone woohoo that sounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empty bowl or cup it 's hollow and it 's full of air and that 's what keeps it up an anchor holds you steady when you 're bobbing in the bay you wind a chain to raise it and when you want to sail away pulling up that anchor over lakes and seas and rivers wind blows very strong some boats have sails to catch it so it pushes them along to manage boats with masts and sails you need a clever crew the captain is the one in charge who tells them what to do and he says aye aye captain [Applause] a dinghy or a rowing boat is useful near the shore you make it travel backwards by pulling on each or you 'll do railroad your boat after the story i think a motorboat is powered by propeller from the back it washes through the water and it leaves a foamy track look at that whoosh through the water and just in case by accident you tumble from the boat you have to wear a life jacket made to help you float well that 's good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ocean waves are steep their nets are cast to catch the fish and then hold them in from the deep look at that a big haul of fish coming in a ship can carry cargo which is loaded on the docks hump ho look out below here comes a giant box look at that giant box a ferry carries cars and lorries where they need to go the people travel up above and the vehicles they stay below have you ever been on a ferry like that where you drive onto the boat a mighty ocean liner has a big and busy crew it carries many passages they 're waving now the ship has cozy cabins where the passengers can stay and out on deck they stroll about and watch the sea or play they do all sorts of things on those boats there there 's even a swimming pool in this one but when the journey 's over ahoy the lighthouse rock the ship glides into harbor and ties up at the dock there it is in it comes and that 's the end and these are all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lighthouse and an anchor and the oars and the propeller and that 's the deck of the boat and that has the cabin there and the name of the boat well that was a good story wasn 't it so let 's do row row row your boat you ready have you got your oars you can sit down you can stand up to do this and it 's like this and we 're going to row row row your boat you ready row row row your boat gently down the stream merrily merrily merrily merrily life is but a dream row row row your boat gently down the stream if you see a crocodile don 't forget to scream all right that was fun story about boats and singing about boats isn 't it so our other story today is also by tony mitten and aunt parker and it 's called tremendous tractors just come in a bit closer because this is only a little book so maybe you can see it a bit better now all right tremendous chuggy tractors so sturdy and so strong connecting up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their big black tires have solid treads which help them not to slip these chunky treads can chew the ground and get the wheels to grip look at those big wheels a tractor works on farmland so its body must be tough it sits up high above the ground for farmland can be rough to grow their crops the farmers have to start by sowing seed but first to break the ground up a plow is what they need look at that big plow pulling up all the ground there a tractor pulls the plow across the field up and down the plow blades cut the soil into furrows rich and brown the tractor hauls the harrow next to break the soil some more the metal discs crush up the clods and that 's what the harrow is for look at that lots of big work happening here it 's time to use the roller now the long tube rolls around to flatten out the field pushing stones beneath the ground the seed drill has a hopper a seed box that you 'll fill when it 's time for planting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeds in there the seed drill makes a row of grooves in which the seed can drop the spikes then rake a covering of soil across the top if the crops are hay crop you mow when it 's grown the grass is left in tidy rows to dry when it 's been mown have you ever seen hay out in big hay bales out in the paddocks later on a bayless scoop the stalks up from the ground and shapes them into bails which are bundled square all round these ones are square look at those a bale of hay is heavy so it 's very hard to lift a bale fork on a tractor makes it easier to shift gosh tractors are good aren 't they if the crop 's a grain crop when harvest time is here a great big combine harvester can get the whole crop clear look at that big red harvester there and all of that and it goes in there and it comes out this side with all of the grain it cuts the stalks and threshes them to knock the grain right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grain spills from the spout look at that but it 's pretty noisy too a tractor with a trailer ships bales of straw or hay rakes food to hungry animals or carries the crops away the tractor and the farmer work hard and do their best so when the day is over they both deserve a rest they sure do don 't they big hard work on the farm that 's excellent and that 's the end of that tremendous tractors well that 's all we have time for it 's story time today thank you for joining me for those great books about boats and tractors maybe you could go and find some coloring in about a tractor would that be fun to do and do some coloring in today all right we 'll see you later shall we do our goodbye song see you later in a wild crocodile give a hug ladybug blow a kiss jellyfish see you soon big baboon out the door dinosaur big one ra take care koala bear wave goodbye butterfly you"

    "text": "[Music] hi everyone and welcome to another edition of build make and creates with baron vernon libraries today we have a very special guest professor christy from junior science has joined us and she 's going to show us how to make an air freshener so it 's amazing the things that you can make at home isn 't it i hope you enjoy watching professor christie make this wonderful air freshener and maybe you can make one too hello i 'm professor christie from marabong libraries and today we 're going to make our very own air freshener and learn about a very special molecule called a polymer so what you 'll need for this experiment is a glass jar some gelatin some salt got some salt flakes in there some food coloring and some sort of smelling oil so i 've got lavender here but you might like to use eucalypt oil or tea tree oil whatever smell you liked i thought i 'd use lavender to bring the smell of spring into my house you 'll also need some hot water so you might need to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to burn yourself so first of all what we 'll do is grab our hot water and it is very hot so i 've got to be very careful and i 'm going to slowly pour that into my jar we can see the steam coming off oh that is hot and leave it there next i 'm going to add one teaspoon of gelatin and the reason why we need hot water is because we need to dissolve the gelatin so i 'm going to give that a stir until i can see it 's dissolved [Music] you don 't want to stir too fast because you might splash it out of the sides it 's a good idea to put something down underneath in case you make a little bit of a mess like i will okay so that one 's looking nice and dissolved so what we 'll do next is add a little bit of food coloring i might use a tiny bit of red for my one to make it nice and vibrant and you don 't have to add food cuddling coloring you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you might like to go out into your garden pick some lovely flowers and put them into it whatever you like so now we 've given that one a little bit of a stir that 's all in there so next i 'm going to add a few drops of my oil so this is lavender it smells beautiful already just put a few little drops in and i 'll give that a one more little stir now the last thing i 'm going to add in is one teaspoon of salt so i 'll just measure that out and in that goes and the reason we add salt is because salt acts as a preservative so that makes sure that we don 't grow any bacteria on our room freshener because that would not be good at all now as you can see that 's still a liquid so what we need to do is put it into the fridge overnight so that it sets and forms a gel just like you would do if you 're making a nice jelly so i 'm going to put this one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and i 've got this one here and as you can see it 's a gel i popped a few lavender leaves in yesterday that 's what those little things are for and now i can put this anywhere in my house and i 'll have the beautiful smell of lavender coming out well that 's all there is for today so i hope you go and make lovely room fresheners and i can 't wait to hear all about them i 'll see you next time bye easy was that fantastic i 'm going to go and have a go at making one of those and if you have make one two maybe you can put it in your room and make it all nice and smell like spring like the one that professor christie made we 'll see you next time bye"

and i 'll be your host this evening let 's get on with the evening an evening of insights tips and inspiration joining us tonight is karina kilmore she has over 30 years experience as a writer and as a newspaper journalist she 's written for magazines for papers news websites and all together her published work would be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the prestigious unpublished manuscripts award at the victorian premieres literary awards for her novel where the truth lies and in march this year right before lockdown this book was published by simone and simon sorry and schuster i 'd like to welcome our very special guest karina killmore welcome karina thank you very much thank you it 's great to be here i 'm i 'm a little bit nervous everybody so um treat me kindly please this is the first zoom workshop i 've done so and i 've been really looking forward to doing it so a little bit about me i was brought up by my grandmother in a very large political family in new zealand we had a strange sort of dysfunctional tradition where my mother was brought up by her grandmother and she lived in a big old timber house with her father and a whole bunch of bachelor uncles they were all ruled over by the matriarch my great grandmother nana douglas these men my grandfather and great uncles were labourers and wolfies and truck drivers and they were all very staunch unionists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and do i enter the corporate world but not before i dropped out of school um high school at age 14 and i got myself a job luckily i was taken under the wing of some very good people some very good bosses and when i was old enough i was encouraged to go to uni so as an adult student i went back to uni um but that was not before i worked in a factory screwing on bottle tops as a sped pass on a conveyor belt i worked in a call center selling ads and then as a typesetter for a newspaper so as soon as i was old enough to qualify as an adult student i started my education again studying part-time for a business degree and that 's where i learned more about the economy and capitalism and the other side of that big tribal union divide which i 'd grown up in but office work wasn 't um where my heart lay and while i still um while i 'm still working as a typesetter for my local newspaper my boss encouraged me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever since specialising in finance and business reporting so you could say um multiple crime stories during that time i 've written about as linda said three million words for newspapers and publications which is a equivalent of about 30 novels added to that i 've also written three non-fiction investment and finance books i 've also been a books editor and i 'm still a regular published book reviewer but my first novel my first fiction work is a new benchmark for me the title is where the truth lies and here 's when i produced earlier it was published in march just in time for the lockdown sadly and cancellation of my book tour and all the book events um but i 'll give you the elevator pitch because i practiced it at the time even though i never got to say it so the elevator pitch was um it 's about a melbourne journalist who investigates a death at the wharf and she 's caught between the worlds of blue collar and white collar crime and underlying the story is a lot of real-life newsroom activity the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's all set around gorgeous melbourne but of course that 's all wrapped up in a gritty urban crime story and that 's told through the eyes of my damaged but feisty my main character chrissy o 'brien so that 's me and that 's my book and so let 's get on to the topics now that i 'd like to discuss with you all tonight um it 's aimed at helping you to start writing your novel um your first novel i did it so i think you can do it too and i hope that um anything i 've got tonight to say will help you along the way so the first three things i wanted to talk about was establishing a writing routine how to narrow down your story ideas and choosing the best starting point and if you 're wondering i 've got these dot points on my screen so i might look a bit shifty but i 'm just sort of trying to catch up on to make sure that i 've got my all my dot points covered um so establishing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day a combination of days where you can set aside a writing time this could be a daily writing hour or twice a week or even once a week you also need to decide on a space where you can spend this time and try out the space or try out a couple of spaces listen for noises and vision and the comfort of the space it also may not be in your home it may be at a library or a community centre which by the way are the are great places for observing characters it could be a cafe or a friend 's house you could buddy up with someone to keep each other accountable just don 't talk too much or drink too much but think about where you need um what you need in your space and what time you 'll be able to devote to it um of course covert is a barrier um to some of these locations at the moment but think outside the square it doesn 't have to be a desk at home i suggested to a friend recently that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could get away from her crowded house and it 's working she takes a coffee and a snack a laptop or a notepad her latest book or research and she sits in the passenger seat of the car in the street outside her house she 's still close enough to connect to her wi-fi so she uses her car for her writing time even if you don 't actually do much writing during this time still make yourself go and sit in your writing spot for the whole time regardless if you 're not writing or you 're having doubts about how to keep going use this writing time for thinking instead which when you know you think about it as a real luxury these days i mean how often do we ever get time just to sit and think so think about your books that you like or stories you 'd like to write in the future think about what you 've written so far if you 're starting a new project write an outline or a rough plotline or describe your main character maybe you 're a visual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your characters or just note down potential story ideas or new angles for an existing novel new themes just anything really ideally this regular time should be at least an hour but preferably two or more hours in each block because by the time you get into your headspace you can often already have used up quite a bit of your writing time so to recap on routine find your time and your days and whether you 're writing or not still go to your writing spot and use that time for thinking or reading or planning and of course when you are in the swing of it all you 'll already have this routine established and it 'll feel more comfortable and easy to actually do the writing now this is also a bit of a tricky point but just a note on family and friends some people will find that their partners or kids aren 't as supportive as they hope it usually starts out okay but then precious writing time or your preoccupation with your writing can sometimes cause resentment hopefully this is not your experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or minimize your efforts um or just make you doubt yourself even if you know these comments um come from selfishness or the person 's different priorities they can still hurt and they can make it hard to talk about your writing with them and it can make you feel guilty about taking time or just make you doubt yourself so on the surface some of these comments and reactions can seem as if they 're sensible or logical but underneath there can also be some sabotage going on so don 't don 't think um you 're alone if you start to feel pressure like this it 's known it 's common and it 's like everything else to do with writing it 's hard and you just have to stick to your guns okay let 's go on to the next topic which is how to narrow down your story ideas most writers seem to have lots of story ideas but the ideas seem to fall into two camps one camp is the big picture they have a rough idea of the arc of the story and what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not too much detail about the beginning or the characters or how to get to the middle or to the end so that 's a big picture idea the other type of ideas person seems to be very very focused the idea is often just about one small event or one character but again with not much detail about everything else around that event or how to showcase that character in a long piece of work your writing routine is the perfect space and time to think about how to flesh out more details for the big picture ideas start thinking about who 's going to carry that idea is it going to be a main character or three characters or perhaps it 's going to be a location um and just a word about location ideally you always need to have to um to have been to the location you 're writing about but now with google earth or street view it opens up other options so it 's actually quite a good good way um to travel from your zoom lounge um for riders with a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or side issues which could be used to lead into the main event in both cases you know if you 're a big ideas or a focused ideas person start thinking about building a support or framework around your character ideally as a or your or around your big event ideally as a reader we want to know how someone has changed or something changes someone but no one can tell you where your story has to go or how many subplots or themes or characters is totally in your hands but one of the biggest hurdles for many writers even really experienced writers is they get lost or stuck at about 20 000 words they 've been so excited about their big picture or their detailed character that they don 't have enough world to put world building around them to keep going this also usually means many writers fall into one or two other groups known as pantsers and plotters a pantser that 's me i fly by the seat of my pants i have a rough idea of my story and just gets stuck in and write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go a plotter which is what i suggest everyone else should be plans out their story and characters their timelines and their themes in advance but i think in a real world a mixture of both is probably going to suit most writers that could be something like not plotting a whole novel but setting out a chapter list of what you want to happen you don 't have to stick to the list but at least it 's a little roadmap during those times when you realize you 're not sure what to write next for new and emerging writers until you get into your own swing of things i think a rough outline or chapter list can really save you a lot of frustration so just a final few words on how to narrow down your story idea if you take up some of the plotter habits even just attempt a rough chapter list regardless if you 're a big picture ideas person or a small focused ideas person i think you 'll almost automatically see where you need to bring in new characters or expand on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can broaden your story because your chapter list is going to look very thin and small so that 's sort of like an automatic um signal that you need to think a bit broader than um your original idea or to narrow down your original idea and focus in on some of the smaller details so our third topic for this part is choosing the starting point of your story and i 'm going to use the word story more for this point because it applies equally to a work of fiction or non-fiction and probably to other writing forms too such as poems and songs but choosing where to start your story either for a novel or a short story or a non-fiction book is really important the start of your writing has to grab the reader 's attention it 's a lot like journalism the most exciting emotional shocking thing should come first if the opening pages or chapter um don 't grab the reader then the reader won 't ever get to see that you saved up the best bits for later but by this i don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plot in the first few pages i mean that you need to make people care as soon as possible make them care about finding that answer if you pose a question make them care about the main character if you start with a person make them care about the repercussions of an event if you start with a restaurant scene or an explosion or a car crash a boxing match to a divorce or someone saying goodbye to their pet dog the reader has to care about what comes next and this applies pretty much always even if you 're writing a memoir or a family saga start off with a hint of the most fascinating or devastating or exhilarating event in that story and once you have your reader caring you can go back and begin to trickle out the full details of the story um so to recap where to start your story start at the point where you 'll make the reader care um okay so let 's get to some questions about those three points so the three points that we discussed were setting a routine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story okay sabrina we have a question great it has to deal with uh how you deal with frustration any tips on what to do when you 're feeling frustrated in your room um i haven 't got a solution to that because i get frustrated and i usually stay frustrated but i know two authors who stop writing and they go for a run um physical exercise seems to be like a good way to clear the mind if you 're stuck on a story point the most i can manage is sort of like a half trot but um it 's really it 's a really hard one frustration is a it can be quite devastating it can throw you off your story it can throw your throw you off your confidence and it can really um make you start um wondering if you should be doing this at all um so i think you just have to work through it you just have to push through it and there 's another question you made the point that um to start with the most exhilarating point of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style overcome the need to start with the most exhilarating point of the story yes i think it can um i just read um i 've just been doing some judging i 've just read a book where it started in a very unconventional way and it was a very um lyrical um sort of long winded introduction but it still gripped my attention and that sort of writing is really hard to do i think um it was a very um experienced author um you know sort of into their 20-something book so it 's a very um it 's a very hard thing to do to attract someone 's attention without it being exciting or something to make you care about at the start so i wouldn 't recommend it for new or emerging writers but there are lots of examples um of that type of writing where you lull someone into a almost into a false sense of security or you um you just sort of let them softly come into your story life and it 's it 's it 's lovely writing but it 's really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is really hard i 've got a little a few points about that in coming up in in and something i 'm going to talk about later it 's i 'm i 'm my biggest critic um so that 's um and and i 've worked in newspapers all my life and you you can 't have a thin skin and newspapers you you 're um shouted at you 're you know you 're told you 're useless you it 's a really tough environment to work so you develop a very thick skin and um when i read the first review of my novel i i was just devastated by it it was um by someone who wanted to make a name for themselves as a you know to get the first copy of my book and to write her eye-catching review about it and as a reviewer myself i would never write a review like this person wrote about my book i would always be you know you judge a book by its type um not about you it shouldn 't really be about your personal opinion so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it 's really hard now that i 'm a published author it 's really hard as a journalist um i was used to the trolling used to the abuse um you know which is a daily thing as a journalist but as a as an author where it 's like a personal uh piece of writing and i wasn 't prepared for how um difficult i would find it we have a message here saying hi karina thank you for your insight uh what is your advice when dealing with writer 's block in the area of non-fiction where you are unable to create characters ideas to propel your writing forward yeah so i 've written non-fiction all my life as a journalist you are a non-fiction writer as a magazine writer you 're usually reporting on things or reporting on non-fiction and i don 't believe in writer 's block i don 't think that you can have writer 's block um why would writers you know a bus driver can 't have a bus driver 's block or a chef can 't have a chef block i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your mind there 's no such thing as writer 's block if you need to take a break take a break you know if you 're if you 're lacking ideas then do some more research but i 've banned writer 's block it no longer exists that 's very good that 's very very good um now do you write with a particular audience in mind when you set out did you have an audience in mind before you started writing where the truth was i didn 't have an audience in mind but i like crime fiction and so i was always leaning towards a crime fiction piece of work and most readers are women and most book buyers are women i think about 80 or 80 something percent of books are purchased by women they often purchase them for their males the males in their household um so apart from that sort of big picture world of um you know women were the main audience for all books i didn 't have an audience in mind but i did have as a woman i wanted to write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important there 's lots of women who write about male characters especially in the crime genre and i wanted to be a woman who wrote a female character so that that was my sort of only um guiding light really and i 'm a big fan of or have been a big fan for many years of sarah perezki and she wrote a series of books with a really feisty um feminist um character um the first one came out in the 1980s and she and she um was a really big inspiration for me so i wanted a strong female character and i wanted to write it from a woman writing from a woman 's point of view as well how do you let go of stuff that you 've written that you think is really great but it just doesn 't fit in to the story i cut and paste it into a spare document and i tell myself i 'm not deleting it i 'm just putting it aside and chances are i never read it again but to actually delete it i just can 't do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that i 'm going to i 'm just taking it out for now i 'm just putting it aside and i 'll find a spot for it sometime in the future that 's great thank you karina for that insight that 's wonderful thank you okay shall we go on to the next um little bit i think so yes great um okay so um the next uh couple of topics i 'd love to discuss with you is um about um how to present your manuscript um self-editing paying for an assessment or an editor and then some quick comments about competitions so manuscripts i don 't think anyone needs expensive or fancy software i know lots of authors who simply use old word processing programs some write the whole book in one document another author i know opens a new document for each chapter so he has about 30 or 40 documents each with a chapter in it and he likes it this way because sometimes he 'll shuffle the sequence around or add or delete a whole chapter so he finds that really easy to do i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cross between a normal old word program and the more fancy complicated programs like scrivener i did look at scrivener when i first decided to write a novel but i found it so complicated that i couldn 't take the risk i wanted to concentrate on the writing and not have to wade through a massive instruction manual each day and i also found that my writing style which is pretty much start at the beginning and write in a logical chronological way to the end i found that my writing style didn 't really need much of the extra fancy functions of of something like scrivener and so i went for write it now and shallow person that i am i also like the practical name of the software software it 's called write it now and i just thought oh yes that 's me i want to write it now um but of course i 've had a couple of problems with it and the designer is based in the uk but every time i 've emailed a query i 've received a detailed answer and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an actual email from the designer with specific solutions so i 've been really pleased with that i found it really great but okay so the standard format for most manuscripts is 12 point type a simple typeface some publishers will tell you their preferred typeface and some agents too they 'll often have favorites but generally i 'd use a something like a new times roman or or something in that family line spacing is either one and a half or double spacing i strongly suggest you get used to writing this way from the start it will go a long way to getting you in the groove of knowing how many words and pages make up your chapters and ultimately how many pages your finished book will be that 's because these settings roughly translate to a printed book page it 's also the format that assessors editors publishers and competitions also want to receive their manuscripts so it 's just good housekeeping to start out this way from the very beginning the only time i 'd suggest doing another format is when you print out your novel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this as a final step as a writer reading on paper is a very different experience to reading on a screen because you 're less tempted to edit and change things as you read but still keep a pen in hand to make um notes but it means you can 't rewrite a whole passage which i often do then when you go back and you re-read the pen notes and the margins there 's another opportunity to just sit in that moment and think if it 's really necessary to make that change or think how you change the words now that you 've just finished finished rereading the whole novel in printed form so before printing it off i 'd shuffle the line space down to single spacing and possibly reduce the text size just to reduce the cost of printing and the weight of having to carry it around and i think most newspapers and magazines use about an eight or a nine point type size so it 's not that small um if you 're used to reading magazines and things but my one big tip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day or after every change i 'm a belt and braces and buttons and safety pins type of person i don 't trust technology so i would never only ever have one copy of my manuscript um on a hard drive or even just one in the cloud each day um or each time i do a chunk of writing i email the document to two email addresses one 's a gmail and the other 's an icloud that 's how cautious i am as well as a backup in the cloud and then sometimes when i shut down for the day i also um back up on my laptop to an external drive okay so let 's go on to self-editing um i seem to have two types of writing days one day i 'll go in with no idea what i 'm going to write and just sit down and write scrappy disjointed stuff until i hit my word target and actually i 'll just backtrack a bit there um i have a word target as my writing time motivation i don 't do two hours or four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a word o 'clock so when i hit my word o 'clock that 's when i stop so honest i 'm one of my scrappy writing days i know i 'm i 'm going to need to self-edit a lot the next time i read that section but i still just keep going to get my word count and i 'll worry about fixing the scrappy writing another time the other type of writing day i have is when i have a specific scene to write or specific set of events to describe on those days i 'm more focused on writing that part of the story and i have a clearer idea of what 's happening so i find my writing quality is better if it that it needs less editing the next time i read it and by better i mean it flows more easily from one paragraph to the next but on those days there 's also a trade-off i found that technically the writing might have a better flow but i 've also found that sometimes the story is not emotional enough it provides the functional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do but then during self-editing or re-reading i have to inject a bit more emotion into it so that 's sort of like a bit of a trade-off uh but generally most writers seem to be one or the other of these two types um there 's a there 's a lot of two types going on in this conversation but but um in reality there 's sort of lots of degrees or combinations of these types but but generally writers seem to either like to just get um get it on the page as quickly as possible and worry about the exact words and storyline the next time they read it or they are very deliberate about each sentence and each scene and therefore they write more carefully the first time round i think either way um you will always still need to self-edit and by this i don 't mean anything big or structural at this stage i just mean editing the words that you 've written um the first and really only the first and only job of a self editor is to make sure a reader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to show them using jargon or complicated or fancy words will usually reduce your audience and reduce your readership i 'm not a creative writing graduate or writing academic as most authors seem to be these days i 'm a very practical writer from a working writing background a daily writing background and i know almost instantly when i read a novel if someone has been overtaken by their creative writing course in my opinion overly descriptive writing is a big turn off and it distracts from the story and the characters the same goes um for an author who is box ticking to include certain plot points or story arcs because that 's what a teachers told them to do so my best self editing tip is to use simple and less words see if you can rewrite your page or chapter without any adjectives then go back and reward yourself with three or four important descriptions i 've also included a list of my favorite editing and self-editing and writing books in a reference sheet which you can download after tonight okay so on to um paying for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written a novel before i didn 't really know what i was doing so after my second draft i paid for a manuscript assessment this really opened my eyes i was really pleased with the feedback and it helped me polish my manuscript into the final version which i then entered into a competition the assessment was through a writing organization and i think it cost about seven hundred dollars it was a reasonable amount of money but because i was working and i had a regular income at that time i felt the cost was worthwhile and and after um getting the report back i was really pleased with spending the money i thought it was good value the report was about five pages and it highlighted the good bits and the bad and it was the it was the best feedback i 've ever had and as a beginner it really set me on the right track most of the comics were comments were general nothing too specific about how to write or how to tell a story but it pointed out some really interesting things and i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that were showing up um i 'd left the main story for too long when i took the reader to a subplot it was one of the really important points the assessor thought that two of my characters were too similar to each other the novel fell a bit flat in the middle which is very common and known as the middle muddle there was interesting there was also too much swearing my story included morphies and truckies and journals but sometimes realistic dialogue can be too real she said the most value i got from the assessment was the criticism it 's very rare and difficult to find honest opinions when it comes to writing because most people don 't want to offend you if you show it to a friend they 'll love it no matter what um even within writing groups um it 's off people are often reluctant to point out the bits that they 're not keen about and believe me there are always those bits and but for me all i ever wanted to know from an editor or assessor is where it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the earlier question my attitude has changed about that now um now that my book is published once you 're published there 's a there 's a whole world of nasty comments and trolls full of unhelpful criticism um but you just have to brace yourself um with the knowledge that an agent a publisher an acquisitions team and editing team and all the bookstore owners who stopped your book have already judged a novel to be good enough you still need a really thick skin compared with an assessor an editor does a more detailed job an editor will actually go in and talk about the structure of the story the timeline of including or removing information the potential development of a character also plot or even suggest a whole new theme um as an extra element to the novel an editor will also comment on the emotional aspects of your story the growth of a character and the way information is revealed and they 'll also usually make notes and markups on the manuscript about potential solutions and an editor will also take a big picture view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received in the um and positioned in the marketplace some editors will also act like semi agents and they have connections with publishing houses or even refer your manuscript to agents or publishers but i think that 's more common with international editors not so much in australia but there 's plenty of international editors that you can hire and work with so don 't think you only need to look in your immediate marketplace for an editor i didn 't hire an editor i thought my manuscript assessment was enough for me and i only had a few weeks before my deadline but i know several authors who have hired private editors with mixed results unfortunately a professional editor can seem quite harsh if you 're sensitive about your work and sometimes that puts authors off and maybe makes them disregard everything the editor has suggested which of course is the writer 's choice but from my experience of working with editors in newspapers and magazines and within my own publishing house each editor also has a really different view about the writing each editor likes one bit more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's always a balancing a balancing act for the author to decide how much of an entities editor 's advice they 're going to take on [Music] cost wise i think a private editor can be several thousands of dollars i know one 80 000 word manuscript which the writer considered to be a final draft um so it was already in the best shape she could make it the cost for editing was about four thousand dollars um but most of the suggestions and the work the editor did were not taken up by the writer and she submitted the manuscript to a couple of publishers pretty much as it was um so for her she didn 't think it was worthwhile um but also that manuscript is still unpublished so you know who knows why that happens um competitions so just quickly on the subject of competitions this is by far the best way to get noticed by an agent and a publisher being shortlisted for a writing competition is a um a big feather in your cap it means at least four or five experienced authors publishers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the heap and believe me there is a heap out there a heap that never gets read publishers often don 't even read the first page of a manuscript if the synopsis or cover letter doesn 't grab them and usually that 's no fault of the writer or the story but it could be that there are just too many similar novels around at the time or that that publisher or that agent doesn 't handle books of that genre or that type in my case i set myself a deadline to write a manuscript and time to enter the victorian premieres literary awards um for an unpublished manuscript all up i had about excuse me all up i had about nine months um from when i decided to write a novel but because i couldn 't write every day on the days that i could write i had to um i had to set myself a word target of um 2000 words a day don 't freak out about that that is high most of my writing days i couldn 't start until about 9 or 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting on my knees and often i 'd be awake till all hours of the morning sometimes no sleep at all and i just get out of bed take my daughter to school and then take myself off to work so i met my word count which was about 70 000 words i got my manuscript assessment back um about three weeks before the award deadline i quickly made the changes i wanted and i entered the award and luckily i was one of three shortlisted it 's a very short short list for that award often shortlists can be ten or five or eight um it just depends uh i 've just been judging this year 's david awards for crime writing and some other short shortlists for each category are eight and some are some are three and everything in between although i didn 't win the unpublished manuscript award that year the winner was christian white uh with his manuscript for the nowhere child and i tease him now every time i see him he stole my award but being shortlisted meant i had publishers and agents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided to go with an agent curtis brown because i was brand new to this novel writing and because an agent would then put the manuscript out for auction to all the publishers and to me this meant i could then um judge between the various offers and get sort of a more accurate idea of of what the real value um they saw in mod in the novel um from the office we chose a two book deal with simon schuster and i 've just finished the main draft of the second book and that 's with the publisher now and i 'm waiting for some initial feedback on that and then i 'll go on and do a third draft um so just to reinforce the value of competitions i think for both agents and publishers they like them because it reduces the risk of taking a chance on a new writer and they have big financial investment in a new writer so i 'd encourage everyone to look for a competition or award to enter and i 've um on the reference sheet i 've included some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things that are coming up so that 's that bit uh that 's all i 've got to talk about on that bit and um let 's just open up i think we 're pretty almost close to the end of um our time so how about we just open up the questions to those last topics and also to anything else you wanted to talk about i know originally i was hoping to talk about whether you should get an agent or free wheel and how you find a publisher and a little bit about self-publishing and so if you wanted to ask questions about those things let 's let 's do it that way too yeah okay we 've got a few questions that have popped up karina all right once the first draft was done how many drafts did you complete until you first gave it to the editor um so i did my story is a little bit dif different because i went through a competition so i did two drafts of my manuscript and then entered that into the competition and then when my manuscript @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drafts with the publishers input so all together um two drafts on my own and with my assessor and two drafts with the publisher and the publishers editors so four drafts for me but often i ask this question a lot of other authors often i ask um them how many drafts they do before they hand it in to their publishing house and it ranges from one which is like unbelievable two um i was just talking to um an author this morning too and she does about four or five drafts sometimes six or seven yeah wow okay so it varies yeah and then the editors and um or the publishing director or your editor will also make suggestions and there 'll be another drafting process with that as well you were talking earlier about paying to get your manuscript read one of our totally agrees with you it 's the best feedback that they got oh that 's great to hear oh good so is that something that you would encourage writers to do yeah i would um because as i say your friends and your writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion and you need a and all also sometimes it 's a bit like the blind leading the blind you know if you 're a new writer you don 't know um everything yet you know and and you your fellow emerging writers the new writers don 't know everything yet but the assessments are usually done by really experienced authors and um they 've got a good idea of um structure and um how to um market a novel because ultimately you have to you do have to have an audience you know you do have to find a publisher um so i would definitely recommend an assessor do you have some manuscript assessment services that you could um give us the links to yeah i 've put in the reference um sheet i 've put in a couple of writing organizations and i think every one of them um will link you into a manuscript assessor now you talked earlier about your word o 'clock yes what is your word o 'clock word count for um for that first novel where the truth lies it was 2 000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult circumstances because i couldn 't write every day for the second manuscript that i 've just finished i started out um as a word o 'clock of 1 500 words a day and that was every day that was you know seven days a week and after about a week i changed it to a thousand words a day and then after about two months i changed it to 500 words a day so it sort of got smaller and smaller as my energy sort of was used up with sort of thinking because the more you write the more you have to recall and think how is it all going to fit into the big picture so that sort of slowed my writing down a bit so it but in the end it went down to 500 words a day now you were talking before about um the synopsis grabbing the attention uh have you got any tips on writing a synopsis yeah it 's a really hard one um because i had an agent um my agent sort of almost wrote the synopsis with me um so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of having an agent but um the synopsis has got to there 's two schools of thought so you need to tell the whole story about what the novel is about so that the publisher can decide if they 're interested or not so generally don 't sort of leave them dangling or trying to tease them about the story or try to create mystery or anything usually you really do have to lay it out about the beginning the middle and the end of your story and and what themes are in it so because the synopsis only goes to um professional people either to an agent or a publisher um you don 't you 're not it 's not a sales document as such it 's not um trying to entice you to buy the book or create a mystery for someone to want to find out the answer to it really has to be quite a serviceable synopsis you know telling the person about the main characters the main themes and the main clock through the story so i would just sort of play it with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it we 've got a question here um your book is set in melbourne and when you read it it is it is lovely to read because you can picture the places that are mentioned in it because they 're familiar how important is writing about the place you know i think it 's important um [Music] not all authors do a lot of authors um write about places i 've never been to um or don 't know very well but for me i wanted to ground it in a city i wanted to have a place an identifiable place and the city almost becomes a character within the story it 's good for people who know the city but it 's also got to be um honest and truthful enough so that people um who only know one or two things about melbourne like they may only know that um you know the mcg is in melbourne um something will register with them that that 's oh that 's a truthful um description of uh that place and so therefore they even if they don 't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ author that if that one thing that they know is truthful then all the other things in the about place and about atmosphere and culture um that you include in your book um is truthful as well so do you have a particularly australian view do you think in your writing i don 't know i don 't think so um i read a lot of australian writers but i read i read writers from all around the world and i grew up in new zealand um i don 't know um that 's a really hard one for me to answer i 'm not sure so maybe someone else could decide [Laughter] now if we have if anyone has any more questions please send them through right now um it is 7 30 but karina has already mentioned to us prior that she 's happy to continue and answer any other questions that you might have whether or not it 's related ah here 's one for you when 's your next book due um well that 's a another covered saga unfortunately so it was due out um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the second one was due out in about march next year but because all the publishers of a lot of the publishers have set back their um timelines so there 's sort of like a little bit of a backlog building and so i haven 't been informed yet but i imagine that that will mean that all those publication schedules are all going to be um set back as well so all i can say is next year at this at this time hopefully um in the first half of the year and that 's another um chrissy o 'brien investigation so chrissy 's still at the argus um in melbourne and the argus for those who don 't know um was a newspaper in melbourne and if it was still going it would be possibly the oldest newspaper in australia and in the middle of melbourne there 's a building that the argus built and named after itself and that building is still there and i really i love that building and i love architecture and i love melbourne for that reason but i love that building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to have those journalists back in that building working in a modern day situation and so that 's why i chose the argus and and the argus is actually in that building now going back to the very beginning how do you plan the opening chapter um it depends what type of book you 're writing i don 't know if the questioner has got a chance to maybe update that question and say what type of book they 're writing but i would still regardless of the genre i would still start with something that really makes a big impression it really makes somebody care as i was saying before you need to care about turning the page turning the next chapter and so you can care for all sorts of reasons you can care because something is sad or something is really exciting or there 's a murder or um you know just because it 's um just because you need to know what happens to the character so it comes back to that word care you have to make people care about your character i think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big explosion at all but um it 's very even though it 's a crime novel it 's very much a character novel it it 's a it 's a crime novel but it 's about um the character as much as it is about the plot and the um and the crime yes yeah well it opens on the dock yeah the girls screaming yeah yeah yeah so that 's quite a that 's quite a lyrical opening and i 'm i i often write quite um lyrical sentences sometimes i go against everything i 've said about get rid of those adjectives or else i just throw them into you know a couple of little sentences which i just love so the girls um screaming and wheeling i i could that was a um a scene i 've stood in many times you know visiting the docks and standing on the dock says i 've felt that scene it was um it 's in my blood that scene so to me that was um a really strong starting point for me as a writer and hopefully um it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find out now you talk did talk about adjectives but what about adverbs oh well yes they 're banned as well sorry not allowed nothing to see here move on [Laughter] um you mentioned that um you know uh that at the moment with corona you know sort of things have been shifted back in time do you think that um is that a reflection that perhaps it 's getting harder to get published um at the moment i think um i think it 's getting harder anyway even without um this pandemic um actually book sales during international book sales during the pandemic have um gone up slightly i think that um globally and i think that might be steady or just very small amount down in australia but overall globally i think book sales are going up i think people are recognizing the value of reading and escaping from this world you know and that 's what books do they let us escape into somebody else 's world and someone else 's story but i think generally getting published by a traditional publisher is getting harder because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profits are being squeezed and so they take less risk they um you know they really try to narrow down as much of the risk as possible and that often means that they won 't take a chance with a new writer or an unusual writer i read a book recently it was almost like a stream of um consciousness i think you describe it as and i was really surprised that it was published by a mainstream publisher because it 's a risk to take with that sort of book um you know because it has a you either love it or hate it and and if anything you don 't want a lot of people to hate your book because then the publisher is is landed with the cost of um having printed it but self-publishing is um an option and there are a lot of people self-publishing from i 'm not a fan of self-publishing and that 's probably because i 've seen a lot of people get ripped off by self-publishers the cost can be really high i saw an author friend proposal um she received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she would pay 22 000 to have um her book published through the self publisher and that would include them doing the distribution and marketing but that 's an awful lot of money and they 're really a lot of self-publishers are just creating a cash flow for themselves and once they receive their fee please all the self-publishers don 't don 't harass me don 't troll me but a lot of them um will receive their money and they 've received their money so you know the outcome or the sales of the book aren 't that important to them anymore they 've been paid for their part of the job by the author but of course for an author you want to get your story read that 's more important than anything and you need people to buy your book and to read it you know so i don 't know how the sales of um self-published books are measured i haven 't actually there are lots of um statistics in the industry that measure book sales but i 'm not sure um how self-published book sales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have heard i 've got a friend who 's a romance writer she makes a lot of money through self-publishing and she arranges the distribution itself so there 's a lot of um success stories i think if you 're going down the road of self-publishing you need to do a lot of research first and and get some um talk to experienced people and get some feedback about the type of deal you can expect and the type of cost and just how who 's going to manage the distribution what networks can they sell the books through are they you know do they have a relationship with a book chain or a big online store or um local independent books all that sort of information i 'd have to narrow it down really good before i went in that direction that 's some great advice there one more question for you karina do you see a future screenplay of the first book i 'd love that um i do i could see like i 'm i 'm keen for so sort of like a woman who 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sleuth you know i think journalists are sleuths i think we have to have a lot of the skills that um detectives have and i like the added complication that i gave my character and that i felt as a journalist myself that to ask questions you have no legal standing on or no right to ask anyone a question you really have to rely on your relationship that you 've built up with your contact or or their or your good will or your professionalism to get people to answer questions so it 's sort of like an added complication for my investigative sleuth um that she has no powers to um compel people to answer her questions so i like that as an extra hurdle for her to try and get over and i could see that working um working on a tv series let 's put that around shall we that 's great that 's great thank you so much karina a lot to think about um i 'm just going to do a little bit of a plug for your book right now um this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this available at our library as you can see down here and we actually have quite a few new editions making their way to our library so jump online onto our catalog and reserve your copy we also have it available as a e-resources as well so um i 've read it and um i actually really love the main character um very quirky i do i really like it if you if you can 't wait you can also purchase a copy and support of course um and i 'm happy to tell you that the sun book shop is actually delivering so there 's another option for you as well but i do recommend you pick a copy of it and read it i mean thank you for um being part of our very first um uh writer 's workshop hopefully we 'll have more actually i 'll just tell you a little um story and before we go um the book is also um available as an audio book and so i had to audition the voice um for chrissy and i never even thought about having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five um and so the voices for the audio books are like full-on professional um actors so i had to audition by listening to four or five women actors and narrow it down to the one that i thought was the most appropriate but i also then had to write a a little description of each character so that she could the actor whose name is megan smart she 's a young aussie actor based in sydney and so she could get into the sort of slight nuances of the other characters and one of the um sort of descriptions i gave was of skinny who 's for those who haven 't read skinny skinny as a cat in the book who 's quite a main character and i had to give a description of how skinny would speak because i wanted her to be able to put on skinny swagger when she spoke about him and you know sort of move the way that skinny would move when she was talking about skinny so that was a fabulous experience i didn 't even know that sort of thing existed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just so that you know karina we 've got a lot of messages here saying thank you very much for for sharing and being so open about your process and your journey and giving so many practical tips along the way so once again thank you all very much and we hope that this will help you in your own journey um with your own writing journey um we do have writer 's groups at our libraries so you can jump online and look at our website and get in contact with us about those and um we wish you all the very best and keep safe everyone yeah good luck everyone and keep writing yeah and thanks very much for jumping online yeah yeah you see you all thank you bye-bye"

meeting at various places on the islands of the cooling nation and pay our respect respects to the traditional custodians of the lands and to ancestors and elders past and present we are committed to honoring australian aboriginal and torres strait islander people 's unique cultural and spiritual relationship to the land waters and seas and their rich contribution to society welcome to our libraries at home event what a wonderful way to celebrate the first day of spring just a couple of housekeeping notes before we begin please keep your microphones on mute throughout the session this evening this avoids any feedback or unnecessary background noise alice and bruno do welcome questions so if you have any questions please post them in the chat function and we will get to them if we can you can also post any comments in the chat function and please address them to everyone now many of you know alice and bruno @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was born in footscray a month after her parents arrived in australia many of you will have read alice 's work unpolished gem or seen her recent essay in the ngv magazine the art that changed me bruno of bruno goes everywhere fame was born in referendum in southern italy he is a well-known host and has interviewed many authors over the years including alice a couple of times before he was a lecturer at victoria university and began the rotunda in the west interview series it is my great pleasure to introduce alice in conversation with bruno ellis we alice we 've done a few twirls on the on the dance floor of conversation do you get tired of it you go no i won 't understand truly truly it 's an unusual time for a young mom you 're there in your parents house at the moment because of the covert thing and the kids are probably just a bedroom away is it easy to slip into that into that zone where you have to talk about everything and everything um well it 's it 's just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone knows everyone 's been in lockdown for for many weeks and i am uh i 'm eight months pregnant at the moment so usually i live at a college called janet clark hall which is part of the university of melbourne so i mentor some students there sometimes i teach them creative writing but the principal just told me the college was not probably the safest not the safest place for someone who was pregnant so we moved in with my parents um after we had a short stint with nick 's parents because they live in the countryside so that was wonderful for the boys um yeah so we 're living in a big extended family there 's lots of pandemonium going on in the background which is why my background setting is this lovely poem that bruno sent me so even during the pandemic um we write to each other bruno and i have been friends for oh a decade would you say bruno well that was going to be my actually my opening question yes my thunder a little bit alice but i 'm very delighted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a decade started to host the all begin the rotunda in the west series and you were the first writer as well as some writers from the university and someone said you need to get this alice porn person she 's just written a book about growing up in footscray so we did but since that time alice you 've gone on to write her father 's store her father 's daughter you 've gone on to write the novel larinda you 've written the john marston book you 've done a truckload of kind of articles and everything did you have any idea when you were that young student on that stage of vu when you were a young writer i should say and not even a mum that that all of this was ahead of you was there some massive kind of burning desire within you to to build this enormous collection of writing and tell stories about the west um oh bruno to be honest no i was just a bit um shell shocked to be honest after my first book because it came out while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out recently by an even younger writer vivian pham called the coconut children which she wrote when she was 16. she 's she 's a genius because i 've interviewed her before but i thought 25 um i remember going to literary festivals and just being one of the youngest people there because at that time there weren 't that many younger writers and not many young writers um from a working class background and from a um you know an asian australian background so it was a it was a lonely time to be honest and it took me at least um maybe five to seven years before there was a whole collective of younger writers mainly that came out of growing up asian in australia the anthology and then this this massive push for diversity that started in the states so now i feel like i have so many more colleagues um who are either of my age or my background or or people i can um you know relate to but the wonderful thing that happened those all those years ago is i got a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me and who ended up being mentors and you ended up being the godfather of our kids you know so unexpected things happened with that vu session all those years and friends and as yeah i i could be your father and what is it with you and seeking older people as friends you have a poncho for that a little bit don 't you um i grew up with my grandmother we shared the same bed for the first eight years of my life i 'm really lucky my sons um are surrounded by their grandparents it 's so interesting i read this in article in the guardian about you know in lockdown you can visit your intimate partner now an intimate partner could be someone you met for three times on tinder and yet you really can 't visit your best friend even though they 've been isolating or the rules don 't extend to your sister who might be the cleanest person because she works in a hospital and takes proper precautions so it 's interesting what we consider um in our culture and our current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you negotiated this this kind of strange period that someone called it um a liminal phase a kind of phase like we 're in this perpetual aircraft and you know how strange that kind of is have you done things differently or have you gone no i 've got my poetry i 've got my books i 've got obviously my kids my work my beloved husband but but has there been something strange happening within you that has allowed you to be either more creative or less creative alice that 's an excellent question bruno and i know some people have it rough some of my friends have lost their jobs in hospitality but as a writer your job is anywhere you go so i 've been very lucky and i 've been lucky that um a lot of writers have an introverted personality so i 've been really productive actually living at home my parents don 't on the grandkids i 've been able to finish writing a children 's book with an illustrator um coming out soon isn 't it oh not not soon but you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on zoom about it with publishers i 've been lucky to finish a young adult book in that time and i 've just been lucky to be able to get all this rest um while growing a baby because my previous pregnancies i was dropping kids off at child care at school and getting a a lot of doing a lot of running about and and just to be able to sit still really has an effect on ideas if you 're running around a lot and your concentration is in short spurts it 's like you have a cup of muddy water and you 're shaking it up all day and the only time it settles is at night all the all the mud goes to the bottom and the water becomes clear but by then you 're too tired to write anything you fall asleep and i 've been able to sit with my thoughts for longer than half an hour stretches at a time so it 's been a really good period i 've been very lucky um christos told person in an article he wrote during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not a married man obviously and but he he was saying i 've got all this time but he felt like this stagnation had set him and in fact if he realized through that how much he he missed friendship and how stimulating friendship was in the whole creative process you 're always very generous alice when you you launch your books you you talk about the ensemble of people who who create that kind of space for you in which to write can you talk a little bit about that and how important that is because we view writing as a solitary kind of thing don 't we oh we we certainly do um and i 'd like to just say writing isn 't my day job actually i 've been working in the public services as long as i 've been a writer so for about 15 years i work at the fair work commission so i i 've just gone on maternity leave from that but that that is important just to give me perspective because writing is really um it 's really insular it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you you can spend years and years it took me four years to write my last book because i had kids and was really busy so um to have that job where you 're seeing people in the outside world your colleagues and your friends and you 're not the center of the universe and you 're not creating a universe you 're part of a team that hopefully helps um you know helps people it really um that shapes my writing and then to be part of the larger community of college where you pass on hopefully some things you you know about writing to students and then to be part of the larger community than that because you know um helen garner spent seven years in the law courts didn 't you writing house she did yeah i can imagine i can 't imagine that feat being possible within the context of you know all the pulls on your life as they are the working the mothering the you know the rushing round it appears to me that you have to create this very sh small little kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go fairly feverishly that that seems to make it all the more remarkable to me oh thanks bruno you i mean there 's i know there 's a lot of mothers and grandmothers here you know you only get scraps of time when you 're a mum or when you 're working mum so um it 's it has affected my writing when i wrote my book her father 's daughter i was 30 years old i was not yet married i had all the time in the world to explore big ideas like genocide holocaust what it means to be a daughter what it means to be a father and now if i have 30-minute stretches of time my my thoughts are more um concentrated i 'm not i wouldn 't call myself a poet but it 's almost the way a poet works you have a shelf and every single object you put on that shelf has to have have a purpose there otherwise it 's just cluttering space you know so that that 's how i work now whereas before i was one of those writers who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know discard the ones i didn 't need now i almost have to tweeze words into place with the limited time and and that 's actually changed my voice you 're back at your mum 's house you you 're a different daughter to the daughter who left when you were i don 't know 20 or so um and you 're a daughter that brings her own children that happens to change enormously the whole dynamic within an asian family tell us tell us about that and and tell us about how you negotiate the way they used to fret a lot because of their experiences you know in the killing fields but i imagine you you you deal with that whole lot differently now oh to be honest bruno my parents still fret a lot um but they fret about the grandkids so they 're scared of the grandkids falling down they 're scared of the grandkids getting run over all the same fears but just with with my son what do you do do you you know let them be they 're mine or yep look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time i 'm just so grateful that i 'm not the one fretting i 'm not the one with these fears i i 'm not the one stressing because i 've got friends who are first-time mothers or who live in you know the them their partner and the kids and and they 're anxious all the time because they have to do all that worrying whereas i think oh my parents have taken this huge load off me they 're the warriors in this family i 'm the chill mom you know and i know when i move back um into my normal routine when this virus hopefully dies down i 'm going to be the one fretting about them falling downstairs because we live in a college so i i 've been given a great gift the other thing i 've been given living here is a sense of perspective you know people um because because if you 're an artist and a writer sometimes you 'll have you 'll be on facebook and writers will say how hard life is but you know my parents survived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home you can watch netflix how 's that compared to having a gun in your hands and shooting people when you 're 18. so if this is the worst thing that people have survived sitting at home watching netflix getting bored um i don 't know if you wrote her father 's daughter which is which is you going and interviewing people who survived that that asian holocaust you were 30 i i sincerely think that i would have to live maybe 10 lifetimes before i think i would be anywhere near prepared enough to be able to to even be able to receive the gravity of those stories it 's a huge mountain that you climbed early um i guess so bruno but i was well prepared just because um it 's a different experience you grow up with parents who survived and half the family died and i think i related a lot to jewish holocaust survivors one of my good friends arnold staple again a writer much older than myself we have this connection just because of that so i grew up ever since i was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five years old you 'd be around the dinner table and my dad would oh my mom might say remember needle because everyone had a nickname back there she was so good with that singer sewing machine and the next line would be my dad would say yeah too bad they smashed her so every time you heard they smashed him or they smashed her or they smashed here you know little kids you knew they were killed in a very brutal way so i grew up with these um stories so i don 't think ago this is too enormous this is beyond the scope of being able to be processed in any meaningful way just the very art of you being able to listen tell us about the art of listening when you 're sitting beside someone who has gone through unimaginable kind of acts of evil perpetrated on them oh that 's a that 's an excellent question sometimes people don 't tell you because they 're too close to you so my father never told me the stories um in detail except there 's funny stories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was starving the belt you wear around your waist because he thought that leather would um was a skin of an animal and he said he watched the charlie chaplin film where charlie chaplin ate his boots or something or a hat so he told them in a way that that was appropriate when we were you know nine or ten um but as an adult i couldn 't get the stories of him um when i was in my twenties just because i was his daughter and he didn 't want to tell me horrors from war but when i went overseas for the first time um on an asia link residency we had these long phone calls and because he didn 't see me face to face that 's when he started to open up so i was just a an error in you know on a telephone line um so sometimes the closeness you have to someone you love a lot uh brings in yourself editor now everyone has a self editor you don 't need to be a writer when i interview people the moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ editor kicks in so you 've just got to um you 've got to loosen that up a bit alice you most recently wrote a piece which which i think was the the motivation for kerry to say let 's get alex she saw the the article it was a an in-response piece it was for a a a magazine that wanted you to nominate a piece of art that it could move you that have meant something special to you tell us about the the painting that you selected and what it is you learned out of that experience of responding to to a magnificent piece of art oh okay so so it was a piece for the national gallery of victoria and i picked john brack 's um collins street i think um 1955. now that 's a really obvious painting everyone who goes to the ngv remembers that or the banquet of cleopatra but the banquet of cleopatra was taken by another author my very talented friend peggy fru so i i really um it was one of the earliest pictures i remember i remember being 15 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is where literature on a postcard size postcard size and i and it 's just reproduced so often it 's become a sort of cliche but then when i got my first office job in the city um i went to the gallery by myself one day and i saw the painting in all its full magnitude it 's magnificent it 's huge and people yeah it 's it 's enormous it 's the heads are bigger than your own almost and you know everyone writes about this painting being so monotonous and dreary and if you go down collins street today they 're all wearing black they 're exactly the same but you look at each of the faces and they 're just people lost in thought and you know one man looks like he 's even whistling the the two ladies secretaries um have secret smiles i thought these are people who who have inner lives very rich in their lives and so that 's why i wrote about this painting which has always been misconstrued as monotoly and you realize that made those who write in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the definitive perspective like you came to your own view of it and you saw the smiles on some of the faces and the ironic looks oh yeah because i was one of those workers bruno and i was um my own perspective is i was the first to make it into a city office in my family that was a huge deal you know for for some people it 's routine you follow your dad into insurance but you know for most of my growing up i had family friends who were missing fingers because they were cutting things with meat cleavers who had their arms sewn up because they got them caught under sewing machines who wore nothing but polyester and cotton because they were the materials they worked with and to be going home on at collins street at 5 p.m and see all these people dressed like me in their finery i thought wow i 've made it alice you love red don 't you oh yeah i love red yep you 're quoting that article um bob dylan uh but i was so so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking of all your literature of all the stories of what we just talked about of you witnessing the stories of the holocaust through your beloved family that i suspect that 's true i reckon you 're going younger as you get older i think you were born old because you have this huge responsibility like my sister who was 14 and doing income tax for all the working class italians oh i remember that story about your sister lisa yeah it 's a huge huge thing do you feel that and with your own young kids around you and the inevitable you know kind of energy and bounciness of this that you might be pushing away some of that that specter of of the the killing fields and that and finding your chance just to be thinking about going down to williamstown beach and ruffling the water 's edge or something yeah we we do that quite a bit when when it 's not locked down um that 's a wonderful bob dylan quote because it also says a lot about younger writers so you know it 's about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i i do a lot of writing workshops of younger writers i remember being 17 so i made exactly the same mistake you think that you need to sound like a middle-aged white man you need to sound like charles dickens to to have anything sophisticated or interesting to say and over the years um i 've stripped that back i 've tried not to sound like anyone except myself so this is reminds that enormously about you she says you you are stripped back there 's no embellishment you you know how to just kind of pick what 's there how do you learn that that again that that 's a mature thing i 'm i 'm still learning the whole this is more thing i i have to stop myself kind of gushing all the time you seem to have learned it early oh i i don 't know i just probably don 't have that many words in person but also i 've been very lucky at this time bruno australian publishing is um you know there 's this cliche you can 't be what you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know very middle-class very middle-aged man then i don 't think i would have the same voice or i would use the same voice but we 've got as you mentioned christos teokurst we 've got um melissa lukashenko who won the miles franklin award for for a book that is um takes a bit of getting used to the first few chapters because it 's you know she 's got an indigenous voice and a lot of it is slang and we 've accepted that a book like that can win the miles franklin so the the diversity of the english language and the way it 's exploded through indigenous writers vivienne fam the you know vietnamese australian writer christos is greek it 's just greatly enriched um enriched our culture you say um in your book where you you 've written this this shortish novella to john to john marston i was going to say john clark sorry um one you kind of write it as a letter tell us why you chose to write it as a letter and two tell us how daunting is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you who 's had a profound influence on you how do you stop not kind of making it had your hagiography rather than a genuine attempt to say this is who i see oh well um i think much of it has to do with uh meeting john because of you bruno you you brought john to the western suburbs to sunshine tafe in particular many years ago it was the first time i met john martin who i 'd read since i was a teenager now he 's always accused of having dark themes in his books themes are not appropriate for young adults like the tomorrow when the war began series but me and my mates in bray brook we devoured those books because a lot of my friends survived the war that was the experience like oh this guy writes about us he even had an asian character in there um lee takum who was not a cliche of any asian character he was just his own man and so i met john um in sunshine tafe this hallowed world famous author eating a sandwich wearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when when you see the people uh you 've admired for so long in real life who come and visit you but anyhow he and we 've established a friendship now over the years because becoming his um you know his colleague at writers festivals he 's full of no nonsense he 'll tell teachers off if they 're taking too much time um or if they 're being you know being rude to kids he 's because he was he 's a principal himself but what what 's so one of the most um wonderful things about john was he taught me an important lesson about parenthood and this is before his parenting book came out he said oh look most people say the most important thing is to love your kids and that 's a given um but he says love can be manifested in all sorts of horror you know terrible ways says it 's really important to like your kids and i thought that that 's true that 's true most people love their kids some people don 't like spending time with their kids some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yeah so so it was easy to write an honest book about him because he 's he 's a guy um as was oscar wilde no ernest hemingway said it 's important for every writer to have a built-in detector and he has that he wouldn 't put up with a book that was all praised and you think you 've imbibed the detective from him or have you learned it from me i 'm not sure in equal you quote john green i think in one of the stories in close to home perhaps you say john green says writing is a profession for introverts who want to tell a story but don 't want to make eye contact while doing it is that you is that it 's fairly true about a lot of the writers i 've interviewed i can 't prove it i don 't have any analysis but i i think there 's a deep vein of shyness that runs through a lot of the writers i 've interviewed um that 's really true bruno writing and talking are very different things a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got a book in me you know because i can tell a good story but oral storytelling and writing is different telling a story is words writing is your thoughts so that 's why you can have writers like michelle prowse two sentences go on for whole paragraphs you know it 's like he has a full stop budget every 200 words he 'll put a full stop in and um yeah it reads perfectly and when you say his sentences are allowed they 're terrible sentences so writers are introverts and they 're not really um putting down what they 're saying they 're actually putting down what matters most they 're putting down their heartbeat or their thoughts and that 's how you can tell the difference between a story that 's in that narrative you know someone talking all the time or something that 's a bit more profound something that 's full of thoughts but you do both alice i i it 's my contention my very humble contention i i think i think there is that that self-effacing kind of quality to you because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sunday morning where your kids are running around and your word is kicking these most beautifully flighted kind of drop puns i get the feeling that you 're just really happy to be there and last thing i get the feeling is that you you want to have a chat on the boundary line about writing it 's extraordinarily grounded and it i get the feeling you don 't have to be always talking about your art in order to kind of be there i think you just seem to just love fronting up and merging into the thing that 's kind of happening there and rollicking around yeah i 've always believed writing isn 't about talking and the least productive writers i know are the ones i 'm sorry to say who try and do it full time and who talk about it all the time and who talk about how horrible it is not to get enough funding and you know things like that some of the most productive riders just get on with their lives because they know that their innermost thoughts come inspiration one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said look if i wrote when i was inspired i 'd write maybe twice a year it 's it 's actually you just got to sit down and do it and not talk about it you 've just got you got to do the writing so i live quite a busy life i like spending time with my family the more i talk crap on about writing the less i 'm doing it and the less time i 'm spending with my family so i guess i hope that answers the question honest i 've often wondered this and and i wonder whether it 's an even an answerable question but i i always feel i need to put you through your paces because um that 's what my job is but um can you give me a sense can you describe to me you you are in the middle of writing and it 's and it 's falling onto the page and you 're in the zone as sports people would say could you give them a sense on what that is like so being in the zone to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think you 're on to something and you think i think this is kind of working what is that feeling like oh i i don 't know to be perfectly honest bruno i 'm one of these writers um the zone doesn 't happen that often for me because i don 't have large stretches of time anymore feels good when it happens when you write whole pages or paragraphs but for me it 's paragraphs these days used to write whole pages but to be honest um one of the greatest gifts i cultivate is this sense of doubt because in the past i 've been in the zone i 've written 16 pages i 'm like i 'm such a legend this is so excellent you 've got to put it aside and then a month later i look at it and i think oh gosh this is just i 've just waffled on for 16 pages so um you 're feeling towards your writing and the the um the actual quality of it sometimes doesn 't correspond sometimes you 're in the zone because you 've been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids outside to do something um you feel quite happy that day sometimes you 're bloody miserable um you might have you know i i 've written through grief i 've written through extreme pain um you know half a migraine and some sometimes because i 've had to tweeze each word in place i go back over these pieces which aren 't necessarily about miserable things i think oh that 's that 's actually quite polished it 's only two paragraphs but it 's okay it 's good and sometimes when you 're really happy it might you 're not the best you know so so my writing isn 't guided by my feelings which is interesting is it is it a necessary compulsion that will have to stay with you all your life this writing or or could you at some point leave and say i kind of said the things i think i 've got to say and that 's enough i don 't know bruno um i guess my writing um physically doing the writing isn 't guided my my feelings but i guess what compels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't well always i never have an answer i never that 's um some writers sit down and they know exactly what they 're going to write i always sit down with a question that i need to answer and so that 's what guides my writing yeah and you 're a great fan of the poet les murray you actually when i put out a little call you know and i said to people you know um will you send me a poem you sent me a 1969 les murray poem why did you choose that and why was it important to you oh that 's a beautiful thing you did bruno during lockdown bruno asked all his friends to send him poems because bruno has about a hundred scrapbooks full of poems um and letters that his friends have written him so we we 've been friends and we 've been pen friends for as long as we 've been friends um and i thought of that les murray poem which is called i think it was called an ordinary rainbow wasn 't it bruno um it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no i picked it because i thought of you i thought of you and you um you openly weep in public at weddings and other events and i thought oh you know this is it 's a poem about the bustle it 's in martin place in sydney for those of you have been there people always rushing off to catch trains or doing things there 's this one man who 's just weeping in public and the only people who stop to look are the children and the seagulls i thought it was a wonderful poem so i i sent it to you i i loved it because you picked a poll from outside your kind of lifetime almost and it was and it wasn 't an asian kind of pole all of those kinds of things um you 're very surprising in those beautiful ways alice you once wrote me a letter from the airport you 're on your way to queensland or oh i don 't remember that there 's some beautiful kind of observations you make in the letter when i prepared for this i didn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go back to some of the more personal things that you 've done and written and gone look at look at the wonderful observations you start the letter d bruno i 'm writing to you from the melbourne airport as i wait for my flight to hopefully i can post this in tassie so you will have a letter from the island state when you return to your southeast asian home that 's a that 's an amazing thing to do i imagine a mother escaping her two kids and her husband and having a moment at an airport with a glass of wine might be more inclined to say i 'm going to just sit here in a thoughtless state and let the world go by why letters why have they been important to you and what do they do that that maybe some of the more formal kind of writings don 't do alice oh i i think some of my best writing is is in letters and it will never be published because letters are you know introverted people um aren 't very good at making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk emails you can make small because email helen garner says an email space is an infinite space you can write ten thousand words in an email a piece of paper um limits to you and helen garner says a postcard limits you even further so a postcard is a poem a letter is um a gift to someone you you um who is a friend of yours you know and you can say more in a letter sometimes than you can in real life to a person because you know i 'd never talk like that to you bruno here i am in the island state in 1901 i 'm told that there were about a half a million letters just been sent within the the state of victoria by daniel in a class like a handwritten one my students sigh if i dangle it to my friends as i 'm walking around queen and i go look what i got they sigh why don 't we write them anymore um i don 't know it takes effort to physically write one post it by a stamp it costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um and i think this new generation you grow up thinking letters of something um an obligation you have to do to your grandparents you know whereas before the internet we grew up without a wider knowledge of different countries so i was excited to get pen friends from around the world and um i have won katie since i was 14 and now we 've been friends for most of our lives and we visit each other five times sorry and she was at your wedding she was at my wedding and this came as a result of letters got another friend um in buffalo in the states who lived in a refugee camp along the thai burma border so i started writing to her and then she settled in the states so you you go through a person 's lifetime with them uh through letters it 's really important to me and that 's why lockdown is okay because i still write letters nothing 's changed my friends are still there my friend mary says to me bruno hey how are you coping and i always feel that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i 'm not trying to belittle the stress that this is caused not at all but i don 't have children i live alone and i keep saying i 've got my scrapbooks i 've got my pen i 've got my letter writing i 've got people sending them polls it felt like quite a rich life and in fact i felt that i i yearn for that interior-ness more because of the strangeness of the kind of predicament that we were at as a whole community do you did you do you do you sometimes go i 'm going to push back to that feeling of of strangeness by randomly setting a letter by randomly sending a poem by by randomly reading one it is this solace that we can get in tough times by going to these very very folkloric art forms i think there is definite solace um but you know if you 're completely alone you know people ask if writing has changed my life i guess it has but more importantly people have changed my life i write about people my works are character-based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you art doesn 't give you the companionship another human being or a pet does so we we we elevate uh we um we really care about its importance but to put it in perspective my mother can 't read all right she every week the the literature she reads at the safeway and bilo adds she lives a very rich life so i 've never been able to be the sort of writer that elevates the riding above all else yeah my father couldn 't ride at all but he could make beautiful gardens yeah um a change of pace alice and yeah tell me tell me the words in the english language that that you most love just just tell me three or four words in the english language that oh well i think joy is one of them um oh i don 't know brewing off the top of my head when um when i was leaving one of my jobs and you and your husband were there too and people had to go around the room and give a word each as a lovely tribute your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's a beautiful word i mean that describes him over there was passionate and enthusiastic and it was it was flattering to hear all of them it 's the word that has stuck most in my mind and it 's a very unsexy word steadfast steadfast isn 't he yes he is he is probably one of the reasons i married him among many um people thinking fastness oh you know people when you 're younger you have this idea of romance you think you 're an artistic person you 'll have to find another artistic person and passion will happen and things like that but there are better qualities like steadfastness and longevity and also um he gives me the space to think and that is so important the the mental space he 's just so calm for an artist to have someone so steadfast and calm it 's it 's a gift in your life you know i think the love grows every day it 's not one of those some romances are really passionate and um rocky we 've never been like that it suits me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that temperament john marston wrote a book everything i know about writing ellis ball i 'm going to put you on the spot for the sake of those who are in our audience and i suspect everyone who comes to an author talk or comes to a workshop i think surreptitiously they 're at home journaling away writing away rukuing away i think there 's some part of us all that would like to go i don 't need to be a writer in the big w sense of the word but but i do learn to be able to express my most innermost kinds of thoughts and convictions can i put you on the spot and i know you 've written a book called everything i know about writing imagine that you have just let the thoughts tumble out we 've only got a few minutes to go give us some advice on writing about someone you love oh writing about someone you love think about no one else reading it not even them because you can get self-conscious so that 's that 's the most important thing about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think they 're they 're mandatory for the soul letters because that they 're not conversations there 's something the how-to part of that alice how to write a letter i can 't i i look at the paper i pick up a pen i start with the deer carry and then i don 't know what to say what what what advice can you give them to tip them through that that terrible oh it depends who you 're writing to bruno and where they 're at if they 're lonely if their lives are full yeah it depends on the person sorry a diary oh that 's so important i 've kept a diary since i was eight not for some egotistical purpose of getting published or anything but just to vent when i was eight um at eight or nine you know my my siblings my younger sisters came along and suddenly i was um taking care of babies when i was not ready and my parents away said babies have very soft skulls and they trusted me with babies like seriously i would not trust an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i couldn 't unleash my anger you know i was like a single mom stuck in this concrete housing brave i was so angry i was such an angry kid um and i wrote diaries and sometimes the pen would go through the four pages because i was so mad one of the funniest entries was when my mum announced she was pregnant with my younger sister who i love dearly you know she she 's um got a special spot in my heart i was so angry like how dare they why didn 't they ask me before they did the deed because i thought i would be the one looking after her during school holidays and stuff and you read back on these old diaries of you being 11 and you being 12. and they 're funny um i 'd never publish them because they 're not good writing but they do inspire stories i have 27 spiral pads of letters that my wife and i wrote to each other i don 't know how to do with them what should i do with them should i should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my boys when they go uh dad you 're such an old fat there 's not a romantic you know kind of streak in your body should i should i get the evidence out and go look at these what should i do with them alice you should just keep them for your boys to find bruno they 're going to be embarrassed if you present them with your letters but i think they would appreciate them writing about your street alice i want my strengths my street i want to i want to write about bray brooke i want to write about that place which is most me and yet and yet we we shy away from that i suspect i think we think we have to go to to new york or london yes yeah about how we start the writing about that which is most familiar your book is called close to home home is is when you start a lot of your own isn 't it it is and it 's it 's um wonderful to see footscray when i 've traveled around the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books in alaska in a bookstore when you write close to home i think the best tip i can give you is just to see the extraordinary in in the very ordinary things in your life because they won 't be ordinary to someone reading it in midtown iowa or alaska so that 's what you 've got to do and the last question alice because i think we 've reached time is that right kerry yes bruno we have reached time um the finale i started alice with with the whole i met you 13 years ago and you weren 't a mother and you weren 't this and you didn 't have kids and you hadn 't written her father 's what do you know alice now that you didn 't know when i first met you what are the profound kinds of things that you know about the art of living the business of living now at the tender age of 39 um i know for certain that i know much less now with certainty than i did when i was 25 in writing so yeah and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lack of knowledge about the world it 's that bob dylan quote again isn 't it you expect less as you get older you expect more i just expect um anything to happen because anything can yeah i know your kids are ready for bed and they 've been really patient it 's been a joy again alice um this is the very last time i 'm ever going to interview you oh no that 's sad sorry i 'm just quiet what a cranky old man hello daniel hello oh he 's sorry he 's just causing a bit of mischief alice it 's been a joy thank you very much and give the boys a kiss for me okay oh thank you bruno thank you everyone um and it 's so wonderful to see familiar faces like susie and steve and suzette and angela you know i feel part of the community during lockdown we get paid for this and all our friends rock up like a paid reunion the world is good thanks alice you 're a joy to talk to thank you bruno and

create sounds and then we 're also going to have this cool little astronaut kind of floating through going to different environments you 'll find the full finished project in maribyrnong home coders our scratch studio but i 'm going to show you how to do the code from scratch for one of the better term today so we 're going to start by creating this little title here because it 's kind of cool to have a little bit of a title so we 've called this one a teleporting adventure where am i now so the idea is that this little sprite harper is floating around and being transported by anyone who 's using the project to different places and you can make them as crazy as you like so we might not do exactly the same as the project that 's already in clone coders but we 're going to have fun getting there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now we want everything to start when the green flag is clicked so let 's go to events and drag over our when green flag clicked code here and i always like to have a bit of a sound when something appears so i 'm going to start the sound pop i don 't know what it sounds like let 's have a listen yep i like that one that seems like a good sound and then we want it to appear so let 's drag a clock across the code sound and how long do we want it to appear [Music] maybe let 's say two seconds we don 't want it to be too long because we want to get into doing a little interactive game thing [Music] and then after that two seconds we want it to hide because we don 't want that teleporting adventure where am i now to appear there through the whole thing that would be kind of annoying [Music] and we 've got that bit of code in and we pretty much want to do the same thing for our other one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you don 't know this already if you want to have exactly the same code in another sprite you can drag it over to the other sprites and when the little i 'll do that again when the one that you want kind of wiggles i hope you saw it then i 'll do it one more time just so that you can see sprite 2 and wiggles yep there we go when it wiggles it means that that 's the one you 're dragging it into so if i click on sprite 2 we 've got the same code there we probably don 't want that sound there though i 'm going to drag that out because we 've already got our other sprite playing the sound so let 's click on the green flag and see if this is work [Music] yep we had our pop it showed up for two seconds then it 's disappeared that 's great now we can concentrate on everything else that we want to happen in the project so what about harper because we don 't want harper just standing there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do something and it 's kind of more fun if you 've got a character in a project rather than just pressing buttons and changing the backgrounds so let 's start with we 'll click on harper first that 's a good idea let 's start with the when green flag clicked and i reckon we might want to make harper a little bit smaller when she starts her little adventure so let 's set her size to 100 what i know i reckon when i 've created this i made it 60 let 's try that again yeah let 's set the size to 60 even better so now we want her to always go back to this position whenever the project starts because if we get her floating around and she goes to a different spot whenever we press stop she 's going to kind of end up you know over here or over there and it won 't look neat at the beginning each time so we 've got to make the code remember or make the project remember where she 's meant to be so let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her position so we want to go to and we 've got our position here already it defaults to having the position that the sprite is at at the time that you 're looking at this code and we also want her to point in a direction which is 90 degrees and it happens to be exactly where she is now so that means if she moves around so say if we move her here if we click that green flag she pops back right to where she should be and let 's pop [Music] and um now how about we wait two seconds or so before she does anything after the green flag is clicked because we want her to not move until that text disappears let 's make it let 's make it 2.5 seconds let 's give her just an extra half a second of sitting there before she starts moving now what do we want her to do we probably want her to sort of float around and we might want it to go a little bit smaller again i think so maybe we 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20 percent smaller [Music] minus 20. let 's see how that works oh yeah so she 's gotten smaller so now she floats around she looks more like she 's having an adventure now i reckon [Music] we want her to go to a random spot and we also want her to bounce if she gets to the edge because we don 't want her to float off the screen that would be kind of annoying so let 's go into motion and glide so let 's bring that over and we probably wanted to glide for a random amount of time because that means that she 'll go faster or slower so let 's go to operators and we can choose this pick random thing [Music] so we can make it one second which is really fast or 10 seconds which means she 'll just leisurely float around and then we 'll go back to motion and find that bounce bit of code so if on edge bounce and we probably want her to keep doing this over and over again let 's give it a go though okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put in the forever bit of code so we 're going to wrap this around the blue motion bits of code so that this part where she 's gliding around to a random position and bouncing on the edge happens again and again and again let 's just click the green flag to see what it looks like back to the start she 's floating around she 's floating very slowly this must be like the 10 second one yeah oh and she 's floating to another random position so it looks like the forever code is you is working yeah there she goes yeah that 's looking good now we want to send her to some different places because she 's just floating in space which is not you know it 's not terrible but it 's not as interesting as it could be so we 're going to use these colored balls as buttons and those are just default sprites that you find over in this sprite menu here so the code we 're going to use is when the sprite is clicked [Music] we 're going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bunch of backgrounds we 've got five of these little buttons so we want to choose five wacky backgrounds so where could we send her where could harper go up i could go to a canyon [Music] yeah that 's pretty crazy a oh she could end up really tiny floating amongst some flowers yep that 's a pretty good one [Music] a park bench yeah and we could oh let 's send it to the jungle [Music] let 's maybe choose one or two more just so we 've got some options and let 's choose this weird computery thing all right so now we 've got things to choose so now we can switch the backdrop so we go to looks and we want switch backdrop to which one did we want to do let 's go to canyon and then it 's always fun to add a sound let 's click on sounds and how about this boiling let 's see what this point yep that 's pretty good let 's add that sound start sound pop bit boing let 's just click on that [Music] @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then we click stop hey she 's stuck in the canyon you know what we should do yep we should add a bit of code so that when we press the green flag it always goes back to that star background that we had so we want when the green flag clicked switch backdrop to [Music] neon tunnel i think it was stars let 's just make sure it does yeah there we go so she 's floating around we 've changed it the canyon now we just need to add the other buttons so let 's click on the blue one now which is the actually let 's click on the pink one i don 't know why the pink one isn 't next on our list down here so we want to bring in the code when this sprite clicked we want to switch the sorry switch the background to let 's go with flowers and we need a sound for that too let 's try that yep let 's just use that go into sound and start sound pew let 's click on the green flag [Music] @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking really good now what should we do i know let 's have a bit of a shortcut remember we did that trick before where we dragged some code we 're pretty much doing the same code for all of these buttons so we could take a shortcut and drag this over to the blue ball which is over there and then we 'll click on it and see if the code brought over yep so now we can just change these so we can change from flowers to city with water and we can change the sound let 's go into sounds and we 'll pick something from the sound menu go to effects because we just want something really quick [Music] that 's too long yep let 's go with that one [Music] so we 're going to go to the city with water and after sound bonk i think it was bonk yep it was block and we can then copy this code to the green one so we 'll drag it over to the green ball at the bottom there and then we 'll click on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mustn 't have done it properly let 's try that again and it goes let 's see if that worked no oh well let 's just do it from scratch and give us a bit of practice because it 's right down the bottom of the desktop it 's having some problems on my trusty old laptop but that 's all right so we want when sprite clicked go to looks and we want to change the backdrop to what should we choose this time let 's choose forest and now let 's pick a sound go into sounds squeaky toys let 's see what that 's like yep that 's short and it 's kind of crazy so we want to start sound squeaky toy and we need one last one so let 's click on this purple one we 'll go into events when the sprite clicked we wanted to switch the backdrop and this one will switch to jurassic i can 't remember what that one was that 's all right and let 's pick a sound do we have a sound in here already whiz [Music] @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whiz let 's press the green flag [Music] nice let 's try all our buttons [Music] cool that all works but when the button sounds aren 't playing it 's a little bit kind of quiet so maybe we should add some sort of sound playing underneath it we could add some music or we could add just some sort of sound of something happening in the background so let 's go to events when the green flag is clicked we want it to play some sort of music let 's go into sounds and choose the sound [Music] and the best place to choose music and things like that in here is from loops so let 's let 's choose some stuff what do you reckon would be good [Music] no not too classical what about dead space yeah maybe what about drum settler i could try that and if that loops i think that would be fun let 's go back into code and sound and let 's play drum satellite until done because we wanted to play the whole thing and then we want it to just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loop let 's see how it goes [Music] oh yeah so that kind of works so that is how this project is created if you want to start from the very very beginning as i said we also have the project teleport which is in maribyrnong home coders and i might even just put this one up as well just so that you can play with the project that we created today for this video so i hope you had lots of fun today and thanks for joining us again for another marathon home coders my name 's andrew from maribyrnong libraries bye for now"

    "text": "[Music] oh hey i 'm bruce you just caught me working from home you know what i missed the most in this crazy time building robots let 's build something [Music] so first we need a robot that easy now i 'll show you how i built it so the kit we 're using for making our robots is called the lego mindstorms education kit it 's filled with all kinds of robot parts wheels computer things everything you need to build some awesome robots so check it out online at the lego mindstorms website for more inspiration and education [Music] so so so let 's have a look at building this robot dog this is just our screen we use for the coding the play button is always there to load it up um okay let 's have a look we 'll put this loop module in there we can build our program inside that and that just ensures it goes back to the beginning once the program is finished wire them together so they can speak to each other now we can start putting it together first is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so we 'll put the color sensor in there now we 'll have to choose yellow and this port is for number four so it can communicate to the motor speaking of which that 's the next thing to put in is the motor to control the head going up and down then our next thing to do is make the dog stand or in this case jump up so we 'll use both motors this um controls both motors at the same time now we 're going to get him to lift his leg and that 'll just be oh wait for a second and then use one leg to go up okay now this is a fun part we have to use the sound control so we can record our own sounds or use sounds from a library now the next part we have to jiggle the leg so let 's have a look and see how that works and yep so we 're just going to put in four movements of that one leg and we 'll change that in a minute um to make the motion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down again really simple just a little bit of time when one motor goes back down wait for another second and then we want both legs to go down into the seated position and the final piece of code is to take the head back to the beginning position all the way down and that 's it that 's the program so now we 're going to have to go back through the little bits of the program and fine-tune them so that the dog does what we want it to do it 's a pretty fine line between it standing up and falling down but i had to play with it for a fair while and the numbers that i 've done here seem to work for me but they might not necessarily work for you it 's just all about experimentation so we 've already done the color sensor but i 'm just looking at the motor that controls the head going up and down now you can set rotations or degrees for that one i 've set rotations but for the the two motors operating the legs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's easier to understand for me maybe not for you but whatever works so this one we 've gone minus 55 so that makes the legs go up now these little times between the different parts of the program are handy so we 've set it for two seconds there and then we 'll make that one leg go up so by choosing one motor you 're choosing one leg i 've set degrees for it to go up and how many degrees i think probably about minus 100 that will make it go up and then we 'll set the timer again just for a couple of seconds before we make the noise now making the noise we 're going to make our own sound so we 'll go here record sound and we can record our own sound what should we call it and let 's have a look [Music] running water running water that would probably be better and then you can record your own sound so here i am recording the sound you can record it for as long as you like eight seconds is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that will work within the program we can move over to the next one which is shaking the leg now shaking the leg i 've done it fairly simply i 've just got the same motor uh four times in a row but i 'm just going to make it same power on each one so i 've set it to 20. that just makes it either go faster or slower in this case and then i 'm just going to make the leg go up and down so i 'll go probably rotations or no i 'll go degrees again on this one because that makes it easier for me so we 'll go five degrees up and then five degrees down and five degrees up again and five degrees down and that just makes that little shaking motion it 's a little bit of work and you can tweak it but it works out pretty effectively and okay so now we 've got the shaking of the leg we 'll pause it just for a second and that 's what that timer does when you set a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drop down so single motor leg goes down so then we 'll pause it again and set the program for him to sit down so both motors set this reverse of what it was when it started and then the final bit is the head goes down again to its starting position now it 's important to set the starting position so when your program starts again everything is as it was otherwise the head positions and things would all be messed up so now you can see how the program kind of relates to the movement of the dog we 'll just talk through it again so the yellow on that bone that we made controls the program it starts by head going up legs go up single leg goes up and the sound happens and shakes the leg any time now leg goes down both legs go down and head goes down as well reset and ready to go again well okay i guess that 's it i hope you enjoyed watching it as much as i enjoyed making it um if you have any suggestions about things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these kits please let us know you could get the dog to do other things you could build other robots the worlds are always stuck just about anything 's possible well not anything but just about anything alright thanks for watching and we 'll see you next time [Music] bye"

    "text": "[Music] hello i 'm professor christy from maribyrnong libraries and today we 're going to make our very own air freshener and learn about a very special molecule called a polymer so what you 'll need for this experiment is a glass jar some gelatin some salt got some salt flakes in there some food coloring and some sort of smelling oil so i 've got lavender here but you might like to use eucalypt oil or tea tree oil whatever smell you like i thought i 'd use lavender to bring the smell of spring into my house you 'll also need some hot water so you might need to get a grown up to help you because you don 't want to burn yourself so first of all what we 'll do is grab our hot water and it is very hot so i 've got to be very careful and i 'm going to slowly pour that into my jar we can see the steam coming off oh that is hot and leave it there next i 'm going to add one teaspoon of gelatin and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dissolve the gelatin so i 'm going to give that a stir until i can see it 's dissolved [Music] i don 't want to stir too fast because you might splash it out of the side it 's a good idea to put something down underneath in case you make a little bit of a mess like i will okay so that one 's looking nice and dissolved so what we 'll do next is add a little bit of food coloring i might choose a tiny bit of red for my mom to make it nice and vibrant and you don 't have to add food coloring coloring you might like to add some glitter to make it sparkle you might like to go out into your garden pick some lovely flowers and put them into it whatever you like so now we 've given that one a little bit of a stir that 's all in there so next i 'm going to add a few drops of my oil this is lavender it smells beautiful already let 's put a few little drops in and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing i 'm going to add in is one teaspoon of salt so i 'll just measure that out and in that goes and the reason we add salt is because salt acts as a preservative so that makes sure that we don 't grow any bacteria on our refresher because that would not be good at all now as you can see that 's still a liquid so what we need to do is put it into the fridge overnight so that it sets and forms the gel just like you would do if you 're making a nice jelly so i 'm going to put this one over here to pop in the fridge in a moment and i 've got this one here and as you can see it 's a gel i popped a few lavender leaves in yesterday that 's what those little things are and now i can put this anywhere in my house and i 'll have the beautiful smell of lavender coming out now the reason that this happens is the gelatin contains long chain like molecules called polymers and now when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down again that 's why we have to pop it into the fridge they form lots of little cross links with each other which creates a 3d sort of scaffold and that holds the water in shape and creates the gel and because we 've put the essential oils in they 're now trapped in there and it will take a while for them to evaporate and to come out so that 's why this will last for a while with the beautiful smell of lavender coming out so that 's that 's all you 'll need to make your own room freshen up and like i said you can add any smell that you like and any sort of decorations make sure you dissolve it all and the most important thing to do is put it into the fridge so that it will set and then you 'll be able to have your very own room freshener well that 's all there is for today so i hope you go and make lovely room freshness and i can 't wait to hear all about them i 'll see you next time bye"

    "text": "[Music] foreign [Music] welcome to maribyrnong home coders for maribyrnong libraries my name 's andrew today we 're going to do some random fun so random fun in space to be more exact so this project is called space junk and we 've basically got lots of stuff floating around that you can click on spaceship that flies through at random times so this is pretty crazy and i reckon anyone who creates remixes of this will be able to do some even crazier stuff so [Music] let 's have a look at a template that we have on our studio which is maribyrnong home coders so we have this template space frog and stereo and the reason we have this template is because the stereo and the frog are not standard scratch elements that you can bring in as sprites so the things that are different about them well the frog has got the spacesuit that 's pretty different but also the stereo [Music] has the speakers that grow larger and smaller which is kind of cool and it goes along with the music that we had playing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we start with the stereo so make sure you 've got the stereo selected and we want to begin with an event so when the green flag is clicked [Music] we want the stereo to switch costumes so that it 's showing the big speakers and the small speakers and the big speakers and the small speakers we always want the costume to start off on radio a because you want the stereo to look like it 's off so we brought over a switch block of code switch costume to radio a and then we kind of want it to float around we want everything to float around in this project it 's all about floaty space craziness so we 're going to go over to motion we haven 't used motion in any of the projects that we 've had on mara home coders just yet this is the first time so we 're going to use a bit of code that is called glide so bring this over and this standard bit of code just wants to glide for one seconds to to a random position but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a random position because we 're all about random stuff so let 's click on operators and we have a pick random button so let 's pick this clip this over into that little bit of space i reckon picking random 1 to 10 seconds should be pretty good so that will change the speed at which our stereo is flying around so it 'll either go slow or fast depending on how many seconds it takes to glide now we also kind of don 't want it to go off the edge of the screen because that would be annoying so we want it to bounce if it reaches an edge and there 's a handy bit of code for that as well so if we go back up to motion there is a bit of code that is called if on edge bounce so let 's drag that over we want this to happen forever so we 're going to go over to control and use the forever bit of code i 'm going to wrap it around the switch costume through to the if on edge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happening again and again and again and again forever so let 's click the green flag see what happens oh yeah so it 's floating around and it 's randomly chosen to float around pretty slowly let 's see if we can get to an edge it 's gonna bounce [Music] yeah kind of flipped around there that 's kind of cool now let 's add some other things so how about we add some sound that would be a good idea so oh yeah i 've already got some sound selected here but maybe we could choose another one so i had chosen dance energetic pretty good [Music] but we might want to choose some other sound so we went to the sounds tab and we 're going to click on choose the sound let 's try loops because there 's lots of interesting things in loops let 's try a few sounds [Music] classical piano it 's a bit weird we could go with it though let 's try that so then we 'll go back to code and then let 's choose an event so what we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so when the stereo is clicked we want it to play that music so i drag dragged over the when sprite is clicked block there and then let 's get our sound play sound classical piano until done let 's see if it works let 's click the green flag [Music] great let 's just stop that and we haven 't got any of the sort of speaker bouncing happening yet so let 's grab another when this sprite is clicked and this time we want it to change costumes so we use this code which is next costume but we wanted to do that again and again and again and i reckon we want it to change you know maybe three or four times every second because we want it to look like it 's really banging so let 's go to control and find the weight one seconds [Music] and change it to weight point two five seconds which is a quarter of a second which means that it 's going to happen four times every second and then we want this to repeat a bit because we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try a repeat [Music] 10. we 'll see how long this goes for because we probably want to go want it to go for as long as the song let 's try the green arrow um green flag sorry and we 'll click [Music] doesn 't really go long enough does it let 's oh try let 's try 15 seconds okay [Music] now that was more like 20 seconds so let 's change it to 20 seconds [Music] stop and start yep that 's pretty good close enough anyway so now we have a stereo floating in space playing classical music wow that 's just like an old movie yeah what about this frog [Music] what should we make this frog do i reckon we should make this frog float and croak so we 're gonna start with the when the flag clicked around and we want the frog to play a sound i reckon we probably want sound croak [Music] is already loaded into this file and there was also another sound that i want to play which is big boy [Music] oh yeah that 's pretty good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 've just started so we in fact want a when this sprite is clicked a bit of code let 's start it again so now if we click that sprite yep that 's a satisfying croak and buoying now we want to move our frog around because that would be much much more interesting than a frog just sitting there in space doing nothing so let 's maybe rotate the frog a little bit because a frog would be sort of waving its little feet around in space and going in weird directions so let 's use a bit of code that is called set rotation style let 's bring that over and then we want to glide just like with the stereo so let 's go to let 's bring in this glide to random position and we 're going to use the same operator we did before which was the pick random one to 10 which is in operators yep so that 's looking good and we also want it to bounce if it gets to the edge because we don 't want the frog floating off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the stereo let 's go over to control and grab that forever bit of code and wrap it around all of this code that we 've created so now if we press stop and then we click the green arrow again our frog is bouncing around in space pretty good [Music] oh yeah very nice now i 'm going to change this set rotation style to all around and we 'll see what happens is much gonna happen [Music] see what happens if when he bounces not a lot you can play around with that though [Music] i don 't think that 's a perfect bit of code but we do have a floating frog so there we go now let 's bring in some other stuff so how about some cheesy puffs cheesy puffs anyone yeah let 's do that [Music] cheesy puffs in space and what do we want these cheesy puffs to do well let 's have a look let 's start off with a when the green flag is clicked the ball moves around so we 're going to go into motion and this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the glide to random position then we 're going to go into operators and grab the pick random one to ten put that in there and then going back into motion and grab our bounce if on edge there we go if one edge bounce and you might remember we also went into control and grabbed the forever wrap around so now we have our cheesy puffs in space wow how would you eat them that frog is not going to be able to eat cheesy puffs in space because of the helmet it 's so cruel let 's press stop and now we need some sounds how about we go to the sound and click on the sound tab what sounds would be good let 's choose one maybe we 'll go to effects let 's choose do a cheesy puff salute maybe yeah maybe too much maybe a fight yep that could be good and do we want to maybe have another sound [Music] i would sort of go crazy with the bite [Music] well well that 's pretty weird let 's choose doorbell all right if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until done and we 'll grab another one because we want two sounds and we 'll make this so that when the sprite is clicked so when the cheesy puffs are clicked these sounds play so kind of put those together so maybe the crunch first let 's give this a go let 's click the green flag [Music] yeah that 's pretty weird that is definitely bringing the random to this project [Music] i think that officially sounds crazy what else could we bring [Music] in oh yeah a donut everybody loves donuts here we go let 's choose from food donut yep donuts are awesome so we 're gonna pretty much grab the same code that we 've been using for all the other objects which is when the green flag is clicked go to motion we 're gliding hide to random position and we 're going to use our operator where it 's picking a random number from 1 to 10 to decide how fast it 's going to move along and then we also want to go back to motion and make sure that we make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want it to do this forever [Music] yep let 's see if this is working [Music] yeah so that 's a floating donut in space unidentified food object so that 's there yeah we probably want it to play a sound so let 's press stop and go to events when the sprite is clicked [Music] we want to play let 's go to sounds and we 'll select something down the bottom with choose a sound what is a good sound for eating a donut is it a guitar donut alert maybe what about no [Music] i feel like that when you 're eating a doughnut bubbles no it 's a bit quiet all the other sounds if they 're playing are gonna drown that out yeah car horn let 's try that so we 'll go back to code and we wanted to play the sound car horn until done whenever we click the donut let 's click start and let 's go that is crazy now have you noticed something about this project they 're just flashing in nothing so let 's bring in a backdrop let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screen and choose a backdrop and it just happens to be a handy space button just here um should we choose kind of normal stars or maybe let 's choose that galaxy there yeah that looks pretty good now one other thing we could add is an object that appears and moves through the project at random i think that would be really good so how about we choose a spaceship from our sprites there 's a nice default spaceship that is available in scratch let 's see it might be in fantasy depends how you classify fantasy [Music] let 's try spaceship oh there we go rocket ship gotta know what they 're called if you 're looking for them so how do we do this well this one 's not as complicated as you might think i 'm to begin by changing the direction that the rocket is facing and i 'm going to do this in the costumes you could do it with code but this will also give us a chance to use the costumes area so i 'm going to select the whole thing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a keyboard you can hold down the shift key and it will make sure that it kind of clicks into a perfect right angle let 's click on the next frame and have a bit more practice so i 'm clicking and dragging and now i have everything selected and scroll down now i am going to turn it that way holding down the shift key and once again we 've got our whole rocket ship selected grab that little arrow thing here and turn holding the shift key perfect [Music] fourth frame click and drag grab shift key and turn and the last frame here we go those arrows shift and turn it so now we have our rocket ship facing the right way because i want it to go from left to right that 's just the kind of thing that i like in rocket ship movement [Music] now we 're going to begin with [Music] making it animate through its frames because we 've got some really nice animated frames that are just there ready to go we 're going to begin with a when green flag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tiny tiny amount of time i always like to put in wait 0.1 seconds so i 'm going to click in here [Music] and then we want our next costume and go back to control and bring over this wait one second but change it to 0.1 and we 've got four frames so we want to want to do this four times after the first one so [Music] i 'm going to [Music] duplicate some stuff the easiest way to do that is grab the two bits of code you want and right click and duplicate and then i can [Music] do the same thing again whoops i just missed a bit of code there and again [Music] so we 've got one two three four five that should cover it and we want it to keep going forever so i 'm gonna use that forever wrap around code again okay let 's click the flag there we go our spaceship is flying and looking awesome all right so if we want it to appear at random it 's got to stay hidden at the start so let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then we 're going to go into looks and select hide [Music] that means when we click the green flag that spaceship is going to look like it 's not there now i 'm also going to just move it over move it to the edge of the screen as much as i can because i want it to start here and this is the easiest way of setting the next bit of code that we 're going to do so we want it to go to a certain position so we want it to go to x and y so x is the horizontal and y is vertical so it 's giving us a location on the screen that we want the spaceship to be in [Music] now i 'm going to get rid of that bit of hide code just for now so that we can check that it 's definitely going to go to the right position okay so we click the green arrow and it 's gone to 303 x and minus 17 y which is this spot here it 's exactly where we want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to add that bit of hide code back in a little bit now we wanted to just pick a random time to appear so we 'll go back into operators and [Music] let 's see we need this bit of green but we want it to wait so if we click on control we 've got this weight one seconds let 's bring that over and we 'll pop the pick random into this weight make it wait between one and one let 's stick with one and ten seconds [Music] and then we want the rocket to appear so let 's click and grab a show [Music] and then we want it to glide over to this side of the screen over to the right side of the screen but this stereo is sitting right now so let 's grab motion and we want it to glide to a certain spot and how fast do we want it to go let 's we don 't want it to be one second because we won 't see it let 's try three seconds and we want it to glide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over to where i want it to go [Music] now we 're going to have to tell this bit of glidecode where we want it luckily we can see where we want it down here in the sprite information just above where you can see all the little sprites here we have an x position and a y position so we can just copy those so we want our rocket to go to 282 and minus [Music] that 's where we want it to end up and then we want to hide it so let 's go back to looks and find our hide code [Music] and we might replace the hide code that we took away earlier [Music] all right now let 's see and we might change the random waiting just so we don 't have to wait forever let 's make it one to three seconds and see what it does so let 's click the green flag oh yeah there 's our spaceship [Music] that 's good that 's going to do that every one to three seconds if we tell it that he needs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we do that we need that forever control which comes in so handy so let 's just put it after that first hide because we don 't want it to we 're already hiding it at the end anyway [Music] let 's click this again so is it going to appear yeah now it should appear again yeah there we go so now it 's picking between one and three seconds to randomly appear so let 's change that back to the 10 that we originally had now that we 've tested to see if the rocket ship works a couple of interesting things we could do is we could make the rocket ship play a sound when you click it so it could be almost like a little mini game so if you manage to click the rocket when it 's zooming past it plays the sound so to do that we use out when this sprite clicked bit of code [Music] and then we need a sound so what about go to the sounds tab and select something so the sound would oh let 's let 's go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pretty crazy sound what about squeaky toy yeah squeaky toy so now when you click it it 'll make a squeaky toy noise so we 're going to drag this over and click go now let 's see how good my reflexes are [Music] oh yeah i think the rocket should make a noise when it 's going as well how about we choose another sound to drop into the code here too so once it 's shown and it 's gliding [Music] let 's try something really rockety sounding so we want to use start sound because if we have play until done it 's not going to do anything until that sound is over so we want our sound to go at the same time as the rocket flying not before it appears and i think there was a good sound in here space ripple let 's go into sounds and see what this sounds like yeah yeah maybe we can do better how about let 's try and choose a sound [Music] space wow that 's kind of cool it 's a little bit glorified yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's pretty good space flyby yeah that 's the one we want let 's click on that all right so let 's bring in space flyby so we 've already got our bit of code in let 's change it from space ripple which sounds like a delicious ice cream to space flyby all right let 's click the green flag [Music] yep that 's cool [Music] [Music] i like that so you could bring in all sorts of other objects and add those to your project and make it way crazier than this but this space frog template is available for you to use so you can go to marabanon home coders find the space frog and stereo template and bring in any code you like or there 's another option our other project which is space junk so that 's one i did earlier which has even more objects in it so if i click the green flag for that frog rocket so if you want to go and remix the project or do something from the beginning feel free to do so um everything 's on our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's been really fun so thanks everyone who 's been watching the videos and joining in my name 's andrew for maribyrnong libraries"

    "text": "[Music] foreign [Music] hi my name 's andrew thanks for joining us for maribyrnong home coders for ameriban on libraries today we 're going to do something a little bit different we 're going to do some arty stuff and just a little bit of coding so now we 're going to start is we 're going to find a project that 's on our maribyrnong home coders scratch studio group and this project is called loopy frame by frame animation so i 'm just going to click on it and show you what it is so this is a really simple project that has a tiny bit of code that lets you check your animations as you make them so i 'm just going to click the little green flag yeah so it 's a little frog and he 's got his tongue wiggling and he 's winking which is pretty simple we 've got this code here which is really really easy and we 're going to create something from the start i 'll step you through it but before that i 'm going to show you what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different frames [Music] each time there 's a little bit more movement and it means that when you play them really fast you get the frog blinking winking and flicking his tongue just like that [Music] all right so we 're going to start from the very beginning now go to file and new there 's our project [Music] now we 're not going to use the the little cat today so today we 're going to choose the same frog that i found earlier so let 's click on animals and we have our frog so we brought our frog in now if we go over here to the costumes you can see there 's nothing much going on here it 's just the frog now i 'm going to show you how to do this code and i 'll explain what it means so we want to go to events and we want this code to start when we click the green flag so i 'll bring over this green flag when clicked bit of code here and we want it to change costumes every time and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tiny tiny amount of time so we want to use weight which is over in the control area and i like to use wait 0.1 seconds because it means everything goes really fast but you can change that to whatever speed you like you can play around with the number that 's in there the other thing that we wanted to do is just keep going forever and forever and forever forever until the stop button is pressed so that 's our code it 's easy so you can add that to any creation you want and then all you 've got to do is create different frames of the animation so this is really fun and if you 're good at drawing on a tablet or a computer you can create animations that you can play over and over and over again you can add the little animated characters to your other creations so you might have a game where you 've got a sprite that is running along and you can have the running legs you can have all sorts of things so it 's really really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our frog so you right click if you 're using a mouse or a computer [Music] and click duplicate and we 've got an exact copy of this frog so we 're going to change the frog a little bit so we might make the frog 's eyes move around a little bit you 'll notice that the pupil and the big part of the eye are all connected and if we want to be able to move just the pupil we 're going to have to use this button up here which is called ungroup so click on that click away and then click on the pupil so we 've got the eye separated let 's do the same to the other eye so we click on it click on ungroup up here at the top click away and then select the eye [Music] now it 's probably easier if you 're moving the eyes to select both of the eyes so if you 've got a keyboard you can click the shift button and click the left mouse button and now you 've got both of the eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we might move them to the middle so the frog is looking at us and i reckon we might do something with the tongue too [Music] so for this i 'm going to change the tool that i 'm using so there is a reshape tool at the moment i 'm using the select tool so let 's look at that so you 've got lots of little what 's called anchor points so you can move these around and change the shape of the frog 's tongue [Music] there we go [Music] it should but anyway this is kind of just giving you a rough idea of how to do this because you don 't want to spend two hours watching me create something that looks really really awesome but takes forever okay so if we click back on the first frame and then on this one our frog is starting to move [Music] pretty good and we might duplicate this frame again and just make a few more changes so i 'm going to click on both of the eyeballs using the shift key and move them move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tongue [Music] i 'm going to make it go really big and wobbly [Music] well that is an enormous tongued frog and then if i click back on the frames i 've got that happening how about we see what it looks like when it just just loops forever now the frog 's looking pretty small on the screen so i 'm going to change this frog to look much bigger so i 'm going to use 300 oh yeah and i 'm going to drag him over here let 's click the green flag there we go that 's what our animation looks like amazing i 'm actually i 'm sure you can do much much better if you spend more time drawing your frames so that kind of works and if you wanted some sound added to that you could go to sound and then the sounds tab [Music] and then you could choose a sound so we might want some sort of croak so i 'm going to click on animals and do we have any frogs or croaks oh here we go [Music] yep that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ code and we 'll [Music] and the start sound crook maybe just here this is going to sound a bit weird i think let 's see how we go whoa that 's cool but weird so what we could do is we could add the sound croak to its own little bit of code so that it 's not repeating every 0.1 seconds [Music] so how about we create another event and we 'll start off with when flag clicked just take this start sound crook out of there go so we 'll go back to sound i reckon we 'll probably just eat this forever so play sound croak until done and then we 'll go back to control and we 'll get that same bit of code that we used for the frames to play our sound again and again let 's see if that works so you can see sometimes it 's a good idea to have separate things for separate actions because if we combine the the sound with the frames it was sounding pretty weird so if something 's not working as a big chunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's our frog with sound and with different frames happening so if you just want to mess around with the frog that i 'd already created in another project then you can also do that in our merobinong home coders studio so let 's go back to the studio [Music] there we go there we go home coders down here is loopy frame by frame animation [Music] and this is the one that i 've seen way more time on so we 've got all of our costumes so you can see each frame i 've changed it just a little bit and the eye movements are a little bit slower the tongue i 've just flipped upside down each time i think i 'll just show you how that 's done so if i click on the tongue what i did was i flipped it vertical just like that make sure that i 've got it the right way around and then if we play it the tongue is going crazy there and we 've got a nice wink [Music] if you 're really good at drawing you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complex [Music] it 's really really fun and maybe i 'll go over some of the different areas here in the costumes part of scratch so we had our select tool which kind of selects big objects that are all kind of joined together we also have the reshape tool which lets you drag around and move the anchor points we have paintbrush so with paintbrush you can choose a color if you want to use a color that you 've already got on the screen the easiest way is to use the eyedropper tool so by clicking on there and if we wanted to use green we could just click here and our fill color will change to green then we can choose how big we want our brush to be so at the moment it 's on 10 which is this size if i change it to 36 it 's going to be bigger that 's going to be really hard to draw with but if i shrink it down to say three you can get a nice line there [Music] this would be really good for drawing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mouse which is what i 'm doing today we also have the eraser tool so if you want to get rid of chunks of your character or if you make a mistake that 's a good way to fix it up and if you make a mistake like erasing some of your character that you didn 't mean to do you can undo it with the undo arrow here and then if you think well maybe it looked better with a bit of it missing you can click the redo arrow click undo there there 's also a paint bucket so we could change the color of the frog to let 's change the frog to blue or bluey green let 's make it blue so you could make a blue frog you could make the frog change colors throughout the animation and you 'll also notice you can keep this running while you work and see what the changes are like as you go let 's undo the blue color you can also type in some text [Music] and you can change the different fonts too there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ [Music] yeah a few different ones [Music] not too bad pretty good options i 'm just gonna undo that because we don 't want the text in there you 've also got line tools these are good for doing straight lines so you click and drag to do those so if you 're doing something like a vehicle or a house or something like that it could be really good to draw it with this tool just undo that we also have shapes so we have circles and squares with these you have an outline color and a fill color if you decide you don 't want to have an outline you can change it to no outline just draw an example there you can change the colors [Music] select tool to delete that one and the square is pretty much the same as the circle but just a different shape so that 's pretty cool and you can zoom in and zoom out as well with these magnifying glasses you might already be familiar with a lot of this stuff because it 's a lot it 's like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called vector graphics so it doesn 't break up into little pixel squares like it does in something like paint or paint 3d or things like that so now you 've got everything you need to create some pretty amazing little animations you can do heaps and heaps of different things with animated frames and sound and code that makes things move around the screen could make some super super awesome stuff so i hope today 's video has been really helpful [Music] and i 'm really looking forward to seeing any creations that people might want to put on our scratch studio which is marabong home coders [Music] thanks for joining us today for maribyrnong libraries my name 's andrew bye"

    "text": "g 'day i 'm zoologist chris humphrey and welcome to the city of maribyrnong 's biodiversity workshops people often ask me what is biodiversity and why do we need to protect it well that 's a great question in healthy ecosystems every organism has a job to do an ecological niche just like the jobs people do in our communities every animal and plant is vital for a healthy productive environment we need to protect all species just not our favorites the city of maribyrnong is home to a myriad of amazing wildlife and plants however many of them are facing tough times development and urbanisation has rapidly eaten away natural habitat for many animal species pollution introduced predators and pests have also played a role in driving many types of wildlife to a threatened status and even local extinction planet earth is in the midst of a climate and biodiversity emergency australia has the worst mammal extinction rate of any country in the world we all need to act now by protecting our local environments before it 's too late if we can 't save nature and if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's humankind finished it 's absolutely amazing the abundance of native animal species which still lives in the city of maribyrnong it 's so important to protect all native species because remember they were here first let 's meet some of our local wildlife denizens and discover how they help people out that 's right they actually make our lives better meet one of my favorite reptiles the blotched blue tongue lizard these prehistoric looking creatures are harmless to people and love eating snails and slugs in our gardens but they also eat fungi and wildflowers and when they eat wildflowers they poop out the seed and they spread native flowers across our landscape what a great job blotch blue tongue lizards can often be seen sun baking on bike tracks footpaths and even roads so slow down and keep your eyes peeled for some sun baking lizards so just invite a blues and lizard to move on into your back garden and you won 't have any pest animals eating up all your veggies in your veggie patch say hi to the short beaked echidna it 's incredible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of maravanol so close to the metropolis of melbourne these monitorings are living relics and the closest living relative to the platypus echidnas have thousands of receptors on the tip of their snout for picking up the electrical impulses of the prey that they 're hunting echidnas need natural habitat corridors to forage for their food echidnas are sometimes seen along the maribyrnong river keep your dog on the lead at all times when walking because dogs can easily kill our unique and precious animals who would have thought that this solitary macropod the swamp wallaby still lives along the environmental corridor of the marabong river the shoretel sign that you have swamp wallabies living in your neck of the woods is look out for their droppings reclusive in nature be sure to look out for them feeding on grass and foliage in the early morning and late afternoon love them or loathe them snakes are important for our environment they help us out by eating up all of the mice and the rats although most snakes in mirabenong are dangerously venomous if you leave them alone they 'll leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the summer months it 's also another good reason to walk your dog on a lead dogs if bitten by a snake can die meet the gray-headed flying fox i think they look like a flying chihuahua aren 't they wonderful this is australia 's largest bat it 's called a mega bat greyhood of flying fox are much maligned animals in people 's backyards you know why they gobble up our rightening fruit a threatened species nationally only 10 of their former population remains loss of habitat and persecution from humans is the main cause of their demise these beautiful mega bats are refugees trying to eke out a living they 're such important pollinators of native plants and tree species fruit bats don 't need fancy shampoos to get rid of head lice and ectoparasites they simply hang upside down and urinate on themselves the uric acid in their wii burns off these pesky pests hey don 't try that yourselves so why not go outside tonight look up into the maribyrnong night sky and see if you can see a grey-headed flying fox don 't we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we protect biodiversity together the health of our planet depends on all of us we all need to change our habits behavior and impacts on our natural world think locally and join me in making a positive difference in the city of maribyrnong let 's act by planting native habitat in our own backyards schoolyard or workplace planting trees is also a great way to help cool our planet and help reduce harmful greenhouse gases a little hollow like this a little nesting box gives a possum a place to seek shelter in and to raise a family be responsible pet owners walk your dogs on a leash don 't let them chase and kill our wildlife keep your cat enclosed it 's safer for your cat and they won 't eat our wildlife avoid reduce reuse recycle it 's absolutely critical that we all work together in the protection of biodiversity because the health of our planet depends on all of us [Music] love where you live in the city of [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] maribyno [Music] [Applause] [Music]

    "text": "[Music] foreign [Music] hi my name 's andrew thanks for joining marabong home coders for maribyrnong libraries today we 're going to do another knock-knock joke but this time we 're going to do one where you can interact with the knock-knock joke a little bit more than usual so we 're going to start by deleting the little cat and for this knock knock joke we 're going to choose another fantasy background so i reckon inside a castle so we 're using the backdrops menu to get that just like that and now we want some characters so we 'll click on the choose the sprite menu down here and for this we 're going to use fantasy characters so we want the elf and back down to choose sprites and has your characters and we want the fairy as well so we 're just going to arrange the fairy and the elf on our screen i think the fairy might want to be a bit bigger let 's make 150 so one and a half times which usually is and let 's click on the elf and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times the normal size and we kind of want them to face each other so i 'm going to turn the elf around so i 'm going to click on the elf and click on the costumes tab and now i can do flip horizontal just here to turn him around we 'll go back to the code and we can start coding so we want to start a little animation when the green flag here is clicked so we need to go to events drag over out when green flag clicks and what 's the first thing we 're going to have yep we 're going to have a knock knock so we 'll click on looks and we 're going to bring over say something in this case hello for two seconds we 're going to make it knock knock [Music] and on some of our previous [Music] exercises we have also added a sound so we 're going to do that as we go this time rather than going back and doing it at the end so we can go to the sounds tab just here and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was called tap conga so we 're gonna [Music] do that sound i 'll just play it so that you know how it sounds sounds a little bit like when you get an instant message or messenger or something like that so we 're going to click start sound tap conga let 's just see what happens when we click the green flag knock knock and it goes for two seconds perfect now we 're going to do the same thing that we had in our last knock knock exercise which is we 're going to broadcast some messages so broadcasting messages is down here in the control area [Music] actually no it 's not it is in events i find those colors very very similar all right so we 're going to broadcast message one and then we 're going to have the fairy receive message one and respond so let 's program a fairy so click on the fairy down here and when the fairy receives message one we wanted to do something so we probably want her to say who 's there yeah that would make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on sending and we want to [Music] ask this time because this is where we 're going to be able to type in a word so we 're going to ask who 's there [Music] who 's there all right and wait now we might also use that tap conga sound on here so we don 't have that sound for our fairy yet so we 're gonna have to get that sound put into the fairy sprite here so it 's a percussion sound it 's right down the bottom tap conga now it 's available for the fairy to use as well so let 's go back into coding and we will plot start sound tap congo as i explained previously the difference between start sound and play sound until done is nothing else can happen if you select play sound until done until the sound is completely finished but if you click if you have start sound the sound will start playing and then other things can happen at the same time now what shall we do next we will do something new which is an answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how these work as we go along so i 'm going to call this who 's there [Music] so now i 'm going to drag this one over and change the my variable to who 's there [Music] and [Music] on sensing i 'm going to grab this little answer thing [Music] and let 's just click it to see what happens knock knock who 's there oh okay so we can type an answer [Music] okay so who 's there is rob so that 's kind of recording what the answer is now after this we probably want to broadcast a message back to the elf so let 's go back to events and we 're going to broadcast [Music] a new message just message two just helps us keep track we 've got them going one two etc all right so now we 're going to go back to the elf what should we have happen next we want the elf to receive message too so let 's go to the looks area and we want the elf to say our answer so we don 't want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can pop in our answer here [Music] and we probably also want our tap conga sound so let 's go to sounds and start sound tap conga and then we want to broadcast another message let 's go back to events and broadcast message three let 's make a new message and everything is just happening there in the background this h3 we might just click on that again just to see what 's happening knock knock who 's there let 's type in [Music] elf and then the elf says elf hooray so that 's working so they 're having a conversation but we 've decided what the answer is now this is where it gets a little bit interesting we 're going to make the fairy sort of put the elf on the right track because if the elf doesn 't say the right thing then the joke 's not really going to work [Music] so we 're going to start a new bit of code for the fairy when i receive a message here so when i receive message three i 'm probably going to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in because we know we always want the top conquer sound when something new happens with a message what we want to happen in the joke is for the elf to say the word tank so that the jerk works so if you type in something that 's not tank we want the fairy to then say hey could you type in tank because then the joke will work if you don 't type in tank the jerk is not going to work so let 's see how we go let 's type in an art or let 's put in an ask so for this um don 't say you 're real [Music] you need to say something funny like tank tank 's not a really funny word is it but i guess in the joke it 's going to be funny so funny is spelt funny there we go it 's got the right number of ends in it now so we 've got don 't say your real name maybe we should make that an exclamation mark so that she 's kind of annoyed just need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next thing we want to add [Music] is we want to set another variable so we 're going to call this variable joke answer [Music] there we go [Music] so we 're going to set jerk answer to be the answer that we typed in so let 's drag this over [Music] and then what happens knock knock who 's there um let 's say steve steve the elf steve don 't say your real name you need to say something funny like tank [Music] at the moment nothing else is going to work because we haven 't put in the code but this is as far as we 've got now we need to make sure that if we type the wrong answer again so if we don 't type tank we need the fairy to keep saying come on type tank tank otherwise this joke is not going to happen [Music] so we 're going to use a [Music] so if the answer equals tank we want it to do something if the answer doesn 't equal tank we want it to do something else so let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here whoops so we want to then pop in the answer so if the answer equals tank what do we want it to do probably ask tank who so let 's do that let 's go to looks and drag over say tanku [Music] you can probably guess where this joke is going [Music] and we might want to tap conquer [Music] and then we would want to prompt [Music] the elf to do something so we might want to send nothing another message so let 's broadcast oh and we want them [Music] i want the fairy to wait as well so let 's create a new message which is message four so we 're broadcasting message four and waiting let 's see and then what if the elf doesn 't say tank what do we want to do probably want to ask again so let 's ask say tank so we want to make it really obvious what they need to do and we probably want to tap in a conga sound so let 's drag tap conga into here and let 's see what [Music] happens there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time sally don 't say a real name you need to say something funny like tank okay i don 't want to say tank i want to say um hot dog [Music] say tank okay that 's good what if i type in something else um [Music] that stops we might need to add a bit more code because we want that theory to keep prompting over and over and over again so for that let 's use over in the control area uh forever and we want the forever to start just after the joke answer so that this whole bit of code the if and else keeps going forever and ever and ever until we get the answer tank so let 's give this a go [Music] let 's press the green flag knock knock who 's there let 's try um [Music] goat [Music] don 't say your real name you need to say something funny like tank i 'm not going to say tank i 'm going to say kettle say tank no i 'm gonna say uh beanbag say tank okay so that 's going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you all right i think we 're ready for the punch line [Music] and we 're getting a tap and a tap and a tap and a tap this is going forever hopefully when we add our next bit of code that will stop so let 's see what do we want the elf to do now [Music] so let 's click over to the elf so we want to receive message for let 's go back to events when i receive message for what do i want to do i want to say the punchline which is you 're welcome [Music] which is pretty hilarious and we want a tap conga [Music] just before that and jokes are good to have a bit of a laugh at the end of so yeah we need to find the sound in here [Music] let 's add a buff so that would be in voice and i 've seen dreams there 's a really good crowd there we go let 's bring that one in go back to our code and play sound crowd laugh until done and then we want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extra sounds going so let 's go to control there 's a stop all here there we go now we also probably won 't don 't want to have this information up here the who 's there and the joke answer so let 's just go into variables and we 'll unclick the little tick boxes there so that we can 't see them now let 's give everything a go knock knock who 's there jill jill the elf don 't say a real name you need to say something funny like tank no we 're going to say [Music] we 're going to say [Music] nope tank let 's type in tank thank you you 're welcome and the big laugh oh that 's hilarious well so we 've done another knock knock joke and this time we 've been able to interact with it and type in our own answers [Music] so that 's all worked out really well so if you want to see how this is done we have this project on our maribyrnong home coders studio which is on the scratch.mit.edu website and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's in here so if you get stuck you 'll be able to see what i 've done and you can also just remix the project so if you wanted to change it to another joke or change the characters or whatever you 'd like to do you 're welcome to do that as well so hopefully you 've learned some interesting stuff today and you can do all sorts of really interesting stuff with your knock knock jokes and your scratch coding so thanks very much for joining me today my name is andrew for maribyrnong home coders at maribyrnong libraries bye [Music]"

    "text": "[Music] hello i 'm professor christie from marathon libraries and i 'm here today to wish you a very happy science week and to do a fun experiment with you all about the effects of air pressure now air pressure is so important in science as he explains weather patterns and a variety of other wonders so what you 'll need for this experiment are some candles just got these little birthday candles you 'll need some water as you can see i 've put some food coloring in this so i 'll be able to see the water and some jars or glasses just anything that 's bigger than your candle now you also need help from an adult because you 'll need someone to light your candle for you so what i 'm going to do first is attach my candle to this plate i 'm using a little bit of blue tack because they don 't stand up by themselves but if you have a bigger candle it might just be able to stand up so that 's there now i 'm going to pour some water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a bit of an edge on it okay so that 's the water now first now i 'm gonna light the candle [Music] okay now that that one 's being lit i 'm going to slowly put this bottle on top of the candle and we 're going to see what happens so first we 're going to see how long the candle stays lit and then we can say it 's still going now so the candle will eventually go out when it runs out of oxygen in this container so as you can see that 's already happened and now the water is starting to rise up in this little glass bottle now what 's happened is the candle flame has heated up the air in the glass the hot air has expanded which has made the candle go out now once that 's happened the air inside the glass cools down and contracts which creates low pressure within this glass and which forms a sucking motion so that this is sucked up into the bottle so let 's have another look i 've got a bigger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's almost like magic like the candle 's drinking up the water now i 'm just going to carefully get rid of this one i 'll just pop that one there and i 've got blue again because this one didn 't stand up either now you need an adult [Music] now what do you think might happen because this candle is a little bit bigger perhaps we 'll try a bigger jar as well and we 'll see if the candle stays lit for longer [Music] pour our water in not too much so now that candle 's going let 's put this jar on top and our candles still lit now this candle seems to be lasting a lot longer why do you think that might be do you think it 's got anything to do with the different sizes of the glasses i 'm using so now it 's starting to slowly go out and so now that 's out we know that all of the oxygen has been deleted from this glass and we can slowly see this one rising up too but as you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was in our original one i 'll put that back so you can see [Music] so do you think that might be because of the sizes of the jars and the candles so what you can do at home is experiment with all different size canvas and jars and make notes of what your results are and share them in the comments below so wishing you all a very happy science week make sure you have a lot of fun doing this experiment and you 'll see everything that you need listed as well so you can get started and i can 't wait to hear about all your experiments bye [Music] you"

    "text": "[Music] welcome to maribyrnong home coders for maribyrnong library service my name 's andrew today we 're going to create a color guessing game right here you can see our scratch studio which is called marabong home coders so right here we have the color guessing game this is the whole project which has all of the code included and we also have a template which is what we 'll be using today so if we click on the template i 'll show you what 's inside it so if you would like to join in on this you can go to this page and there will be a remix button at the top so if you click on that you 'll then see a screen a lot like this now we 're on the codes tab and there 's no code here which is exactly what we want we do have a costume which is why i 've created the template just to save you lots and lots of time so i 've created a version of the elf in our mystery color which is orange sorry about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're going to have to code this anyway so let 's go back to the code screen oh it 's orange well let 's find out how we fix that because we want it to look black and white when we start our project don 't we so let 's begin by creating an event so we 're going to use the when green flag clicked button to begin and then what do we want to do we want to make sure that this costume is black and white so we 're going to go into looks just over here on the left so we 're going to switch the costume to elf a so that means whenever this green flag is clicked it 's going to switch to elf a which is exactly what we want and the next thing we want to do is to start creating the guessing game let 's have a look i reckon we want to ask something don 't we which is probably what 's my favorite color so we 're going to have to go to sensing down here and there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's pop it under here and let 's ask what 's my favorite color can you guess my favorite color yeah let 's try that one can you guess my favorite color [Music] australian way of spelling color all right so that 's what we want to ask so what about the answers so if someone gets the right answer we want something good to happen if someone doesn 't get the right answer we want to get them to ask again to answer again so let 's go to the control area so we can have oh yeah so if something happens then something else happens we want to have two different options i think we 're going to use this one which is if something happens then this happens otherwise something else happens okay so if the answer is orange then we get the happy happy thing if it 's not orange we get asked again all right i think that 's the one so how do we ask well how do we make the answer orange let 's go to this operators area so we 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over so we want to change our answer from 50 to orange and we want to have answer in here so let 's go back to sensing because we 've got an ask we need an answer [Music] now i think this will make sense so we 're asking can you guess my favorite color and waiting for a response so if the answer to this question equals orange then something good is going to happen but what about if we get it wrong hmm we want to ask again don 't we so what do we want to say if they get it wrong try again something like that let 's just try it again maybe i 'll say something a bit more like a conversation that 's not it try again yeah that 's a bit like you talking to somebody and let 's see what happens so we 've clicked on the green flag so we 've got our elf asking can you guess my favorite color blue yep so that all works but nothing is going to happen [Music] if we get it right so we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where that orange elf comes in we 're going to change the costume so we 'll go back to looks and then we 'll go to switch costume to elf b let 's try that [Music] can you guess my favorite color blue was it blue no that 's not it try again [Music] that 's interesting [Music] ah we wanted to keep asking let 's go to control and click on the forever let 's put the forever in so that way it 'll keep asking until it gets the right thing [Music] so let 's click on green flag and see what happens blue is that the right one that 's not it try again [Music] aha that 's pretty good we also want to say something don 't we so i reckon we might want to say oh yeah this is snappy here we go as i say [Music] orange it is you 're quite the whiz yeah you 're quite who is [Music] and we 'll make it for is two seconds long enough you want to bask in the glory of getting the answer right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's click on the green flag again and he gets my favorite color aquamarine one of those colors that you find in paint sets is that right nope that 's not it try again orange orange it is you 're quite the whiz hey that 's pretty good i reckon we might want to add in some sounds now because you know oh actually you know what we should do we should change the background as well the background would look much more interesting if it wasn 't just a grid so the way we do that is we click on backdrops just at the bottom right corner of the screen and we 're going to look for something orange this farm is pretty orange yeah that 's seriously orange that 's almost camouflaged but if we change that and we click stop and then we click the green flag hey it 's still the farm so we 're gonna need to add some extra code so that it doesn 't just stay as the farm background and give away the answer so we might want to do the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the costume set to go back to alpha a [Music] and we can do the same with backgrounds you can 't see a backgrounds tab up here yet but if we click on the stage down where the backdrops are then magically the backdrops tab appears in place of the character tab so if we click on that we can see two backdrops which means we can choose between them in the code so let 's go back to the code click on the elf and there 's a bit of code here that is switch backdrop too now we don 't want to switch to farm at the start because we want it to be that boring grid one but we do want to bring back the farm at the same time as we switch the costume to the orange one so let 's drag that switch background backdrop to farm down here as well okay now let 's start from the beginning with the green flag can you guess my favorite color let 's try burnt umber that 's another one of those [Music] paint set colors burnt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not it try again let 's type in orange orange it is you 're quite the wiz it 's still not terribly exciting i think we should add in some sound so [Music] kind of like that kind of messenger sounding percussion that we used in our previous project which was knock knock 2. i seem to remember that was right down the bottom of the percussion tap conga that 's the one maybe we should try a different one let 's try tap conga oh yeah that 's quite good what about muted conga i think i like tap conga better yeah let 's try tap conquer all right so we 'll make that appear or that sound begin whenever our elf asks or says something so we 'll go to sound we want to choose the sound to tap conga 2. there we go and we want to put it just before it asks can you guess my favorite color now the reason we use start sound and not play sound until done is because it 's going to wait until the sound is completely finished before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound like i don 't know some laughing or some clapping we do all of the laughing all of the clapping and then ask the question so it 's a good habit to get into if you want everything to flow so what else could we use we probably want like a hooray sound and maybe a barrel sound for if we get it wrong so let 's see what other sounds we could find i seem to remember that there is a pretty good ta-da sound in here [Music] but you can use any sound you like there we go that 's the one i want and what about sound let 's find something that sounds kind of like you failed [Music] yeah that 's a good one let 's try oops okay let 's go back to our coding so we want to pop one in if we get things right so just before it says orange it is you 're quite the wiz so let 's start sound we don 't want orps because that was the sound but we do want ta-da and now if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ okay let 's try our project and see where we 're at just make sure all the codes on the screen and go all right so let 's try a color let 's just try plain old green the opposite to orange that 's not it and it sounds like it 's not it as well let 's see what happens when we type in orange [Music] oh that 's satisfying [Music] hang [Music] after it says ta-da because i mean it 's great that we 've guessed the color but you know it 's not amazing so we can probably find in our control area something that might oh here we go stop all [Music] let 's pop that in right after orange it is you 're quite the wiz and let 's start our code again hopefully this will do everything okay so we want to choose gray is gray the right color totally not what about um brown what about orange great and are we going to get another ta-da no so we are finished we have a usable guess your favorite color game pretty good i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free to remix this project remix other projects on marathon on home coders and if you have any questions or problems please contact us we 're very happy to help so thank you for joining us today my name is andrew and we 'll see you next time for maribyrnong home coders for maribyrnong libraries [Music] bye [Music] you"

    "text": "[Music] hi my name is andrew welcome to marabon on libraries maribyrnong home coders so today we 're going to make another knock knock joke so just like the first knock knock joke but the code that we 're going to use makes it all work a bit smoother and we 're also going to add in some sound so we 've got a blank scratch project here so we 're going to start by removing the little scratch cat by removing the sprite icon just down the bottom so we 'll click on the bin and it will disappear now we 're going to choose a background and some characters so backdrops if you remember we choose over here so we 're going to choose a backdrop let 's see i 'm going to choose a castle backdrop today and for our sprites so our characters i 'm going to click on choose a sprite here now i 'm going to choose some fantasy characters stick with the fantasy theme so how about a centaur and also and about a let 's see what we 've got how about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we want to set them up so that they are facing each other so i 'm going to change it so that the goblin is facing the centaur and we also might want to make them a little bit bigger so the way you make them bigger is make sure you 've got the right sprite selected so i have the goblin selected and i want to make him maybe twice as big so i 'll change the size to 200 instead of 100 which is the default there we go and i 'll do the same to the centaur so i 've clicked on the centaur and i 'll change the size to 200 and click away and there we go so i 'm just going to adjust where they are on the screen and to make them face each other i 'm going to need to change one of the sprites to face the other direction so the way i do that is making sure i 've got the right sprite selected and then click on costumes the tab up here on the top left of the screen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here to flip him around there we go so let 's go back to coding so we 've got our two characters who can do our knock knock joke for us we just just need to add some code now so we 're going to begin by adding an event so an event is something that starts your coding off so you need something to happen so in this case we 're going to choose when the green flag is clicked and what do we want to do at the start of a knock knock joke someone says knock knock i think we might make the centaur say knock knock so once again i 'm going to grab the when green flag clicked and then we need to go to looks this is where you can make characters say things so we 're going to make him say let 's say knock knock for two seconds we 'll keep it with two seconds so i 'm going to change the hello there to knock [Music] knock [Music] and instead of having our goblin wait for two seconds well he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'll click on the goblin so we want the goblin to know when the centaur has said knock knock so we 're going to do something called broadcasting messages so in the control area [Music] sorry in the events area we have broadcast and we also have this when i receive message so let 's have a look i reckon we need the centaur to broadcast the message first so we 're going to drag over this brick which says broadcast message one and wait so now that we 've broadcast this message so knock knock is the message goblin has to then receive the message and do something [Music] and we want the goblin to start doing things when the goblin receives the message so we 're going to start with when receive message one what 's the goblin gonna do the goblin 's going to say who 's there so the goblin is going to have this piece of code here so it 's in the looks area and it 's say hello for two seconds we don 't want the goblin to say hello we want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the centaur to know when the goblin has asked who 's there so we 're going to broadcast another message so let 's go back to events and we 're going to drag over this broadcast message tab actually we 're going to broadcast one that says broadcast message and wait [Music] we 're going to broadcast a new message so you just click on the drop down here and click on new message we 're going to call this one message [Music] right message to just so that we can keep track of the order of everything you could call it who 's there it 's up to you whatever works best for you so we broadcast message two and we 're gonna wait and we 'll go back to the central so the center needs to receive message too i reckon we should have also done oh there we go we have centaur that 's all good now when central receives message to this is a new block of code centaur is going to say centaur for two seconds is this going central okay and then we need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so we 're going to broadcast another message so back to events so let 's broadcast something else so we 'll drag over the broadcast message to and wait but we 're going to change it to a new message this one we 're going to call message 3 and okay now the goblin is going to receive message three this is starting to make sense okay so when the goblin receives message three what is the goblin going to do the goblin is going to ask sent or who so let 's click on looks and drag across the say hello for two seconds [Music] and type centaur [Music] almost at the punchline and then we want to broadcast another message so that centaur can receive it and know when to say the punchline so let 's go back to events and broadcast message to and wait let 's press the drop down and create a new message now we 're up to message four now message whoops [Music] my spell correctly message four there we go and now we need the centaur to receive message for so let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so when the centaur receives message four i think we 're going to hear our punch line so let 's go back to looks [Music] and the center is going to say i can 't believe you forgot who i am i know it 's hilarious exclamation mark in there all right so i 'm going to press the green flag and we 'll see what happens knock knock who 's there centaur sent or who i can 't believe you forgot who i am ah awesome that 's really funny but there 's no sound so we 're gonna learn how to add some sound now so i reckon it might be good to have some sound that sounds like a tap like when you get an instant message so we 're going to click on the sound area just here over on the left and we want to play a sound so we 're going to use this code start sound start sound allows the sound to play over other actions that we already have in our code now we 're probably not going to want this sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ [Music] yeah that 's probably not what we want to hear when they start talking so we 're going to choose a more appropriate sound so to do that we click on the sound tab which is up here on the left and go right down the bottom and there 's a sound button just like the sprite and the backdrop buttons that you 've used before we 're going to choose a sound now i was thinking that it wants to sound a bit like an instant message so let 's go to percussion which is beats drums all that kind of thing and let 's try a few different drum beats how about a low conga a muted conga high hat beat nuts no there 's lots of sounds there all the snaps pretty good that sounds like an instant message [Music] yeah i feel like i should be checking my phone all right we 're going to select that one so just click in the middle and now this sprite so the central has the ability to use that sound so we 're going to have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we get if we want them both to have that sound so we 're going to change snort to tap congo let 's try this again [Music] yeah that works so i think we should add that every time the centaur says something so let 's just click over here and we want the start sound tap conga so we 'll add it just before he says something on each of these bits so now every time the centaur says something there 'll be the tap [Music] yeah that 's pretty good now we need the goblin to do the same thing so if we click on the goblin [Music] and we have a look and see what sounds we have we 've got the options of fairy dust but not much else so let 's click on the sounds tab and let 's add the tap conga to our goblin so click down the bottom with choose sound percussion is where we were looking and i seem to remember tap congo is right down the bottom yep there we let 's go on that and now tap conquer is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's go back to code and now we can add the code start sound tap conga just before the goblin says what the goblin is going to say we can snap that into both bits so let 's try our animation and see how it looks [Music] fantastic now i reckon we could make it a little bit more interesting by adding a laugh because you know it 's good if you get a laugh at the end of a jug so our centaur is the one that gives the punch line so we 're going to add the laughter to the center so let 's go back to the sounds tab and see what sounds we can find so let 's choose a sound [Music] oh we want voices so let 's click on voice i can see crowd laugh i can see a few laughs there let 's try [Music] that 's not a very enthusiastic glove that sounds a little bit crazy let 's try let 's try that crowd oh yeah yep that 's the one let 's do that one okay now we can go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's pop it down there i think that 's probably the right spot to do it timing wise all right let 's try our finished animation ah fantastic that 's a hilarious joke so everything you 've learned today will be online on our scratch studio which is marabong home coders and i 'm going to call this project knock knock 2. so if you can 't remember how this code goes you can go straight into knock knock 2 and you can even just remix the project and change the joke and have a bit of a play around with it so we 're going to call it knock knock 2 and i 'll probably give it some sort of silly subtitle as well so everything there is online for you to have a look at and i hope you 've learned a lot and that you 're having lots of fun with your coding my name 's andrew thank you very much for joining us bye [Music]"

    "text": "hello junior coders and welcome to a special edition of marambino home and we 're going to be using scratch junior today something for the little ones so if you 're about five maybe even if you 're four i reckon you could do this if you 're four anywhere from about four through two or seven or eight or 15 or you know 40. this is a really really fun way to introduce a bit of coding to kids and to older people as well so and it 's also national science week this week so i thought that we would make a bit of a seascape because the theme for national science week is the deep blue sea and a lot of it is all about what is happening in our oceans so why not do a bit of a seascape where we can have some aquatic animals and we can code them and move them around and we can also have a bit put ourselves in there as well does that sound like fun and i 'll show you how to take a photo of yourself and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there as well all right so the first thing you need is that scratch junior app and i 'm sure that you 've got it downloaded already so here we go we need to make our project so we 're going to click on the icon there and start a brand new project and here we have our scratch junior kitten i don 't think kittens live under the sea do they no kittens do not live under the sea so what we 'll do is we 'll get rid of our scratch kit in there you just need to press on him and a little icon comes up and blip off he goes there we go so here we have a brand new stage and we need a background so let 's click on the background at the top there you can see that little icon next to the abc we 've got to go and find our underwater scene can you see it there well that 's not it where is it oh there it is okay so we 've got our underwater scene there and then we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will put it into our new project woohoo there we go that 's a great underwater scene isn 't it fantastic all right i can see lots of coral in there and lots of things and some light coming through from the sun up in the sky looks like it 's a nice you know barrier reef or something like that happening there alright so we need to put some characters in so you 'll see the characters on the left hand side there where it 's got the plus there and we need to go and find some animals that live under the sea so let 's go and do that now and what can we find so let 's move down here this is all this is where all of the characters in scratch junior are so what have we got oh here 's some down here here are some things that live under well that 's a butterfly that doesn 't live under the sea does it well we 've got some fish and things here so let 's put a few of these in shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fish all right let 's put you in green fish so you need to press the tick and that will take us into our into our scene there there we go pop that in there fantastic that 's our first animal in there let 's find some others what have we got well yeah we 've got a starfish it 'd be great to have a starfish in there too you can go down there that 's loads of fun i wonder what we 'll make our starfish doing this what else have we got a yellow fish yeah we 'll put you in there too remember if you have all the characters here you have to actually code so depending on how many you want i don 't think we 'll have a frog frog 's not very well they are kind of semi-aquatic but they don 't live in the deep blue sea in the deep blue ocean but this guy does hello mr whale it 's good to have you with us there you go you can go there and we 'll see what you 're going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yeah let 's put oh should we put the crabby in or this or the seahorse let 's put the seahorse in there we go into mr seahorse all right so i think we want to be there too don 't we but you know we 're humans and we can 't breathe underwater so i think we 're going to need to be scuba divers let 's go see if we can find a scuba diver i think i saw one before let 's hear all the people if we spoiled it there it is can you see it there there 's that scuba diver there let 's put that one in all right there we go scuba diver that doesn 't look like me though does that look like you can 't even see your face at all there would you like to put your face in there you know you can i can i can teach you how to do that so see how we 've got our scuba diver on the side there on the left if you click on that little paint brush icon there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for all the different sprites and he can do all sorts of things woohoo look at this isn 't that fantastic so look at all those different colors there and different lines and all the different things that you can do and you can have a bit of a play around with that later if you like but for this for now we 're going to actually i 'm going to show you how to put a photo of yourself in that face there so the first thing you need to do is look for the camera icon and you might need to find if you have downloaded the app you just need to make sure that your camera is enabled so it might tell you that you need to go to settings to do that but anyway if you have got that enabled it should work so if you press on the camera icon there we go now put your finger on the face where the face would be and it 's going to bring up the camera have a look at this oh here we go there we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i 'm going to turn it around and show you how to take a photo of yourself there we go oh gee i look a bit funny don 't i ah there we go okay we 'll take a photo there we go and i 'm gonna go snap and that 's what it 's gonna look like oh dear oh well that will have to do i think what do you reckon i 'm sure yours probably looks a bit better than mine but that 's okay i don 't mind let 's look let 's go swimming in the deep blue sea all right before we do that how about yeah i might actually change a bit of color here so what i need to do is you need to click on the paint icon there that 's just underneath that camera icon we 'll click on that and then we 'll go down and just pick a color any of the colors that you like i 'm going to pick pink i think i think i 'm going to pick the pink one so i just put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm going to change the color of my flippers they 're going to be pink and i might change the color of my my vest as well there we go that 'll do for me today but you can go in there and change all sorts of colors and if you don 't like it you see those arrows at the top on the left there you can go back and forward as well and try all sorts of different things out but for now let 's put our selves back in the picture there we are so there i am that 's a bit better than just a plain old white face with nothing in it isn 't it all right so we 're ready to do our coding now so for this exercise we 're just going to use the trigger action for each individual camera camera each individual character so that 's going to be in them in the trigger blocks which are the yellow ones we 'll start with a fish so we 'll click on the yellow blocks there click on the yellow box and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it that 's it okay so every time the fish 's fish will only move when you tap it let 's put go before with a bit no just how many i don 't know five six yep that sounds good you can just kind of choose how many you want to go we might go so we 're going to go right and then we 'll go up and then we 'll go down a few more there we go how else will we go a little maybe we 'll try that first and see how we go there we go woohoo we 've made our first move fantastic you know what though maybe we 'll mate we 'll go back as well and see what happens just try that again click on the fish with your finger let 's go [Music] there we go up down oh we 're gonna go back again woohoo fantastic all right so if you want to reset it you just need to press that green flag at the top there there we go all right so we have to code everyone now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whale doing i think maybe the whale can probably just go all the way across the screen so let 's do touch the tap again let 's go back to our motion blocks let 's go right we 're going to go our 12 i think is probably enough there we go let 's give that a go whoa he goes nice and slow doesn 't he yeah that 's pretty good all right okay so what are we going to do with our seahorse we 've got to get that in there get you but that 's the thing about cody you 've got to remember to start it somehow otherwise it won 't work yep let 's go up oh yeah 12 will take us all the way to the top shall we try that ah that 's fun isn 't it it 's like he 's floating up to the sky all right let 's try that again i think oh yeah let 's bring him back down again i think that 's a good idea off you go let 's try again ready click that flag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back down again fantastic [Music] all right now we have to do the starfish now i think we 're going to make the starfish twirl around and around and around and i 'd like the starfish to twirl around and round around while everybody else is being tapped so what i 'm going to do is actually put this loop in here i 'll put you down there mr starfish this is a stop loop but it means that it just goes back to the beginning of the script and it just keeps doing it just keeps doing it over and over again so let 's see what that looks like look at that so you can see that it keeps going from one to the other and it just keeps spinning spinning until i hit the flag at the top and then it stops won 't do it again until i tap it anyway but we 've got it now we 've got a code me and you so we 're going to have a bit of a swim around in the deep blue sea as well yeah let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bits and then we 'll go down a bit yeah five of six is enough that 's fine and then we 'll go up a bit what else are we going to do shall we try that oh and then we 'll go back again yeah that 's a good idea all right let 's have a go tap on yourself woohoo so much fun oh isn 't that great fun oh i think that that 's marvelous what do you reckon how about that you guys actually did some real coding i 'm just going to move it around again and have a bit of a play you can have a bit of a play with all of your different characters there move them around a bit i 'm just moving those with my fingers you can do that here we go well that is so much fun isn 't it i hope you enjoyed that today have a bit of a play with it and and see how you go with it all and i just you know if you want to um make up any any of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of and you can do lots and lots and lots of different things with it too mum and dad if you want to go to the scratch junior website as well it 'll give you some more ideas and in actually in the app you 'll find some other projects that you can make as well so i hope you enjoy it i hope you have some fun coding and i hope you have a great national science where you can do lots of different science activities see you later [Music]"

    "text": "hi guys welcome to the fifth lesson of our lettering course i hope you have taken some time to practice the previous lessons and have become familiar with lettering and its different strokes today we will start to sketch our final piece so what i want you to do is to think about some ideas for your piece my recommendation is that you choose a shared phrase that has a maximum of three words i recommend this as creating a good composition with lots of words can be quite hard quite confusing so to start just pick something shorter and eventually start experimenting with longer sentences my process always starts by writing the concept i want to talk about and then i try to make at least 10 different sentences with the same concept i do this because somewhere combination don 't look really good so sketching different ideas allows me to see which one has the most strength and potential to become a good piece of lettering another detail that must be considered is the language in which our piece is going to be written english is a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single language for example i 'm from colombia and my native language is spanish and so often i have the problem of sketching the same phrase in both languages spanish and english but the results are completely different sometimes looks really great in spanish and then it 's it looks terrible in english so and sometimes it 's the opposite so it 's something that you should consider i think that this part of the course is the most fun since the possibilities are endless and i can make more relaxed strokes without overthinking sometimes even interesting ideas come out of accidents so try many options of sizes strokes and so on okay the next thing to do is choose your three favorites and think about which one has the most potential for your final piece if it 's necessary sketch them again until you are convinced and happy with one of the options and prepare everything because in the next video we are going to do our final piece okay guys see you in the next video bye"

    "text": "hi president samara madam it 's sarah here your mayor i just wanted to catch up to say that we adopted our budget for the 2020 21 year period and at the outset I 'd like to say thank you we did more consultations than ever before and so many of you during what is a really difficult time took time out to read the budget and it 's not a short document to provide commentary to us whether it be through working groups committees or on our website or city your voice and what you did give us was a lot of food for thought council had proposed with the draft budget to set aside to quarantine the 1.9 million dollars that would be taken up from the 2 percent rate increase our plan is to redistribute that and we spend a lot of time looking at the modeling and the numbers the thing that 's really clear to us that came through strongly is that whether you 've lost your job whether your hours have been decreased whether you 've had to shut a small business or whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that home everyone is doing it really really tough we know that we hear that and so council has decided for the first time in history as far as I can remember not to take up the rate increase so we will not be taking up the 2% that means a 0% rate increase for this financial year we hope that this affords residents and ratepayers some assurance that things might be a little bit easier we know it 's really difficult we 're continuing and we 'll do an evaluation review of our budget monthly at this stage to look at further ways that we can support the community with relief measures so what does the budget include well and forgive me well I refer to my notes because there 's a lot in there it 's a budget of a hundred and forty nine point seven million dollars we haven 't shied away from the ambitious capital works program that was proposed in the draft budget quite simply because it is a stimulus measure and with the rate at which our community is growing we need to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and into the medium and long term future some of those major projects and these ones to get really excited about that is still in the program of the red quest fullscreen redevelopment the Maribyrnong Aquatic Center redesign the next project action plan really excited about that one climate the emergency plan prepping preparation the healthy and active framework development bicycle infrastructure implementation something that the community have said that they really want the volunteer strategy the local government foots great activity center review there 's a whole lot happening including 300,000 worth of grants for arts organizations in the city of Merriman all we know during this pandemic how important parks and open space are so we committing twelve point five three five million dollars for parks open space and Street scapes in capital improvement works and also Street tree planting twelve point seven to 1 million to improved council owned roads across the city its core business be council but really important and three million dollars to building improved footpaths and cycleways 650 thousand dollars for off street car parks the list goes on what I would say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the website if you want to have a look at the budget that has been adopted but just know that we will continue to review this budget because we know that this is an ever-changing landscape with the pandemic in place and with further shutdown so from me to you please wear masks as from Wednesday night it 's compulsory let 's do the right thing we 've got some way to go but if I 'm certain of one thing is that we will get through this as a community thank you"

    "text": "hey guys welcome to our lettering classes this is our first video and our main goal of this class is to get a piece like this one but with your own style so I will give you some tips some advices on also I will eat you some techniques to do it so my very first advice is be patient because I know some people that after the first try they just give up because they have no the result that they are waiting so be patient I am sure that if you keep practice everyday you will get much better every day so and you will see you notice how much and how fast you improve okay so first thing that we need to do is draw some horizontal lines leading a space between each line of two and a half centimeters you can use this soft thank you I will recommend you to use recyclate paper not only because of the environment but also because after you practice it just became rubbish so I think it 's it 's much better if you can get some recycled thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's our first five basic strokes and those strokes are the basic and the structure for all the letters in the alphabet so please pay attention to all the specifications okay to make our strokes all we gonna need is our marker our brush pen marker that we can use we can get it at any of his work so the important thing about our market is having this in mind when we are going down we put pressure in the in the marker and when we are going up we decrease the pressure okay so let 's started with our first stroke is just this simple line going down and as you can see it has a soft diagonal and also it has an angle in the top and the bottom part so we can do this one and we can add this small stroke at the end it 's a small finish okay so in this case we have two movements the first one is going down so we put pressure in in the market and then we decrease the pressure going up that one is the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is we 're gonna add in the pin the top part of the line and extra guideline so in total we have a space between each line of three and 2 centimeters and the stroke is basically the same just quite longer and as you can see it 's the same movement the first one is going down and the second one is going up one and two and the only way is just one line of diagonal and with a soft angle in the top and the bottom part the third stroke it 's something like a letter C so you can see in this level we have three different movements the first one it 's a soft one then we put some pressure going down and then going up and decreasing the pressure one two and three movements what I do normally is put a name of every stroke in the first one for me it 's an letter I the second one is a letter L and the third one is a letter C then in the next video you will see how with these basic three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half of it okay so what I want you to do is put the old line with the same stroke okay so fill all the line you can you can mix between the simple one and the second one with a different finish okay also with the C and what I recommend is after this if you if you like this exercise you can use a simple sheet to feel all the with the same stroke okay so to make our last stroke we take our new paper sheet and draw again the same lines the first one we 're gonna leave a space of 200,000 hitters but with the last one we are going to practice a small stroke so in this case we are going to leave just a small space of one centimeter between each line okay then we take again our our marker this in this in this case do this next stroke we 're gonna start from the left to the right so as you can see it has again three movements the first one is going up then we are going down so we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finish that we put in the other letters then again practice the same okay then let 's go with the last one again we can feel all the line with the same stroke just to practice just to notice if we are going if we are going well or maybe if we are making some mistakes okay the last one it 's just a small finish it 's very similar today Finister we have been doing in the other letters so as you can see it has to it has a finish like a triangle you see then one exercise that you can see with this specific stroke is throw with the other with the other part market you can control the shape that you are seeing when you travel take with marker so just notice and be sure that you are doing it well"

    "text": "[Music] hi my name 's andrew i 'm one of the librarians at maribyrnong libraries today we 're going to learn how to make our own animated knock knock joke using scratch coding so to do this you 'll need to go to scratch.mit.edu if you want to keep your work you 'll need to create an account and you 'll also need a knock knock joke so let 's get started okay now that you 've got your knock knock joke we can create a new project so to do that we click on create just up on the left top side of the screen now our project will load and we have our project page so on the left you 'll see different types of code that we 'll use later there 's also a tab for costumes where you can change what your sprites which are the little characters that you use in scratch look like and there 's also a sounds tab so on this project we 're not going to get into sounds but we are going to use costumes and coding so let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is this little square right here on the right side of the screen so i 'm going to click down the bottom on this sprite 1 image i 'm going to click on the little bin symbol so we 'll click on the bin and that will delete our little cat now for our joke we 're going to need a backdrop so your knock knock joke might be in a swamp or it might be somewhere in the street so there 's lots and lots of backdrops to choose from now i 'm going to go with kind of a frozen theme and i 'm going to choose the arctic so i 'll show you that again so to choose a backdrop you click on the bottom right side of the screen just on this round part and you can choose from lots and lots of backdrops so we 've got basketball courts bedrooms farms deserts the city at night underwater there 's lots and lots of options so we 'll go back to arctic and now we 'll need some characters so to do that we click on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the background so we 'll click on choose sprite now i reckon i 'm going to choose well if it 's a frozen theme we 're going to need a princess so i 'm going to choose this princess so she now appears on the stage i 'm going to move her over here and we need something else that looks kind of like it belongs in the arctic let 's see i 'll try an animal aha a hair it looks like an arctic hair so i 'm going to click on that one and move the little arctic hair over that arctic here is looking pretty small but we can change the size so you 'll notice that down here you can see the hair icon is highlighted so our hair is selected and i 'm going to make this hair twice as big so instead of 100 i 'm going to change it to 200 and then click on the stage and magically our hair is a larger size also at the moment our princess is facing the wrong way this is where costumes over here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i 'm going to click on the costumes tab oh but i haven 't changed which character i have so i better go right down the bottom here and click on princess and now i can see the princess i want to turn her so she 's facing the opposite direction so what i 'm going to do is this button here which is flip horizontal which means it will change here to facing the other way if i selected flip vertical should be upside down which looks hilarious but we want her to be the right way up so i 've clicked flip horizontal and now she 's facing the hair so we 've got our characters we 've got our background now we can start coding the first thing we need to do is decide what begins our code so to do that we go over to the events section of the coding tab so the coding tab is here if you 're still on costumes so we go to events and click on events and you can also scroll through the different colors which will do different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really cool control well it 's kind of what it claims to be it controls what happens so all those other bits of code can be added to the controls sensing so when different things happen when different actions happen that that you might control or the program might control it will change various things operators so it can pick random numbers and all sorts of things variables you can get it to well we won 't go into that too much for this project and my blocks we 're not going to go into that so we 're going to start off with an event so we just want our an animation to start so i 'm going to use this when green flag kick is clicked so that means when somebody presses the green flag your animation will just play so i think the first thing we want to do is have someone say knock knock yeah okay so we 're going to click on looks and the first thing that we have on here is a say bit of code so we don 't want to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we want to say it for a certain amount of time see if i click on there it says hello pretty good and because we 've got the princess selected all this code that we drag in here belongs to the princess so i 'm going to drag this say hello over here just underneath the when clicked bit of code and it will snap together so instead of hello we want to write knock knock there we go and two seconds seems about right let 's click the little flag and see what happens aha we have a princess saying knock knock now the hair is probably going to want to say who 's there that 's usually the way a knock-knock joke goes so if we go down the bottom of the screen and instead of princess we click hair we can add hair um sorry code for the hair so we 're going to click on events again because we want it to start at the same time so we 're going to drag over when clicked now what do we think we want to do here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same time we might want the hair to wait a little bit yeah so we can go to this control section just down there and there 's a handy weight bit of code so we 're going to put it down here now if we click back on the princess she talks for two seconds so we probably want to wait at least two seconds before the hair says something so i 'm going to change it to 2.5 seconds and then what 's the hair going to do the hair is going to ask who 's there so how about we go back to looks which is just up here and drag over the say for two seconds a bit of code and let 's change it to who 's there and we need a question mark there we go so now the hair is going to say who 's there for two seconds and we 'll see if 2.5 seconds is long enough to wait between them so i 'm going to go up here and click the green flag knock knock who 's there all right so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next thing we might want to do is have the princess answer the hair so the princess is probably going to want to wait so if we click on princess we could go back to the control section and get her to wait now that 2.5 seconds seemed to work really good so i think we 'll do that again 2.5 seconds and then what does she say well here 's the rest of the joke she 's going to say scold scold okay scold where 's this joke going i wonder if anybody has figured it out so she 's going to say scold for two seconds let 's click on the flag and see what happens knock knock who 's there scold do you think the hair is going to say something now i think the hair needs to say something now what about scold who but first we need the hair to wait for 2.5 seconds so we click on the control section over here drag over the weight one seconds box and change the one to two point five and then we click on looks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're going to change the hello to scold who all right let 's click on the green flag and see what happens knock knock who 's there it 's gold it 's gold who oh okay we 're almost there so we need the princess to say something now so she should wait 2.5 seconds we 're going to click on the control button again and drag over our weight for one second block and change it to 2.5 seconds whoops 2.5 seconds that 's better and then what 's she going to say let 's go over to looks and we 'll drag with the say hello for two seconds but now she 's going to say the punchline and the punch line is scold outside let me in and we might even put an exclamation mark because i think it might be a little bit funnier so let 's have another go let 's click on the green flag and knock knock who 's there it 's gold it 's gold who scold outside let me in awesome so now we have created a really simple animated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than one way to code a knock knock joke so we have a scratch studio at marabong libraries and you can go there and see different ways that you can make knock-knock jokes so we 've got icebreaker which is the one we just did with added sound and we have knock knock 2 knock knock 3 and wizard side story so you can work your way through all of those and find out different ways of doing a kind of similar thing but you can do more interesting things and more complicated things which is really really fun so if you want to see how something 's done you click on the project and you can click on see inside yeah this allows you to look at all the code and on this one i have added some sounds so you could try doing that with your project as well and if i click on the hair you can see that i 've added some other sounds as well which is pretty fun you can also remix the project so if you don 't want to do all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit of a play and put your own joke in you can do a remix so to remix just go back ah right because i 've created the project i can 't remix it so i 'm going to have a look at someone else 's project and do remix from that so if i click bunny which is a very cool project you should check it out i can then press the remix button which is just at the top of the page and i can save it so if i wanted to call it awesome bunny and make some changes to the code i could do that and then i could share it with marabanong home coders on the scratch studio so that 's something else you can do nice work everybody i hope you 've had lots and lots of fun with this project and we 're going to regularly check the scratch studio and we 're really keen to see what sort of amazing hilarious stuff people come up with and i hope you have heaps of fun creating your own scratch code knock knock jokes bye for now"

    "text": "[Music] hi everyone welcome to Marin burning home coders we 're gonna have a great time today I 'm gonna run through some really great projects with you and hopefully going to have a bit of a go at coding if you guys haven 't done it before that 's absolutely fine this is for beginners so we 're going to have a really good time together I hope so coding is just so much fun I don 't know if any of you ever done any of it before but as well as being fun it 's a really great creative way to help learn how to solve problems did you know that it actually gets our brains thinking about how computers think and it 's heaps of fun at the same time it also helps us to persevere with problem-solving as well so sometimes with coding and the kind of coding that we 're going to do today which is heaps of fun the and to look for different ways of solving problems so it 's a great great skill to have and it 's a great great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit of a play with block coding which is what we 're going to do today on scratch the junior now scrapes junior is a free app that you can download from the App Store onto your iPad or iPhone or you can download it from the Play Store onto your Android device as well so if you want to go there and have a look for those apps first of all and then you can come and have a bit of a play with me does that sound good so apart from needing the app for this session another great resource is a book that we have at the library finally or not we do have it it 's called the official scratch junior book and it 's got loads and loads and loads of projects in it and you can borrow it from the library I 'm popping it up on the screen now [Music] library so if your local and you want to borrow it you can ring up and place the reservation we 'll get it out to you how does that sound the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunnah coding cards again they have low they 're free as well I 'm going to put a link in the description and there 's heaps and heaps and heaps of fun projects on there as well alright so let 's get into our projects our first project today is called us cue forest let 's make it together shall we all rise okay so the first thing you see this screen here is scratched junior screen you press the home button I 've got a few projects up there already but what we 're going to do is go through here 's the spooky forest project that I 've made already and I 've made it big and here 's what it does oh look at the frog bounce around and they 're back flying up so it 's upside down what does the snake do it goes big and small all right let 's have a learn over how we 're going to do this shall we first of all we 're going to start a new project there we go and we need to go and look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ background there there we go that 's good now we 're going to get rid of our scratch cat eye scratch cat we don 't need you for this project let 's put in some characters the first one we 're going to do is the Frog there is ribbit there you go mr. problem I 'll put you over there fantastic then we 're going to find what else are we gonna have we 're gonna have that purple snake aren 't we there it is the snake let 's put him over there alright mr. snake what else are we gonna have where 's that bat let 's put that bat in now and you 're going back all right we 'll just move you a little bit there right now here are our three characters now we 're going to have to put in the title here we go it is a spooky forest now I press that ABC button up there where you can see it we 're gonna change that to white and there it goes and let 's move it down the bottom just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there we go a spooky forest we 'll move these guys up here a bit there we go all right now here comes the Cody you ready to go let 's start with the Frog we press on the Frog now we 're going to use these buttons down here the first one we 're gonna start with is it says a little hand on a man who thinks that when we press the Frog that 's going to do something we 're gonna put in some motion blocks we 're gonna go around and around so the frog 's gonna jump up and down a couple of times and then we 're gonna use this red stop block to stop them okay on to the snake what are we gonna do with the snake again let 's use that start on tap button and or we 're going to use a loop for this one this is known as a loop we 're going to put that in there put our emotions in there we 're gonna grow big and then we 're gonna go small and we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop button as well and here is our bat we 're going to start again on tap here we go what are we going to do with this guy a few more motion blocks in the blue there we go we 're going to go round and then we 're gonna go around again actually I think that 's the wrong one no that 's okay we 'll make that let 's go around a few times eighteen times let 's try that and see how that goes and then we 're gonna go back again nope that 's the wrong one okay so we 're gonna use this one here fantastic alright let 's give that a go and we 'll put our stop block in there as well okay all right let 's give that a go and see if that works you ready we 'll make it big let 's have a look and I 'm gonna tap on the Frog there you guys he 's bouncing up and down oh and our bats flying around there it goes so he 's upside down how do we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small so there you go there is our spooky far oh that 's the sort of thing that you can do with scratch jr. now can you see if you can turn your back all the way around now I put in that middle one 18 times and it looked to me like it only made the bat go upside down once so maybe you can have a think about how many times he would put that in to make it go all the way around again that 's great and the other thing you might like to do with that project is to add in some more characters and make them do a few different things maybe you can find a bear or something like that to make it grow really big and really small like the snake how does that sound good one all right so the next project we 're going to do is to do a race let 's get a bit of a race against each other shall we now we know because we are the coders we know who 's going to win but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your friends and family they won 't know who 's going to win so let 's go it 's called the farm race okay so what happens is they go for risk oh and who 's gonna win oh it 's the rabbit isn 't it and the pig is going to come last all right well that 's good so here we go here 's the project and we 're gonna go back and make a new project press that plus button there we go now we need to have a background so we 're going to go in and choose a background there we go we 'll get that farm background I think but you 're gonna have whatever background you like really this is just to give you a bit of an idea of where to start with so we 've got to get rid of our cows again you can use the cat if you like to but we 're going to have to put him out there for the time being all right now first character is going to be that pig there we go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you up to the top there at the start fantastic now we need that dog this got dog 's name is scruffy hi scruffy way going I 'll put you there next to the pig and the third character is going to be that bunny rabbit there we go and you go mr. rabbit all right we 've got everybody at the starting line now we need to put start to put in our coating you ready so let 's start without pig now this time we 're going to actually start on the flag because this is the race and we start when the flag goes and everyone starts at the same time we 're is our motion one now they 're going to go this guy 's going to go really slow so he 's going to be the first one there and how many we 've got to go straight across so we 're going to move right and I kind of I think it 's about toil I think that that 's about enough to go to the end and then we have to put in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all ready to go let 's do scruffy hey scruffy we 'll start on the green flag again that 's right we have to remember every single one of them has to be coded properly for it to work you 're going to go medium because you 're going to come second we know that and we 're gonna put in our move right square and we gotta go 12 as well and then we have to have our stop lock as well all right you 're done mr. rabbit let 's go again we have to start on the green flag now you 're going to be the winner so you have to be the fastest let 's make you really fast and we still have to go with the motion and go twelve to get you to the end where everybody else stops and a stop block as well all right there we go there we code it let 's give it a go and see if this works hello let 's go here we go you ready press the flag oh the rabbit wins and the dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we go again fantastic we did that didn 't we that 's excellent you guys some real coders well done with that that 's fantastic I hope you enjoyed that I had fun making that one too now some of the things that you could do with the farm races maybe you could look at another project and see what else you could do with the speed blocks those speed blocks are pretty fun aren 't they see if you can choose some other characters to have a race with some new projects and the other thing you maybe even want to do is if you don 't like that backgrounds or any of the other backgrounds did you know you can actually even make your own so if you go to the backgrounds and you have a little or you can make your own background there as well and that is heaps of fun too to it as well I would bet you 'll spend lots a time making that you don 't also you can make your own characters as well if you don 't like any of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there too what did you think of that that was great wasn 't it all right get Cody okay and I also want to introduce you to our lives or be boss have you guys seen a bear but before isn 't this one little really cute you 're very cute now this is a little programming sequencing robot and he 's got special buttons on him and we 've got a mat that has got instructions on it and you have to figure out how many squares you 're going to go and how you 're going to go with that and that 's a really good way to practice computer thinking that 's right computer thinking sequencing is a really good start to coding so this little guy here you can borrow this one at the library all you have to do is ring up or when you place your reservation give us a call or email and we 'll be able to get it out to you we 've only got one so hopefully you won 't all come at once but it 's only for local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's got some of these and this is it this is exactly what he does already here you go [Music] [Music] [Music] would you like to have a play with him I think so too well it 's been great coding with you today and we might do this again sometime but I really really hope you have a go and you download that app and have a go at the coding because it 's heaps of fun and if you want it right in at library at Maribyrnong vou and let me know how you 're going and it 'd be great to see you I 'm Christy and we 'll see you again at storytime perhaps or at another program see you bye you [Music]"

    "text": "hello everyone my name is Kristy hi I 'm Linda we 're from the library it 's so great to have you with us today and first of all we just want to say congratulations on your new Bubba and welcome to the wonderful world of parenting and this is an information session basically for you we 're going to have a little bit of a chat to you about what the library can offer for you for your little baby and for your family and how to build some really really great early literacy skills and we 're gonna have a little bit of a bit of a play with the baby rhyme time and we hopefully hopefully will be able to see you in the library 's real soon how does that sound sounds great great yeah let 's get started yeah fantastic so first of all Maribyrnong libraries have story time and baby rhyme time and those two programs are specifically aimed at children from 0 to 5 so with your little one young new bond you 're very very welcome to come along to the library @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that both those programs happen weekly at our branches and baby rhyme time happens every week from February all the way through to the December so it 's great we get a chance to build relationships with everyone and watch your children grow and support you as you start on this new journey of yours fantastic so when it comes to baby rhyme time it 's aimed at children from zero to two which is actually fairly broad age ranges it is very broad but it 's a nice opportunity for all the babies and the toddlers to be together and you 'll be surprised at how quickly your baby will respond to being at baby rhyme time every week they actually start pretty early to register and recce songs and even us yeah fantastic so we basically just have some songs and some stories and rhymes or baby rhyme time so a lot of it is to do with rhyming and helping to really kind of submit those really basic things about our language and literature you know you know with our kids it 's also basically to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would you say absolutely and you may be thinking my baby is too young for all that but the important thing is is to start building the family culture now when they are little but this becomes part of what you do on a daily basis and remember and maybe you 're not aware of this but what you 're doing is actually starting building your child 's early reading skills you 're actually teaching them how to read yeah basically and without even trying so once your kids are a little bit older which will just happen like that trust me we have preschool storytime which is also every week at everything every one of their branches during the school term and that 's basically for the kids three to five years old and in that we have also stories and rhymes and songs and an opportunity to then maybe do a bit of creating but of exploring with various activities related to whatever the books are about yeah we tend to have a bit of a theme with that one too and again it 's got opportunity to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that age group as well so hopefully you 'll be able to come along and join in some of our library programs so it would be great to see you and Christine one of the great things about these programs is that they 're all free absolutely they are they 're all free and come along whenever you want to would be fantastic to see you so what we thought we might do today is give you a little bit of a little bit of a taste of baby rhyme time so usually what we have is we have you know maybe up to 20 or so families sometimes come to these sessions but we do have lots of songs and I 'm gonna play my ukulele for you as well and he said here 's a Hello song so this is a really good one too depending on the size of the group of course Lindell but it 's really good one to go around and get the babies names and you 'll see how quickly your baby responds probably already to their own name and how they love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends it 's time to say hello and then we go around and say hello to all the babies David so that 's so much fun so that 's one of the things that we often start with another one we love to do is head and shoulders knees and toes so where 's this is a good one for for getting your baby aware of different parts of their body and also for older children of course learning to move at different parts of their body that 's right and it 's also a really good song because it helps children to associate the sound of the word with the body part and it 's again it 's a good form of um getting those early literacy and with this sort of song you 'll notice that a lot of our songs have repetition and repetition is really really important for young children so these songs are really good for you to repeat it doesn 't matter how many songs you sing it they 'll style of it oh they 'll love it more let 's do it together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toes knees and toes head and shoulders knees and toes me and to get eyes and ears and mouth and nose mouth and nose mouth their notes eyes and ears and mouth and nose oh yeah yeah that 's a really great one to do it a bit of a silly version two of the kids when they 're a little bit older they 'll just just dissolve into giggle so much you can speed it up and slow it down have a bit of fun yep here 's another one this is a rattle so we only have one bringing there we go as a Rachel and opsite parents as we go and this is a shaker rattle way up high it 's a good counting one two because we thought all of these nursery rhymes and all these rhymes ah it 's great great opportunity to bring in some numeracy as well so addition and subtraction and all sorts of stuff so let 's go this my guys one two three four five shake your rats away up five six seven eight nine ten then we shake it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the right shake it and a breeze day and night shake is here and shake it shake it shake it oh I just threw that one and you know the beautiful thing about these songs is it doesn 't matter if you make up your own words it 's all about engaging it 's also about another good thing to do is to spend some time looking at your little one while you 're engaging in these songs because they they can learn to respond to your face and nonverbal cues absolutely alright thank you so much other things like this one okay open shut them open shut them give a little clap open shut them open shut them lay them in your lap creep them creep them creep them creep them right up to your chin open wide your little mouth but do not let them eat don 't shake them shake them shake them shake them shake them just like this roll them roll them roll them roll them blow loudly to kiss ah very nice all right we 're going up do you know this one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good idea I might do it yeah and here so we sometimes do actually a baby rhyme term you might find a librarian with the doll or a teeny because we do like to model as well so okay so we 're going to go up and this is a great one to parents if you want a bit of exercise to be honest and you know we 're going up and down all right you ready yeah we 're going up we 're going up as high as we can go we 're going down we 're going down we 're going way down low up up up up up up down down down down down so much fun that one isn 't it it is fun and that is a really good song particularly because when we 're going up we 're going up and we 're saying the word and now we 're making the action so your child is getting used to that that 's what up meets and when we 're going down we can move our voices down and go down a register @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you 're doing absolutely and you as first teacher it 's very important that 's exactly right all right shall we do Incy Wincy Spider Incy Wincy okay the one for the getting the little fingers moving it is now if you haven 't done Incy Wincy Spider since you were a child happen I usually do UNIX finger and thumb and put those together and then you can go around like this which is kind of tricky but the little violence really liked having keeping that ago or you can just go into students in spite ofor up your heart like this however you 'd like so loony okay they 're lying on the floor you can incy wincy up all the way all right let 's go Incy Wincy Spider climbed up the water spout down came the rain and washed poor Incy out out came the sunshine and dried up all the rain so Incy Wincy Spider climbed up the spout again and happy all right twinkle twinkle little star this is a good one for tracking as well if you 've got your little noob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can get them to follow your hands across their face as well it 's a nice peaceful nice place to work twinkle how I wonder what you the world in the sky twinkle twinkle you lovely well that 's just a little bit of a taste a baby rhyme time we usually do maybe 20 songs or so goes for about 20 minutes which is really quite enough at that age now sometimes you might have a little bit of a story or a little bit of a felt board or something like that as well and always finished with the tree always finished with a treat bubble oh yes of course we don 't hear that lolis no no no no bubbles bubbles bubbles bubbles everywhere fantastic so now we 'll just have a little bit of a chat to you about about basically about that early literacy stuff that we mentioned before and we 'll talk a little bit about rhyming so Ryman 's our readers that 's basically it so if you 're talking right that 's the beginning of learning how to read so babies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you guys as their parents are their best teacher and don 't forget that you are a very important part your their first teacher and you will remain their first teacher so even when they go to school and they have teachers at school don 't forget you 're still a valuable teacher to your child and always will be absolutely so the easiest and best way to promote language and early literacy development is to sing nursery rhymes in them we just sang a few so keep going and a great way to do that is in community as well but you know I 'm sure you that you 're probably already doing this said I 'm so good on you and keep doing it 's really important and remember you can sing the same ones over and over again it won 't matter they won 't mind that 's right in fact it actually becomes very easy for them to engage with you because that 's so with them and don 't forget that 's actually teaching them some early reading strategies as prediction so well done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so well and actually when we sing at all our speech slows down and so our babies can actually start to hear the syllables in the words a little bit better so I can say Incy Wincy Spider and I can just say Incy Wincy Spider but when I 'm singing it it sounds like this you see when see spider so I 'm breaking up those syllables so that 's why it 's really important to sing as well it doesn 't matter if you don 't think you can 't sing your child loves the sound of your voice Oh Christine yeah I 'm now grandmother my children can 't believe that I do baby right now because they think oh they let her sing and you know what it doesn 't matter they just want to engage with you and they will respond to your voice no matter if you sound that 's exactly right so sing away and it is very important to break up to slow down that speech so that they can hear the parts of speech a little bit easier so when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our children are learning new words they 're learning sounds they 're learning rhythm of the words they 're learning the patterns in speech they 're learning the syllables and the words as I said before and so and also if we include actions they 're learning about our bodies and their environment and the world that we live in as well so things like head and shoulders knees and toes so it 's really important to actually make connections between those but I 'll be drawing on those later on as they indulge further in books they 'll be able to say that 's just like that song that we sing about heads shoulders knees and toes well that 's just like in that rhyme that you say about Incy Wincy Spider yep and as I said before about repetition Lynden like another thing about repetition is that it really actually helps our children anticipate what was going to come next so they get used to it and they love being able to go I know what 's coming next and the tune when we 're singing it makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 'll draw on as they learn to read repetition teaches them how to predict because they 're able to draw on their knowledge of rhymes and songs that you 've been sharing with them since they were little yeah that 's right so this is a fact if children know eight nursery rhymes by the time they 're four they 're often amongst the best readers by the time they 're eight so that 's really not very much at all and when they start school you can often tell the children who have been read to and sung to from a young age because they already come to school with some of the exhibiting some of these skills of being able to predict to rhyme and to draw on other skills like relating events in books and events in rhymes to what 's happening in front of them in a book so they 're all skills but at this time even though you don 't realize it you 're actually helping us yeah that 's exactly right so books actually do really really help us build our vocabulary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really important so reading together makes reading a really fun thing for your children and because it 's interactive your baby is beginning to develop the skills they need to learn how to read and write later on it 's never ever ever too early to start never too early to start at all they 're probably not going to necessarily understand the words right now but they absolutely love your company and they love love love hearing your voice and exposing your baby to as much language as you can give them the best chance to be ready for learning later on yes and also apart from all the educational side of it it is just so special in terms of building that bond between you and your little ones and your family that this is something that your family values this time together to share bet agree to chat about the stories to spend time singing about what what is happening in the books because they say when they 're doing start school that 's something you 're going to have to be doing with them is reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daily life that 's one big hurdle you 're already helping them with when they start school because it 's just your family culture and it 's part of what you do absolutely so get them interested in books now right now as little as they are have them around the place use bought books in amongst their toys as I go they learned how to hold a book how to turn the page and become familiar with the written word as well now the library is a really good resource for you to borrow as many many books as you like basically you can try before you buy if you want to go as well it 's um we have loads and loads and loads of books for your children now at their age and we will talk about those in a second yeah we 've got if we 've got lots of little books here too or do you have an bit of a chat to you about how to select the right book but basically also reading aloud to your baby has so many benefits books like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not words that are necessarily used in everyday conversation there are the one that comes to mind Lendl for me is Humpty Dumpty sat on a few dog doo that 's that there 's a sound after you don 't often hear that Humpty Dumpty and it 's also special time where you can create a loving bonding experience as we said before which helps your baby to learn to focus and to listen and concentrate and very importantly to settle so choosing books would you like to have a chat about so this is one of our board books and what 's great about these is these can be handled by your children we actually want your children to be engaged with the book as well as engage with you as you tell the story so the board books are really great because it 's easy for them to tear them because they are made especially for young children so you can allow them to have a go at turning the pages to feel them and we have some that have flaps now who doesn 't like a fly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so not only opens this way but then it opens our this way this is a packet boo book for surprises so they 're going to love it because when you peekaboo they are so this is a really engaging book but we we want you to be able to give back to your child but them to engage in as well and to handle so these books are really good for when they 're really young because it 's really hard for them to damage them but you know what if they do I 'll if they love it to bits and it 's well loved don 't worry just bring it back to the library we expect that to happen these are a tool that 's right so when you are choosing books for your little ones so with the at your at the very little ones like zero to zero to six months we 're looking for books that have that high contrast so these like a Mike ones are pretty good they 're going to really be able to concentrate and see the images here this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but do you not say anything Christine well you can talk about all the little cool cats on that page and just engage your child and make up some stories perhaps and every time you open it you can change the story something different and make it about something completely different so we 're looking for minimum colors and simple images and black outlines and strong contrasts this one 's rather nice because it 's got beautiful black and white photos yep our families once your child is from after about six months through to about twelve months babies absolutely adore seeing pictures of other babies and also pictures of themselves and pictures of their families so this sort of book has spent but you could also might might like to make up your own book as well with photos of your favorite they would that 's what those kids absolutely love at that age and lift the flaps is really good at around that age group as well and familiar things oh here 's another one who doesn 't love The Gruffalo that 's right and this is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only has a flap but it has something beautiful to feel which is also a really important thing to give your child opportunity to feel different textures so this one is really really interactive and remember just because this is what the words say here doesn 't mean you can 't make up your own story to go along with it you might be able to make up the story that relates back to your experience in your children so I hope you 've enjoyed this little session today we 're really looking forward to welcoming you into the libraries and if you come and visit us we can get you signed up so I am joining the library is free free yes absolutely and you can borrow up to 70 items 70 items you might go wow we 're never going to do 70 you 'll be surprised you 'll be pleasantly and please feel free use the library it is the org library it is your resource and anything we can do to help you just let us know thanks for watching and we

    "text": "[Music] hello my name 's Andrew also known as big nose armed in this video I 'll be showing you a few skills and activities that helped me draw this video is mainly for primary school-aged children but it 's also useful for anyone who wants to learn to draw while I 'm talking let 's get you drawing now take a piece of paper I 'm using a3 paper and folding into quarters and what I 'd like you to do is use one of those quarters and start to draw some squares brought for you here and then I 'll start to waffle on okay if you think so they can be any shape any size and any different angle so while you 're doing that I 'll tell you a bit more about me I love to draw and I love to draw caricatures character tools or pictures of people that you can recognize would then make you laugh because they look a bit like a cartoon drawing people can be difficult and it looks really complicated I 've been drawing for a long time and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to change my drawing and make it better another thing that helps me draw is being in a comfortable place I like to draw on a board and in a comfy chair you might like to draw at a desk or a table or whatever works for you I also like to have everything I need closeby so I 've got lots of paper I 've got a few pencils now before I get you many give you any more hints and tips I 'd like you to do is separate drawing from this one I would like to D allow you to draw me a picture of einman from the adventures so that 's Robert Downey jr. but without his mask okay you 've got ten minutes go you I last used to draw the same picture at the end of the video hopefully it 'll be a bit better once I 've shown you how I draw so let me show you how I draw I have a live model with me here I 'm going to draw which is always good but you might have to draw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more about those later but the way I start a caricature of drawing is with the hair now you can 't draw every strand so I always start at the top where the hair meets the background and that starts to get a few lines in down to the ears and it 's a bit like a lego haircut that you wrap making sort of a little Lego piece that you put on for the Hat so I start off with the outside there and then a few lines to show the inside now you can 't draw every single strand so let 's just draw a few lines that show the direction of the hair and think about the length of your lines the direction of your lines and the angle of your eyes so once we 've got some hair in there I 'll move on to the eyebrows and again I 'm looking at the line of the eyebrow so that 's the top of the eyebrow there the bottom of the eyebrow underneath there I 'm looking at but again I 'm looking at the length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line and then I can put in a little bit of shading it 's a show that the eyebrows dark then I 'll move on to the eye and there 's a everyone 's got a crease for the eye socket at the top there then I 'll move down to do a line for the eye lunch and we can go of that and darken it up a bit then we can move in to do the highlight and I always once give a nice round highlight there and we 've got people looking shade that in a bit there too and then the iris round the outside and again it 's all circles but just look closely again at the length of the line the angle of the line and the direction you want it to go and then we can move down to the bottom eyelid that comes in around that side there it can add a little bit of shading in there as well maybe a little bit in just around the top there as well and then we can move it in towards the nose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side so again we look at the angle and length of the eye that eye line will look at one underneath and then we can fill it in the darkest areas and then where the light catches it a little bit then we can do the line for where the eyeball is and then come down to the eyelash line and again I 'm making a few ones and then I 'm adjusting them so I 'm sort of like making sure that I 've got one line and that 's going to be it I can go over it a little bit and I can either know a little bit of shading and I can tweak it and change it moving to do that highlight and then the pupil which is the black part of the eye and then the colored bit or the Irish iris iris a little bit of shading in there as well then we can come down bottom eyelash as well shading and shadow on it now rather than drawing drawing the nose and trying to draw a sort of big straight lines coming down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the nostrils and again I 'm looking for the length of the line the angle of the line the curve of the line everyone knows that nostrils are browned but when you actually look at them straight on they 're a bit more like an apostrophes or comments and you can start off with the line and you can just sort of like doodle over the top of it then we 'll come round with the outside of the nostril there as well we 'll do a little bit of shading for the bottom of the nose that 's the darkest part and then we can just do a little bit on the top it 's nice and gentle the top of a nose now our model is wearing glasses so I 'm going to draw those sort of over the top of these here we 'll look at where we can start which sort of in this area here for the corner and I can drove right over the top and again I 'm drawing several different lines but that 's really good with classes because you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then we 'll come back down here and the glass is maybe don 't quite quite go all the way to the bottom of the nostril but we 're drawing a caricature so that could be a funny part of the caricature and then we can draw the bridge if the glasses that goes over the nose there and then other side of the glasses and again they look those glasses looked really quite large going off the side of the face but that gives our sitter even more character than she 's got already okay that 's better I 've got a smile out of it with that bit and we 're coming down onto the mouth so we can draw that little bit under the nose down there and then what I 'm gonna do I 'm going to start at the corner of the mouth here and I 'm going to draw the top of the top lip then we have like a little valley that comes in there and then we go out to the outside all the way to the edge there again think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your line in the direction of your line now I 've not given my model a mustache that is just her top left the wall starts make more sense once I 've drawn in the darkest parts of the math so those are brown them right on the corners there and teeth usually the thing that most people find really difficult to draw but I draw teeth are not drawing teeth so I 've not drawn any teeth so far but we can see this wide area here he 's already starting to look like a big happy smile so I 'm just going to leave it at that I 'm not actually drawing it see if I 'm going to draw the top of the bottom lip that comes down here move it back across this way and just by doing that I 've drawn teeth we can put into little lines and angles there but I don 't think it 's necessary I think that looks cute as it is so we 'll draw the bottom at the bottom lip gain looking at the angle and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can fill a little bit in with a little bit of shading down the bottom here and a little bit at the top of that bottom lip just by putting much shading in we 've got a nice highlight there okay now we 're nearly finished the final bit is to sort of frame all those features and we 'll go back up towards the top of the eye there and we 'll start so it 's sketching a line or two for the jaw again I 'm doing a couple of different lines there just to adjust that first line that I put in we can put a little bit of shading in there as well and then we can bring it in underneath the bottom of the what for the chin and my models got a nice round little chin so put that in there we 'll put a little bit of shading in there too and then we 'll bring it back round on the outside here again I 'm looking at the angle and the direction of the line so what I mean the angle and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birds call is the land how much does it go across or how much does it go straight up and then we can round that in and back in its words the are there put a little bit more shading in on the cheek and just round the jaw line and then we can add a few bits of herring on the sides as well again you don 't need to draw every single strand we just need to draw sort of the general shape and line of what the hair looks like we can add in my models got earrings I don 't have to draw them at the eggs nice dangly ones so put in a few circles down there at the bottom and then a couple of lines just to show where the nut comes in and a little bit of shading underneath there and there we go that 's our caricature so I 'm going to start talking and explaining a few things but you can move on to the next quarter of your piece of paper and you can listen and you can draw a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again you can overlap the circles do them big didn 't small bit of fact then whichever way you 'd like to do them I 've been drawing for nearly nearly every day for 40 years and drawings like reading and writing you starts off with some basics so you learn letters size and shape of them how they sound on their own and how they sound together and drawing is quite similar only there aren 't 26 symbols to learn there 's only three squares circles and triangles so what you can do is you can move on to you from your circles and you can start to draw some triangles as well and again the same thing you draw some big ones ones that overlap some really tiny ones and ones that go all over the time that 's even out of the quarter as well so you can carry on with drawing circles and triangles and even squares as well and I 'll cut out shipmates show you what they 're for and how I use them in my pictures so circles squares and triangles and what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show you how I 'm how I make a face up with it so what you can do on a clean sheet of paper is you can draw a big square okay and that 's going to be the size and shape of a face what a the next thing that you can do is you can draw a line that goes straight through the middle of that square this is the eye line or the eyebrow line that goes straight across the across the face everyone 's eyes are generally in the middle now I can show you that you can take your pencil and you can measure from the bottom of the chin and then take the pencils at the top of the Arbor and that measurement is pretty much the distance between the eyebrow here and the top of the head next you can put a line in that there straight down the middle I 'm sure you can see that that 's going to be the nose part and again you can take your pencil and you can do it on your own face and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyebrow and that 's about again in the middle there and it doesn 't go to you wide the next bit that we can do is we 're about the man we 're about to the mouth is and again can take a measurement from the bottom of your nostrils bouncing your chin and again it 's about halfway in between there we 'll move back up towards the eyes now because the eyes are sort of those circles that we have and again another measurement you can take is from the nostrils to your eyebrow and the bottom of your eyes come in about halfway there and you can draw a sort of circle area to represent roughly where your eyes would go now the center of your eyes actually and you can again this is something you can measure on yourself or somebody else the sense of your eyes comes down and matches up with the edges of your mouth here so it gained Michael same before with the drawing that I did always look at the wall the length of the line the direction of the line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those bits to make little shortcuts the final bit that I 'll show you is the ears now that is if you take your pencil around from the outside of your eyebrow all the way around to the side and it helps if you if you can see somebody who wears glasses but that line is exactly out to the side here and will give you the position of your ears and then you can do the same measurement with the bottom of your ears if you take a pencil or if you learn a line all the way around from the bottom of your ear you 'll find that it ends up near the bottom of human and so you 've got a nice way to proportion things up now what what you can do is you can use this sheet and there 's a sheet on my website sigh and I 'll give you a link to it but you can use the sheet as guidelines but whenever you do a drawing so what we 'll deal with in our next drawing is we 'll take this sheet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we can use that to help us draw our next picture so the next rule and I 'm going to do and I 'd like you to do as well is using the guideline that we just did underneath with a piece of paper and get yourself either a model that it 's happy to sit down and now be drawn for ten minutes or you can get a photograph reference and you can use that so again we 're going to use those guidelines and we 're going to start off with the outline of the hair and my character of my reference has got curly hair and this always seems real difficult to do but if again if you just get the sort of like general direction and the general shape of the line then you can start to add in a few bits of that clearly have and again you don 't need to draw every single hair every single strand you can just give a quick impression of it so that 's the outside of the hair draw the inside of it as well so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about and looking at the direction of those lines the angle of those lines is it a bit more like a circle it 's the line a little bit square is it a combination of all of those we can put some shading in around those lines as well and again we don 't have to make it completely dark we don 't have to go back in and fill in all those gaps we 're just doing a quick drawing quit caricature get an impression okay so the next part and you can use those guidelines like I said I can see where my eyebrow is going to be approximately and it doesn 't have to follow those guidelines underneath exactly it just gives us a good points of work from then next was the top of the island and my lunch just going outside there bit of shading and there as well this shading here when we come in sort of in its Ward 's the nose it is it 's actually sort of like the inside of the eye and going into the sort of the bridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round circles or the highlight people and then the iris around the outside and by doing that and by drawing that top higher lash and then coming down to the one underneath I 've actually drawn the whites of the eyes as well to put some nice light highlights in there to give it a bit of bit of depth and then a bit of a shadow underneath the bottom of the eye there do the same on the other side rocks they 've got a few crease lines backs our character our model is looking a little bit worried in this photograph so again we keep splitting sort of right lines and then come down into a curve into a part of a circle there and that helps us with the next eyebrow on this side okay taught from the bottom of the eyebrow we don 't need to draw in every single hair of the eyebrow button skipping crushing there then we come to the top part of the eyeball that 's above the top my lunch and eyelashes quite long workings highlights and then people dark part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit of shading in there for that then a little bit coming in there then we can do the bottom I like a little bit of shading and underneath there as well okay and we 're down towards the nostrils and again we can use those guidelines that we 've had there before got the bottom of the nose coming in over here we can move that around a little bit and that 's the good thing about doing a caricature it doesn 't have to be like a photograph we can sort of move things around a little bit which will make our final picture look a little bit cartoony and a little bit funny now remember what I said about nostrils everybody knows sort of if you if you put your finger up there it 's burned but when you 're looking straight on it it is it 's more like an apostrophe or a comma or it 's just got that little bit of a flat circle so we draw the the holes of the nostril and at the outside of it and we can put in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then we can put in a little bit more shading around the highlights we can put a bit of shading into the nose as well maybe he wants okay and then working down here our model has got a little bit of a mustache but I 'm gonna move to those guidelines that we 've had before remember that one that dropped down it was about the middle of the eye the outside of the mouth you can use help us again move in for top of the top lip move down on the outside here again I 'm not going all the way to the edge of my guide line I 'm just using it to make sure that I 'm not going too far away and then we can be the bottom of that top lip put in some shading and I 've got a drawer in a little bit if that moustache did he stop going on a little bit on the outside a little bit in the outside there there 's a little gap where he 's opened his mouth I 'm just going to fill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that point that was started with the mark there the bottom this bottom lip looking for the direction of the line the length that that line goes to before it changes direction you then where it meets up with another line I can put some more shading in some dark shading for down the bottom of the lip here I 'm going to leave that middle part light because I can see that that 's where the light hits the lip I 'm gonna put a little bit more in the bottom there and a little bit underneath where theis let was created a little bit of a shadow okay the next part was go back for the outside here we can put in the outline of the jaw and again we can use those guidelines we 've got underneath to help us with the outside of the jaw there it 's not part of it and then where that line changes direction and comes in towards the bottom of the lip and then down underneath the chin chin moves and it moves around in our accounts it 's got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the chin and then up but the side of the cheek around there and then we can start work on the ear now in this picture we can see that see a big part at the side of this ear so conditioned and that 's nice and quite rare and we can put in fear those curls to the ear and a bit of shading as well a little bit more shadow on that side as well and we 're going to work this into our characters be it don 't worry too much again when you draw in any hair hair you don 't have to draw every single strand of it especially with dark hair it 's nice because you can just shade it or live that way I 've got a little bit more a little bit more shading on this side as well I 'm going to put a little bit of shading on the forehead just to represent my characters skin tone and again we can see a little bit of the air on that side will Tory a couple of lines coming down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 've got our sort of sketcher at the top and then you can work into the drawer in that way okay so everyone 's eyes are generally in the middle of the face and what we can do is we can measure from the side of the eyes here down to above the chin then we can see that 's about the length of my pencil and then we can take that measurement and take it up we can see that the top of the pencil is about with the top of my head so that means that my eye line is right in the middle here yes so the line for the nose of the nostrils is normally right in the middle of this bottom half that we 've got here so again we can take that measurement here from the nostrils now at the bottom of the chin and we can see that that measurement is pretty much about where the eyebrows are so you can put that nostril line in right in the middle between the eyebrows and the bottom of the chin right in there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the nostril to sort of the middle of the lips and again that 's very similar to the measurement from the lips down to the bottom of the chin so the top of the ears comes around from the eye line you can see that sort of like with me having glasses it makes it really easy see that that is where the top of the year sets and then the bottom of the year if we go around to the middle here sits where the middle of my mouth is so you can get that so you can have you is the ears in proportion on there was one more which was that outside of the mouth so they 're at very edge of the mouth does actually line up pretty much with the center of the eye so you can get that on both sides it 's helped with your guidelines okay so to wrap up while I 'm talking what you can do is you can go back to your that sheet that you got with circles squares and triangles and you can start to practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard to get some really nice dark areas and then really starts sort of like release the tension in your hand and get some really light areas so while you 're doing that I 'll do a bit of a wrap doodling and doing these little exercises with the squares triangles and circles it 's a bit like going out in the backyard and kicking the footy or catching a cricket ball it 's nice and it 's good practice before you sit down and do a real proper drawing or more a drawing that 's going to take a little bit more time and remember by going out in the backyard and kicking the footy or catching the cricket ball it 's great practice but when you have a match so remember with drawing drawing is a challenge it can be frustrating but it can also be very rewarding when it goes right so when you make mistakes just think of them as an opportunity to learn and to change those lines and to help you make it better drawing next time set yourself up to draw well so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plenty of pencils plenty of paper sometimes I 'll have music on I 'll have a drink close to hand so I don 't have to keep getting up and moving around too much so set yourself up do some really good drawing try and draw some pictures in about 10 minutes that way you won 't get lost in the details of sort of giving yourself an hour or just drawing for as long as you want if you set yourself boundaries then your drawing can be a bit quicker and you can complete drawings if you set yourself boundaries of 10 minutes or 20 minutes again use the face cut their face card lines that I 've showed you how to draw before that you should have drawn there 'll also be a link to a few of the resources like those face guard lines that you can go to my website and you can have a look at you can print off they 're everything that we see whether it 's drawing a picture of a person a picture of an animal or a picture of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so what you can do is even if you 're not drawing you can look at what what 's around you and you can see is that made up of a square is it a combination of the two and by actually sort of recognizing those things when you look at images and objects that will help when you can 't draw have another try at drawing Robert Downey jr. they eat it at the beginning of the the lessons and see if it how it compares to the one that you did at the beginning hopefully that you 'll see that there 's a bit of a difference and the difference will be that it 's better than the one that you drew at the beginning it doesn 't matter either way of whether it 's better or worse what matters is the e drawing and the practicing and the you having a go and the more that you draw the better you 'll get you"

    "text": "well I play AFL cricket I do nippers in basketball it 's fun to play you make great friends and it 's just really good to play I love the exercise and I love the fitness side of it I think the first year that I played we played for about half the season and remained at the bottom of the ladder and so about halfway through the season just Simon suddenly clicked and yeah so that first win about three years ago was you can 't describe him I love sport because it gives me a chance to get away from the everyday what I realized what I loved about it is the camaraderie that I had with my team members I think everyone likes to belong right I think that 's a big part is feeling like they 're part of something I think the biggest thing for me though was when I moved from primary school to high school and all of a sudden went from being a kid to all of a sudden being female and being a woman yeah I think there 's just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's a lot more challenges as to why they want to participate in sport so there was very little pathway past playing maybe you know University teams and there may be club teams where that was it so time is one factor cost is another the third thing is is a really difficult one and that 's a cultural barrier sometimes women have certain backgrounds who might find their access to sport sometimes restricted by cultural expectations and then I had a child and that unfortunately came with you know putting on 15 kilos or something and then trying to lose that weight yeah I 've got a friend who has had to or has felt the need to actually join a class that exercises indoors in groups rather than going out and running instead of her local park Corinne around the streets because it concerns about safety one particular time we did have our pre sort of match briefing he said you know it 's the girls I 'm not going to be too difficult for you in terms of throw-ins because I know you 're female and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know some incredibly accomplished women you know and to hear that sort of attitude spelled out or articulated makes us definitely feel like the effort that we put into place sort of gone two to nothing I think language is extremely powerful and as certainly as a young woman growing up you would hear the phrase you throw like a girl or you play like a girl and you didn 't want to play like a girl but those words do have an impact on your pride in being female and they 're also a constant reminder that you 're treated differently when you just really want to be treated like a person discussed amongst the male players as discriminated against for you know whatever sexual preference they are or if they are if they aren 't you might hear people make particular comments about what you look like in your sports uniform and so little things like cleaning up the clubhouse was automatically assumed to be a task that was you know something that the girls did if anything has to be cancelled it 'll be the women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can kick off on time yeah I think I was probably greeted with some reservation by some of the older older male members of the committee and of the wider club as well it 's probably not that common for a young woman to be making those sorts of decisions really important decisions reluctance maybe from the men in the club to take on the decisions that I 've made yeah they stand up in the middle of the meetings yell at you don 't point their fingers they need to make sure that if they are going to start developing a female component to this boarding club that it 's got to come from the top and it 's got to be born from within the executive or the club committee within the brains trust of the club so that every other piece of information that is filtered out more broadly to the lower levels of the club the players the officials everyone believes in it because the head of the organization believes in it 's clear I just think this it 's just meant to be equal it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rooms are meant to have the women 's teams photos up as well as the men 's I think that clubs will be improved if they don 't try and emulate their experience from when they were a child but actually look to improve the experience if you want to move into that area definitely see women its partners in the club you know don 't see them as look the main so you have to clean up the clubhouse actually having more women present at the club on the management committee or where that just be present at the club definitely I think would make it more comfortable for women but it 's also about sort of trying to address those barriers and address those things that actually prevent women from participating in sports so whether it might be providing childcare or adjusting the uniform there 's usually showers available but I don 't know many girls that would that shower in there because they don 't want a communal shower they just want at least a partition or a section off area I think we 're on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I think we just have to keep speaking out for ourselves people are malleable and they 're flexible and people inherently are good and they want to be able to bring good news to people 's lives and I 'll come with you on your journey if they appreciate and understand and I think what we 're trying to achieve now what we 're working towards now and every wouldn 't have been there if men and women have supported us on in June you"

    "text": "[Music] hi I 'm Rebecca from sin media and we provide broadcast opportunities and media training for young Australians thank you to Mary Byrne on counsel having us host this isolation creation series in today 's isolation creation listen media team myself and Beck will be taking you through how to record remotely and set up a DIY studio at home it 's a really great time to reach out to others and you don 't have to travel to a studio you can make one right at home some of these methods look really fun and are actually being used by professional podcasters and radio makers don 't worry if you don 't have any fancy equipment we 'll show you what you can use with everyday items let 's get started what important device that you will need to record your podcast is of course a microphone there 's a variety of microphones out there and we 're going to describe the pros and cons of each let 's stop with your inbuilt computer microphone as a general rule this should be your last resort but in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be useful for recording voice members and gathering little box pops headphone microphones so immersed of us would have a pair of wired inbuilt marble foreign headphones one thing you do need to be careful of with mobile phone headphones if they can get caught on clothing and might make some rustling noises also if you have long hair you might need to push this back behind the microphone a USB microphone these are quite handy because they don 't require audio recording interface meaning you can plug it into your laptop or your computer and pretty much get recording straight away they 're a bit more affordable than an analog microphone if you do have the money to invest in a good quality microphone analog would be the best closer to studio quality but they really just what are your nerds so working with in your budget had foreign microphones or USP microphone might just be the way to go importantly you don 't need to buy something really expensive just work with what you have a good tip is no matter what microphone you choose to use you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the microphone this will make sure the sound gets recorded directly into the microphone [Music] let 's talk about setting up your recording space you 'll want to record in a small room with lots of books and furniture to absorb the sound you 're not going to be able to get a studio quality sound proofed space but absorbing the sound can be really easy with just what you have around you but most importantly please make sure you 're comfortable and safe because you might be sitting for a long time if you become too warm or feel uncomfortable please take a break to reset and readjust hygiene remember to wipe down surfaces and disinfect a microphone sock with a disinfectant spray but never spray a microphone directly as moisture can damage the equipment it 's all about trial and error so use what 's around you and experimenting to create your DIY home studio can be quite fun these are some examples of podcast makers getting creative with their home studios [Music] hello Finn crew and welcome to my crib all my makeshift studio this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here I am one half of the coach coat on Finn this is our Instagram page home which we 've been able to update a bit more in isolation this is just a tiny corner of my room I chose this place because they will be the most sound dense and it 's a room with a lot of shelves a lot of clutter a lot of books and all the rest of it sorry this is how I 've been recording um this is my laptop obviously I record straight to audacity I don 't have any paid editing programs this has some equipment that I 've been borrowing um fancy word panel I really like the rainbow lights on it let 's have just some old pillars and cushions tie-dye is optional to further come record the sound this is just a little disc so I would usually use to get ready to make up whatever but I 've actually chosen it because when I sit down it means the microphone is still level um with my mouth some other things I 've been keeping handy over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they also have a built-in microphone usually so if you don 't have any external equipment um some sanitizer to keep my hands clean and some disinfectant spray to spray and wipe the equipment before and after um each you so I can return it in a nice clean condition this is some artwork optional it 's just something nice to look at [Music] now that you 're ready to record let 's run through some techniques remember to sit still and remove any jackets or noisy jewelry before you record a sensitive microphones will pick these up really easily if you have a pop filter this will help to catch any loud popping sounds which also referred to as plosives you might have heard some come through the microphone just now they 're a little bit pesky and really tricky to get it out so it 's best to avoid them before you record ensure you have your run sheet handy as this will act as a really useful production schedule and ensure you don 't run over time you can also record directly into any t aw that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any cable you have directly to your device also known as digital audio workstations there are three main da WS that we use for audio editing and recording these are Reaper audacity and audition we 'll be going through the pros and cons of each first up we have Reaper a great thing about Reaper is that there 's a free trial and if you do purchase a license it 's a one-off payment Reaper is quickly becoming the favorite da W for professional radio producers in Australia and there 's extensive online resources screen reader is also accessible so far with Reaper we haven 't come across any cons next up we have audacity it 's free to use and download there are no workarounds or special offers it 's free to go there are also extensive online resources and tutorials to help you navigate audacity and screen reader is accessible or dusty does have a few cons there 's destructive editing which means if something gets cut out it 's cut you also need to make sure that you 're constantly saving your work in saying that though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a particularly low processing power also audacity isn 't used in a professional setting however when starting out making a podcast or dasa T is a great place to start thirdly there 's audition audition offers waveform and multitrack view for ease and works well with the rest of Adobe Creative Cloud however there is a monthly subscription that can be quite expensive but it is used in a professional setting some other da WS that you can look into a Pro Tools Logic Pro Ableton GarageBand and Wavelab recording from home and creating a DIY home studio can be fun so get creative and use what 's around you you don 't need to have expensive fancy equipment or completely soundproof the space that you 're in you 'll still be able to make great content wherever you are keep an eye out for the next video on how to source sound as well as some editing tips [Music] [Music]"

    "text": "[Music] hi girls my name is Lena and welcome to this little watercolor isolation I 'm going to be showing you today how to make some really beautiful watercolor prints that you can put up in your room or your house or you can just do it in a little watercolor book and it 's just a fun idea for you to do while you 're in isolation so that you don 't go stir-crazy just being inside also a really great time to channel your creative juices so that way you can channel all that pent-up energy that you have into something beautiful this is also a good reminder to remind you to practice social distance so while you 're doing that you can be doing your watercolor by yourself inside and it 's just a good downtime activity to do you can even do it in from the TV if you want that 's what I 've been doing at my time umm also a quick reminder wash your hands before and after the activity for a minimum of twenty seconds you know how it is alright and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this activity you will need a pot with some water a pen so it can be any black pen of choice try to get one that is smudge proof when it comes to water these ones are from tama and they do the job just fine you will need a set of watercolors so we have an array of colors and of course you will need some paint brushes cool so once you 've got all your material let 's get started so the first one I 'll be showing is I 'm going to be showing you how to make a cactus so you want to start off by drawing the pot the way to do this is you want to draw a circle or an oval like this and you want to leave a gap here because that 's where your cactus is going to be coming out of right then on the bottom you want to draw a small line so that you create your pot from here you join the two lines and there you have it you have your pot don 't worry if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this exercise is just for you to start creating and making something blank turn into something beautiful once you 've got your pot you 're ready to draw your cactus so from here you can draw any type of cactus that you would like so for example I could draw one that has a bulb coming out here so you draw your bulb and then I could draw another one here and then you can get creative with it you can drew one that has a little leg coming out here and then potentially another bulb there you go you 've created a cactus how simple you 've got your shape then if you want to make it a bit more textured you 're going to draw some crosses along the lines okay so all along you 'll be drawing some lines little crosses you then to add a little bit more texture to the cactus you want to add some little V shapes like this all along again doesn 't have to be perfect just draw the V if you want to start off this with pencil you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your colors so like I said you will need your pot of water and then any brush will do I am using a brush a watercolor brush but if you don 't have watercolor brushes any paint brush will do I 'm using a bit of a thicker one just so that I can cover more surface area so you want to start with your lighter colors first so you 're going to make sure that you 've got your brush nice and wet with water and then I 'm going to grab this watercolor palette full of greens okay so you know you don 't have to do a green cactus if you don 't want to you can dabble into any color that you want I 'm just going to be using green for the purpose of this exercise so dabbling into my green getting that nice and loaded with paint and then you 're simply going to just go across the whole cactus just cover it all up and you can tell that some of the areas are picking up the black ink but that is totally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same effect that you want and it 's okay if you go over the lines like I said this doesn 't have to be perfect if anything going over the lines gives it a more authentic look once you 've covered your cactus with the green that you want you can dip into another color so I 'll dip into this lighter green here and then I 'll just start going over some sections that I want going over the top so you 're just smudging colors this is literally all we 're doing we 're just smudging colors dipping into water when we want smudging them a little bit more so that you can still see the very light green that we put down but you can also see the darker green that we 're now putting down okay then you can dip into another green so you can either go back in with the light green or you can go into it with a darker green I 'm going to use this dark green here and same thing I 'm going to repeat the process and just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and simple okay now while our base layer is drying as you can see we 've got some texture happening it 's looking great so now we 're going to move on to our pot alright so the pot can be any color that you would like you can do it brown you can do it blue you can do it red you can do it any color that you 'd like I 'm going to go into the pink so I 'm going to grab my ray of oranges in pink color this looks like a red but it 's definitely a pink so I 'm going to dip my brush into that color same brush as before like I said if you 've only got one paintbrush that is totally fine especially for these exercises so you 're going to layer on the color on the side like so just small brush strokes on the side so you really want most of the color to be on this side over here once you 're happy with your color distribution and just dip the pen brush into the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're going to smudge it out just smudge it out so that when you get to this side over here there 's less color and what you 've just done is you 've created dimension to the pot okay and once it 's dry we can add a little bit more color on this side here so that way you 've got even more dimension now what I forgot to mention is with your pot just draw an extra line over here so that it is the outline of the pot like so and that will make that a darker red to create the outline and what 's going around the pot and then inside the pot you 're going to grab some Brown to create the soil in my greens I also happen to have a brown so I 'm gonna dip my brush into here again same brush that I 've been using since the beginning and I just disperse that across this area here okay making sure not to touch the red as it is quite wet and I don 't want it smudging into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is totally fine because that is creating more dimension we 're just going to let that dry and then we 'll be back in a minute it 's a little bit drier we 're going to use a thin brush and we are going to color in the line that we 've created here to make it a little bit darker and a little bit more dimension so you so we can go back in with our green and we just color it in some more where we want a lighter green and more pigment okay dipping into another color just blend those colors together now I 'm going to leave my cactus like this because I 'm quite happy with it so then our pot here is a little bit drier so what you can do you can go in with some more of that pink shade just make a little bit more predominant you and you 're done that 's it that was so simple you 're done you 've got a beautiful little cactus once it 's dry I 'll show you what it looks like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is what it could look like once you put it in a frame I didn 't have any spare trims to put this one in so this is what it would look like in a frame you can put it up on your wall or just prop it up against the wall it 's up to you I hope you enjoyed this video and I will see you next time"

give your listeners something to come back to and keep them engaged for the next episode so if that 's a fiction podcast you might end on a cliffhanger or you might end your episode with a few questions or tease what 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other sounds your audience will hear whether that 's other guests interviews soundscapes atmosphere sound effects and music you 'll also need to consider what interviews or guests you want to add to your program especially if it 's a talkspace podcast we 'll talk a bit more about this in our next session most importantly with all these elements going on you 're going to need a strong plan and a clear run sheet there 's so much to remember so keep track of it on a run sheet so let 's recap you 'll need to structure your episode with one topic for the best result and if it 's a fiction based podcast you 'll need a clear beginning middle and end just like you would if you were writing a story just like chapters in a book the umbrella theme is the same and each chapter is a related topic with a more specific focus knowing that we have one topic per episode we need to make certain considerations to ensure that our podcast hits the mark first of all we need to think about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and what voices are we going to be hearing there are so many different styles and genres and ways that you can do this but just pick one that suits you what what is it exactly that you 're going to be exploring in your podcast remember we need to be really specific if you have a co-host what are they going to share if you decide to invite a guest what can they bring to the table you also need to think about why why have you chosen this topic and the people that you brought on board why are they the right candidate when we 're also thinking about why we consider our listeners why should our listener care knowing your motivations for the episodes your podcast will help direct this question and finally when when your listener finishes listening to your podcast what impact do you wish to have on them it 's always good to set goals so let 's talk a little bit about interview guests first of all consider who they are are they a professional can they offer personal insight and experience or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a personality that makes the podcast a bit more engaging uh in another way they might be shy and a bit more reserved and you might need to put in a bit more effort to tease out the conversation but most importantly think about what impact your guest will have on your podcast just by who they are consider why you 're interviewing them that gets back to personal experience or anecdotes they might be able to share or they might be an expert on an issue which is really common also consider the timeliness of when you choose to conduct your interview is it in the morning is it in the evening maybe when everyone 's tired and had a long day try and work out a time that works best for you and your guests but also research research research it 's really important that you 're familiar with the guests that you will be interviewing the more familiar you are with them the easier the conversation and flow of the interview will be it 's always best to speak to the person who you were interviewing way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it but then also have a little bit of a chat and get to know each other get familiar confirm your interview either through a text message or an email it 's always best that everyone knows what time of day it 's happening and when if you 're working with a co-host make sure that they are also aware of what the interview is going to be about and who you 're interviewing maybe dedicate certain questions to certain co-hosts think about your audience as well how is the audience going to receive this interview [Music] so let 's take a closer look at some of these podcast production roles first of all presenters that role probably comes immediately to mind because it 's likely the first voice we 'll hear in the podcast if you 're the presenter or also called the host you have a big role in determining the tone the mood and the style of the piece so think about how you can use your voice to emphasize words and think about what sort of mood you want to create for the listener second of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ role in fiction or story based telling podcasts you might need to relay important bits of information to the listener as the episode goes along and if it 's a non-fiction style podcast you can work as a bridge between interviews third of all script writer now the scriptwriter would not be writing the script word for word it 's not an essay or a speech and it 's quite conversational you might like to script very closely the introduction and outro to set the context and relay important information at the book ends of your episode otherwise the scriptwriter would be detailing what important points need to be hit in each segment finally the researcher this is one production role that involves digging in deep to where you can find out all the information and setting the context for your episode there are many ways you can research obviously the internet is a big source but you might also con conduct some more informal research reaching out to stakeholders and people impacted by the issue you might like to conduct some vox pops that 's voice of the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go out onto the street to get public opinion but you could also ask people to inbox you or send little email snippets of their opinion on an issue the audio technician operator makes sure that all the gear that 's involved is working and recording properly they may also set up the space so that there are no recording hazards and that it is user friendly they would also operate any microphones or recording devices that have been used and making sure that the levels are all good on their audio we don 't want any peeking they want to make sure that everyone 's sounding their best sourcing sound effects can be a job shared between the audio technician operator and editor and these sounds can be used to enhance your conversation or storytelling in your episode the editor the editor does work post-production firstly they consolidate all of the audio files that you 've recorded and any sounds that you want to use using a digital audio workstation the editor takes these recordings and edits them so that the end product is clean and professional the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to be structured and what 's going to be included they can be layering sounds adding any music jingles this can be free to use or sounds that they 've created themselves and adjust the levels on or any audio and removing any unwanted sounds remember one person can perform multiple roles or these roles can be given out to individual team members how long should your podcast be the length of podcasts vary it 's like asking how long a piece of string is podcast episodes can vary from 15 minutes to an hour it depends on the topics that you 'll be delving into in each episode it 's also important to keep in mind the attention span of listeners you want to make sure that you 're clear and catchy and to consider what is really important and necessary in each episode a run sheet helps you do this your run sheet is an essential part of planning your podcast and bringing all of the elements together it will help you structure your episodes and your run sheet is a success if any producer can read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a detailed production plan that lays out what each team member will be doing what their roles are the timing of the recording or how long each segment is going to be the list of equipment that 's going to be used and any notes on the segments that you 'll be discussing here we have an example of a basic podcast episode run sheet so we can see that we have an intro our segments segways and outro a segue can either be the narrator or music it 's completely up to you then in our following column we have who roles here we would lay out what each team member 's production role is whether you be the presenter the audio technician editor or researcher then we have notes and talking points so any points that we want to make sure that we hit in each of our segments we would write these down here so that the team is across it all then we have equipment and audio sources this can be anything from any digital audio workstations you might be recording into any devices that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this tells us how long we would like each segment to be which could be between three to five minutes or longer in our upcoming isolation creation videos we 'll be taking you through how to record from home and how to source sounds online thanks for tuning in today [Music] you"

    "text": "[Music] hi I 'm Rebecca from skin media and we provide broadcast opportunities and media training for young Australians all our content is made by young people for young people thanks Tamara but on council for inviting us to share an isolation creation basics from creating an initial idea of picking a topic to what you need to record and to produce your podcast in today 's isolation creation the said media learning team will be taking you through how to pick a topic for your podcast so let 's talk about the basics but simply a podcast is audio based so we 're not talking about vloggers or YouTube anything net to be able to be streamed and downloaded and unlike radio the listener has the ability to pause rewind or skip ahead you can think of the podcast being a bit like chapters of a book so each episode might cover a certain theme or topic under a broader theme the really cool thing about podcasts is you can cover refined niche really specific topics so you 'll be able to see many weird and wonderful podcasts out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a medium to be able to tell stories hear different points of view learn about interests and hobbies you can transfer listeners to other worlds you can debunk complex topics talk about personal experiences and share world views podcasts fit into styles and genres you might not have worked that out yet and that 's okay but just like film and TV picking the genre may make it easier for you to plan podcasts fit into many different styles and genres and fall under many different themes themes like pop culture song exploder is a podcast where musicians take apart their songs and piece by piece tell the story of how they were made society and culture mostly lit exploring the intersection between literature wellness and pop culture pretty for an Aboriginal our conversations about relationships dating power and race storytelling all the best is a podcast that showcases Australian storytelling by young radio makers through documentaries interviews personal narratives and fiction another example is this American Life which contents varies by episode stories are told as first-person narratives and the tone ranges from thought-provoking to humorous there are so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world and these are just a few examples so go out and explore and look at all those genres from advice to debating discussion informative Fox pops games and quizzes there are so many different styles and tones that you can consider when putting together your podcast it 's always best to choose a genre or style that you are comfortable with or that you feel is going to convey your story the best why listen I 'll make a podcast not only a podcast greatly entertaining but also highly edge occasional podcasts provide insight into the world that we live in through conversation and storytelling the beauty of podcast 2 is that they vary greatly with so many different mesh topics podcasts also extremely easy to access whether you 're on the go doing exercise doing your chores or even just lounging around at home one of the most motivating factors for creating podcasts is that you could be the first to make a podcast about the chosen topic that you 're passionate about you get to share your views your passions interests with people all around the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk about some of the qualities of a good podcast you might have an idea where Eddie but you also might need to spend some time brainstorming what your interests and hobbies are when picking a topic think what do you want the world to know more or maybe there 's an issue you don 't see discussed elsewhere in the media it 's important to pick a topic that you 're really interested in the more engaged and well researched you are on a topic the more engaged your listeners will be you might not know everything about your topic to begin with and that 's okay just be open to asking questions and digging deeper with research we 'll have more tips on this in our later videos some other things to consider are having a clear catchy title you might want to do a play on words just make sure it doesn 't exist already so it 's easily searchable think about your intended audience and be really specific go deeper than just their age gender and location you can get really specific and podcasts overall your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sound like a robot and you want to keep it conversational so don 't feel like you need to script your vodcast word-for-word [Music] now that you know what makes a good podcast and that your podcast could be anything from sharing work views telling stories transporting your listeners to other worlds debunking complex topics or simply talking about your interests and hobbies what 's next podcasts are a series of episodes so each episode should be specifically looking at something to do with your overall topic you want to make sure that you had a clear beginning middle and end you want to tie up any loose ends and you want your listener to be able to follow through clearly you can think of it like a book your book is your podcast and each chapter within that book are your episodes you want to be specifically focusing on something that you 've chosen to talk about overall when picking a podcast topic you want to make sure that you 're informed and passionate think about what your listener is going to get out of listening to your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ react to your topic there are also so many styles and genres of podcast to choose from but you want to make sure that the style or genre the new pick is something that you 're comfortable with and will convey the message that you 're going to be discussing keep an eye out for the videos that we have coming up isolation creation next up we 'll be talking about how to plan your podcast production we 'll also go over recording remotely and how to set up a DIY studio from home and how to soul sound and some editing tips

    "text": "hi I 'm Sam it 's nice to meet you we just came from the last video in that case it 's nice to see you again we just need some cool embroidery I 'd love to do something with it with you first said I 'd like to acknowledge the traditional owners of the land which I live and work on the war injury waiver run and borrowing peoples of the Kulin nation I want to pay my respects the elders past present and emerging and to acknowledge that this land was never seated I 'm gonna wash my hands we can get stricken just a Content warning for anyone who finds hand wash me a bit triggering right now I 'll skip ahead about five seconds I have a quick announcement to make just come to my attention that my measuring tape is 1.5 meters long just perfect for measuring social distancing so it come to my attention that Griffin 's lead there 's also exactly 1.5 meters on do you want to go for a social distancing walk cool we 've actually already done the embroidery in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have something like an embroidery or painting or something on face to fabric and you want to make that fabric into a fabric hanging let 's do that so the first step is just to iron it yeah just making sure that you keep the iron moving because if you keep it in one spot too long you 're more likely and if it is your first time using an iron it can be worth getting somebody to show you or just like watch as you do it to check your check your technique the first time I use mine I 've burned the absolute mercy out of the thing that I was shining so it 's definitely worth like having an extra pair of eyes if you 've got some cool welcome to my desk a few things that you may want to hand for this project something to hang your hanging from I have a stick something to hang I have an embroidery measuring tape pins and a pencil to help measure and mark things need thread for sewing things scissors for cutting said thread you 're hanging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thread of some kind I have some crochet yarn but you can use whatever you have tend and I want to make some castles and I 'm going to do that with some embroidery thread optional extra a sewing machine it is not necessary but if you feel comfortable or you want to learn how to use a sewing machine you can make the process it slightly quicker also good to have an iron obviously this one is turned off if you don 't have an ironing board you can very tower down on a flat surface and iron on that instead so to begin with I want to figure out how wide I want this hanging to be I usually do this by eye to begin with because every embroidery is different so I 'm just folding the edges underneath to work out how wide I want this one to be that looks pretty good to me let me show you so miking this with the next task is to start measuring along so this is twenty point five centimeters here twenty point five ish here wait a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll bring that in I 'm just making sure it 's all the same width and then I am marking that out with pins because pins can be seen from both sides of the fabric up here it 's just bit over just going to roll it in a little bit right on I 'm just going to measure and mark right along the length of the fabric it can be quite important to measure it with whatever you 're hanging it from just to make sure that the width feels good for the for whatever you 're hanging it off quite like that I think if it had been any wider it would have covered up a lot of the stick we wouldn 't see these cool interesting knobbly bits on the end so I feel like this which actually works really really well you do want a bit of space between the embroidery and stick um just give that a bit of space to breathe as well it 's all about your taste and what you like the most so do whatever you like with it we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is going to have the rod or the stick you don 't want to sew all the way to the top because then you won 't be able to get the stick in I just want to mark it on the top layer if you sew right up close you can 't get this weird crease but if you saw it a little bit further down I get a very even shape got a market these same places on the back you can feel the pin on this side I 'm just gonna match up pin on this side just being careful to grab only one layer then again over here here 's the pin on this side I 've got my finger on it so I can for you to where i want to pin on this side to be very careful not to stab yourself in this process you just want to check that the space between these two which is almost 12 centimeters it 's close to the space between these two which is again almost 12 centimeters so I 'm pretty happy with that we want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got all these pins because you can see them from both sides you want to line up these pins that mark where we want to stop sewing I 'll line them up with each other so I can feel the pin on this side I can feel the pin on this side I don 't know if you can see but I 'm holding them together so I know they 're in the same spot I 'm going to pin through both I 'm gonna do the same over here and I 'm just going to open this out so I can see the pins and line them up all the way down like this I 'm gonna pin those sides together lovely just go pin that with my very very wonky pin this particular pin had an altercation with a sewing machine all right well it 's mark out with pencil where we 're gonna sew so I don 't actually earn a ruler I tend to use whatever I have to hand which in this scenario is indeed a chocolate box and I 'm lining up with this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're gonna do is saw it tried to film the hand sewing part I wanted to show you but it was really dark so you couldn 't see it very well and I explained myself very poorly so instead I 'm gonna show you what it looks like and then I 'm gonna show you how I did it so it doesn 't look super neat unfortunately but hopefully it will look neat enough from the inside I am going to do one side hand-sewn one side from Shane so we can see if there are any differences hopefully my hand sewing is neat enough that there won 't be that much difference there are many ways to then sew a seam I 'm going to show you a couple of my favorite ways the first thing I guess to note is not to grab too much thread probably not longer than your arms are because it starts to get a bit unwieldy and tie itself in knots as we pull it through we 're gonna use this thread doubled up to give it a bit more strength so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them together it 's a running stitch so you want to be legal in when you needle that you needle in bring your needle out you 're basically just going in and out and in and out in and out it 's nothing wrong with a good simple seam it 's pretty strong it 's like this when you open it up the next method the way that I used to sew the seam down the side of the hanging so I 'm just putting my needle in and bringing it up just start us off and then instead of going forward I 'm just going in and out and in and out I 'm gonna go back about half a stitch then come out just on the other side of where the thread is coming through and I 'm going to do it again so I 'm going to back off a stitch come out just on the other side of where the threads coming through so you 're kind of doubling back on yourself the whole way down you all right there it is so it 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ row of stitches along the top and almost a double row along the bottom where it 's they 've all overlapped and loop to both it back over themselves when you open it up you can see that there 's just heaps of little stitches holding it together there so the fabric is held quite closely together it ends up being quite a strong stitch this is no sewing machine I 'm not going to show you how to thread it or how to use it because every machine is different I 'm gonna start so I at the top here where we left out with the pins that we 're going to start throwing in I 'm just gonna sew down the line that we marked out into the fabric runs out it is important just before I start that I reposition these pins not a great idea to try and sew over the top of a pinhead if you do that 's what happens so repositioned all of the pins to be facing this way because then the so I needle can just skip over the top of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just guiding it to make sure that the line stays in the right spot as a side note keep your fingers away from the needle I have sewn through my finger with a sewing machine before and it really hurts I could have been much worse so pay attention to like where your fingers up protip um so I 'm just gonna go ahead and take all of these pins out because we don 't need them anymore excited to turn it out and see what we 've got before we turn it back inside out let 's just trim up the seam allowances so I 'm just gonna cut it and we believe still update I 've seen here but not this much I think I 'll leave about that much things but when I 'm getting at me to the top I actually do want more seam allowance up here so right near the top I 'm just gonna take a bit of an angle here that much seam allowance the reason I want some more stable outs at the top it 's because we 're not actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fold it and it 'll just sit on a nice folded edge with this raw edge on the inside and the more material there is to fold away the less likely it is that this raw edge is just going to pop out and unfold itself so it looks like something all right so into that well let 's turn it right-side out I love this bit have a look at those things looks pretty good this is one seam is the other same I 'm very proud to note that they don 't look that much different I actually just have to double check which is which here 's the machine sewn seam it 's the hand sewn seen both equally flat both look good so yeah you can do it by hand is quicker by Machine both are gonna be fine the inside seam is actually just in there hanging out but it 's far enough in that it 's not going to slide out I 'm so excited about this so obviously because the stick is wonky and now hanging is straight it 's going to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dowel I 'll show you actually the hang would hang very straight but I kind of really like the I rod with a bit of character camera for a minute so I can fit this all in frame the next thing we want to figure out is where we want this hanging to end I just want to start this off by doing it by eye I 'm pretty happy with this I myself just want to catch one layer but you don 't need all of this so I 'm gonna leave that do you smudge so just go start at the front you and then I just want to make sure it 's even pretty happy with that so you see seems just turned inward so I often put a little bit of fringing along the bottom of my hangs because you 're probably going to attach the fringing along the bottom here you can just run a straight seam across the bottom because it 'll be hidden by the way you attach the fringing but it looks so lovely without any seams on it I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stitch along the insides I 'm going to hide where I put my not going to put the nail in in here and then bring the needle out right up close to the edge of these of the see pick up just the inside layer on that side so it 's not showing through here but I 'm picking it up here then I want to do that same thing on the other side so I just want to pick up one layer I 'm up to the last stitch here and we just want to hide the last stitch inside I open this up to the inside of this material here it 's like we 've been doing a little long so we just aren 't catching either of the outside edges and we 'll pull it through but not all the way through I want to leave this loop and then I want to pass the needle through the loop but I 'm holding on to the next loop to pull that first one tight I 'm just going to do that once more so passing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loop pull that tight so now just got a bit of a bit of thread coming out of what looks like nowhere which is pretty cool but to get rid of that I 'm just going to stick the needle through to somewhere else in the piece somewhere inconspicuous like another scene pull it through so I 'm just going to cut this bit of thread here that looks good yeah almost done I 'll sort of we 've got a few more tasks to do so one of the things we want to do is make our work to go up here I just want to iron it flat then I want to make some cute little tassels to hang on the bottom just taking this out because we 're gonna iron it soon but I want to show you how I work out how long I want this work to be and the answer is I just eyeball it some things about that like I 'm going to take this bit of yarn measured I want approximately eighty to eighty one centimeters I know for this particular route @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of like knotting it up to make eighty centimeters of plaited rope out of this particular yarn I 'm going to need 88 to 90 centimeters this yarn to start with when you 're planning something it really does help if you can secure it to something you can 't always leave a little bit more yarn at the top here and just tie it to something we 're gonna add it you just want to be careful to iron all of this bit but not the top bit because you don 't want to put a crease on that incited this thing I into this let 's put it all together it 's going to divide it in half so that I can find the midpoint and I want to make sure that that stays about there it looks pretty good to me I wrapped it around leaning this lace check this three watts wind it around tuck it through again and then pull the whole thing tight let 's go this cute little tag taggi bit you can tuck this tag in um I usually put a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a black fringing along this one I think that would look really cool in terms of the seams you just can 't really tell the difference between the one that was machined er the one that stands stitched now they 're they 're pressed so that 's pretty cool you welcome to follow today there but I 'm gonna make some tassels tassels are delightfully easy to make I want to make some short tassels I 'm just gonna start everything this string around my fingers the more times you wrap it around the thicker your tassels going to be I wrapped this string around my fingers 13 times I 'm only noting that because I want to make a few tassels that are the same size just cut a little length of embroidery thread we 're gonna pass it through and pull it to the top I 'm just gonna tie it cool that 's holding that nicely in place I 'm gonna use this is to cut over the bun there is an extra step I like to do I think makes it nice and cute and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see in shops wrap a little bit of the same thread around a couple centimeters from the top I 'm going to tie this off at the back I 'm just pulling that firmly download trim off the we had strugglers at the end okay there 's that I love tehsils I 'm gonna make a few more it 's so cute just started marking out where I want them to go I think black will go in the middle because there 's only one of those so the way that I 'm going to attach these with an embroidery needle it 's going to snip that 's like a nice even end I want them to look like they 're coming out of the bottom so I 'm going to go in between the seam here and I want to tie them off at the back just deciding whether I want them to have a little bit of hang or whether I want them to sit right up against it against the fabric for the length of this piece it 'll look cool if they 've could hang now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've just tied a little knot just can put my needle back through the fabric so I don 't have kind of like a dagger end bit then if I pull this a little bit kind of scrunch up the fabric a bit and cut it close to the fabric it 's just going to disappear back into the fabric when I cut it I 'm gonna do that small more times I 'm so excited about it how you feeling excited and inspired to have a grow this yourself and I wish you the best of luck in your creative endeavors I hope that you get something good out of this video too good luck"

so buncher is an African recipe that talks about you are what you are because of everything else so you don 't exist in isolation you exist in in in environments that informs you so everything else informs you so I love that that 's that 's a philosophy that drives the Equality of always I think something that inspired me to study law was to kind of go back home and make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sudan is something that really needs to needs to be worked on so if I were to change something or make an impact upon something you definitely the quality for my energy do I buy yeah for sure my vibe everybody says that I 'm always happy or I 'm always smiling or I 'm just like a bubbly person and I guess that that always makes a difference on somebody but are you having like an extremely bad day and I guess just seeing you smile it makes their day Tuesday yeah like people to remember me by it has an individual that was so human I don 't know how that say no human I want to be remembered as a unit tested that connected with humanity you"

    "text": "hello my name is Sam it 's nice to meet you look what 's doing some embroidery with you today um first I want to acknowledge the traditional owners of the land which I live and work on who are the Wurundjeri way around and butter on peoples of the Kulin nation I pay my respects to the elders past present and emerging and acknowledge that this land was never seated on that note let 's get our hands washed and get into it but first we 're in my messy bathroom because it 's important to wash your hands between activities even at home so for this you need an air drawing something doctor trace over it with a pencil some sticky tape some fabric and embroidery hoop and for a needle and some embroidery fit so I realized that my measuring tape is exactly at 1.5 meters long which makes it perfect measuring social distancing perfect additionally it can be good to have scissors because when you have thread you do need to cut it and an iron let 's do some embroidery I have drawn a template @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done it in pencil so far Cup have a look it looks like this so far I just want to show you guys this I 'm very proud of myself I don 't have equipment but I 'm making it work all right let 's get into it you so second to the windows so that we can trace with the light behind it 's kind of like a light box but you don 't have to buy that you do have to wait for this one to be out so I 'm just going to take my fabric to the window basically over the top so you can see through it and then I 'll trace isn 't my piece of fabric I 'm using brown because that 's what make that also would look great with colors anyway before you start your embroidery it 's important to figure out how large your piece of fabric needs to be to do that you need to know what you want to do with it so I want to make a hanging out of this one to do that I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece plus a little bit on the edges either side for seam allowance and I want it to be as long as my face plus enough at the top that I can work out the hanging and enough at the bottom that I can trim it to whatever size I think looks good at the time because I 'm making it into a hanging I want to do the embroidery on what will end up being the front so if you imagine this like a rom through the top there I want my embroidery to be here which actually means I want to do it on the bottom of this piece of fabric all right it 's a bit tricky on darker fabrics but you can 't actually see the outline so I 'm gonna go ahead and trace it so are a few options as to what you want to use when you 're tracing it my go-to is a pencil it 's very simple it works washes off the only time I don 't use it is if this fabric is too dark for me to see it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just like draw on the fabric and then you heat it up with an iron and the marker disappears so that 's pretty cool one good option for darker fabrics is tailors chalk which usually comes in with little palettes like this but you can also get just various other things this is my favorite at the moment it 's just like a crayon version of tailors chalk and you just wind it up and it 's great on dark fabrics and it just wash yourself use whatever you can whatever you have access to and whatever is gonna work if you don 't have weird fancy crayons and tailors chalk and stuff just be a bit careful to pick a line of fabric that you can see a pencil on and they 're good to go you so I did use pencil there 's a bit dark that you can see it so now I 'm gonna pop out traced fabric onto an embroidery hoop just unscrew the top pop out the middle middle goes back [Music] yeah the bit goes over the top screw it tight again so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fabric tight you don 't have to fit the whole drawing into the embroidery here if you can sew it piece by piece so you don 't have to have a massive embroidery hoop to do massive embroidery so you just want to grab some thread to get started with I wouldn 't grab too much more than that because it starts to get unwieldy just to not at the other end you 're just gonna stab it in through the back cool [Music] so that 's all I wanted to do with that colored thread in that spot so I just kind of flipped over and tie it off so usually just tie it to whatever is closest to it I tend not to pull too tight because that 'll wrinkle up the fabric when you take it off the stretcher so I thrown it under there now I 've made a loop put this through the loop now I have another loop so I 'm just pulling that first loop tight and then I 'm just going to put this through the loop one more time holding on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first one tie it again then just hold it down with my finger so it 's nice and flat and pull it all the way through that should be try not to cut too close to the knot because sometimes you can just undo if you cut it really really close but yeah that 's nice and secure and pretty and done I 'm just gonna repeat that for the black through I don 't actually have to go that far between this piece and the police they want to avoid annexed and that will be true for all of the black bits because they 're all pretty closer together so I 'm just gonna pull the thread behind and go down to the next bit anyway I 'm just gonna keep going like this I 've done all of the black spots then again I am sorry for the cat noises just they just they live here too you know um so I have finished up all the black stitching that I can reach this with the hoop in this place I 'm gonna do some yellow stitching down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knot in the end just going to pass it through I 'm just following the line that we traced you just want to bring this back to close that gap so this is the way I do this stitch I do one stitch forward one stitch back very good nice even line hello just trying to keep my stitches the same size go to the end of what I can do with the hoop in this spot so I 'm just gonna move it I 'm screwed at the top the circle bit down I 've got a bit of writing here so I want to get that in just pop it back over the top up again banana is complete let 's do some words when I embroider words I tend to find that just this embroidery strand as it is is too thick or it 's very thick and the word ends up a bit bubbly but if you focus good if you actually have a look at embroidery strands embroidery thread they 're made up of about six strands I like to use three or four four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for embroidering words so I 'm just going to take two off the strand just doing that by pulling at the end of it I have some embroidery thread which is only full strand slide so I don 't have any tricks to embroider in words sometimes I feel like I 've just got the rights to the right number of stitches in the right place to really make the letters look natural and handwritten and sometimes I just mess it up um the cool thing about embroidery is that it 's so forgiving like you can just unpick it and do it again as you can see I didn 't super like the first way I did this be curved letters are very tricky sometimes so I 've just cut the stitch I can just we go out the threat again you that looks better you right looks pretty legible to me I 'm happy with these shapes if I wasn 't I could just redo any of them but I am so I 'm gonna tie it off cool so there 's another one I 'm working on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised off the surface I 'll show you how I do that one so you have my string I 'm going to wrap it around my needle put my needle into the fabric and it 's very important that I keep tension on this string otherwise it 's just going to like unravel then very slowly I just pull this thread through like once much neater little strange bubble thing it 's a variation on a French knot if you want to look it up elsewhere so I 'm gonna go ahead and do the stem in a chain stitch which is a cool stitch that also that 's a bit of texture so I want to bring the needle up through where I want the stitch to start me is at the bottom then I want to put the needle back through that same hole but it will hold on to the thread so I end up with a little loop then I want to bring the needle up where out the next stitch just start and I want to put the loop over it and pull the thread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from then I want to do the same thing so I 'm going to put the needle back through that same through the same hole that just came through I want to hold onto the thread so I end up with a loop put the needle three where I want the next stitch to stop put the loop over it and pull it up and then you 've done that a few times start ending up with a little chain of stitches so I 'm gonna go ahead and finish that off you when I show you what happens if I pull down round rather than up so made my little loop put my needle through it I have been pulling up this direction but if I pull back you 'll see that the loop tightens into like a much smaller the loose than we want and if you pull that that way now again I 'm just going to make the fabrics fabric stretch in really weird ways it 's going to be really really scrunched there it was really easy to fix if you do that by accident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loop up a little bit I 'm gonna put my needle through it and then just pull it out a bit so now you can see it 's nice and loose again and then I 'm just going to pull up sorted this last stitch you don 't want to go back through this hole because then this the loop that 's resting on it 's going to come undone to finish off I 'm just going to put the nail in over the top this last loop how 'd that loot last loop down ready to iron so we should keep the iron moving if you leave it in one spot uh I 've discovered that you can burn the material also make sure it 's set to the appropriate material I 'm also going to iron it from the back you don 't feel super confident with an iron see if there 's something around you don 't feel confident tonight the first time I used to know I really really burnt into a siding so here 's what getting something to show you how to use your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it looks really cute I 'm really excited about it thank you like congratulations you made it big I hope you enjoyed this process I hope you feeling like excited about doing something creative you can get brighter on anything I think is fabric basically um like clothes or bags or tea towels or like curtains whatever you want um stretchy fabrics are gonna be a little bit trickier to embroider on but not impossible I hope you have fun with it everybody these are both of my cats invading my desk while I 'm trying to film are very helpful"

    "text": "hmm we 're up to video 500 series oh boy oh boy yep video well no time has passed since the last video what are you talking about I 'm sure in this video we 're gonna be talking about oh how did you put it relearning unlearning than learning yes okay so let me tell you what I meant by that okay so everything that we are right now is is again habits but everything that has been taught to us by our parents our teachers our friends and our surroundings so pretty much everything that we are is an accumulation of the things that we 've learnt and some of those things might not be right and some of those things might be right there might be serving you but everything that you are right now is is habits that you 've accumulated along the way so for us to drop this habit is we need to unlearn pretty much let 's just for the sake of you know for the sake of learning let 's unlearn everything that we 've learned let 's drop everything and just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new habits you gotta understand even the voices that you hear sometimes and not your own they 're voices of either your parents speaking it might come across as yours and this might be a bit too much and too much information or it might be too heavy subject but the voice is that like even the language that I 'm speaking right now it 's not my language it 's it 's an accumulation of films and movies and teachers and everything that have that I 've been taught by so it 's a day-by-day step it 's a baby step and it might take forever but that 's okay that 's not the point the point is to pretty much learn new tools that can help you love yourself that can help you understand yourself and help your psychology in the way you think so if you feel a bit overwhelmed by what Sammy said easily place the stock it 's a lot of wisdom it 's a lot of wisdom an easy place to start with that is just looking at right now right now you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that usually don 't sit with as in you 're around the people that you live with a whole lot more than usually would be yeah or if let 's say you 're introverted and you spend you like spending a lot of time at home on your own and all that well the other people that you live with and now home or you know but either way there 's something different you are being exposed to things more sit with it what is making you feel uncomfortable right now what is kind of stressing you out a little bit think about that because that shows you the first like that 's the first step that shows you where things can be different it shows you where your pain points are and that gives you a starting a starting place so from there like let 's say I realize that actually I 'm spending a lot of time with Sammy and he just really annoys me for some reason then I can see with them be like okay well why is he annoying me why do I feel that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is reminding me of someone else that I find really annoying is it because he 's showing me an aspect of myself that I don 't really like well I 'm like oh I 'm allowed to do that so you 're not allowed to do that you know or is it actually something completely different stop looking at the things that bother you and just ask more questions and work out okay what are my assumptions that I have about it and read the assumptions come from do I still believe in these assumptions or are they dated and we should move on and maybe replace it with other assumptions because your views always change and sometimes you 'll be surprised to find out that you 're holding on to views that just subconsciously you 're just like really through really small micro decisions you 're actually holding on to values that maybe you don 't keep anymore so it 's a really good way of doing housekeeping you know the other video is something spoke about cleaning think about this as cleaning all the the little things that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't actually represent you or your you 're they 're influencing you in a certain way where you actually don 't like showing up like that you know so I think that 's what that 's like a really simple easy way to start that unlearning process is working out okay how do I show up do I want to show up that way what beliefs do I need to have like what beliefs doesn 't mean that I have if I am showing up this way like what are the reasons for it and then thinking okay do I still have those beliefs do I agree with those beliefs knowing what I know now would I still choose those beliefs again and that 's where the magic happens way then you by being aware of it you 're doing the unlearning and then when you start questioning and working out do I still want this or do I want to replace this with something else that 's when the real learning happens and that 's the cycle like that 's always gonna keep on happening in life and just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because everything is so much in your face yeah cuz you 're in the same spot the whole time and understand that everything in this world is a point of view we all have points of view and not all of us perceive the world the same way as as like I don 't see the world the same way as she does and she doesn 't see it the same way as I do so I think like at the end of the day you just have to respect your point of view you don 't need to agree with someone else 's point of view but I think you also need to just like yeah understand that is your point of view yeah and I don 't need to agree with it but I do respect your point of view and that 's your point of view and that 's okay and my point of views my point of view multiple realities can exist at the same time because everyone working with in the constructor there in reality it is in your job to tell them what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually kind of subjective yeah so yeah so it 's a matter of looking at what is your truth yeah you want that to be your truth yeah how do you want it to be different yeah it is different truth is accepted and again truth is altered right truth changes from time to time from history to history from mouth to mouth from people to people but at the end of the day like she said you just gotta find your truth and and it 's your truth but that doesn 't mean it also has to be someone else 's truth and you don 't need to impose your truth upon anyone and someone doesn 't need to impose their truth upon upon you right so like everything that we 're saying right now is also it 's our point of view it 's out it 's how is what we 've learnt it 's what we accumulated and we 're sharing it with you but at the end of the day you take the tools that work for you and you make it work for you because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free makes everything if we say certain things and you want to cherry pick what works do that apply yourself yeah yeah because at the end of the day you are actually the person that has the most power you are you 're wearing lead on mm-hmm and this is a perfect opportunity to start working out well where are you leading yourself to and what kind of leader do you want to be for yourself there 's a great quote that I 'm trying to remember right now that I want to finish it off with that I 'm about leader it goes something like this and I might if I get it right I will I will post it if I don 't I 'll take this fight out but it goes something like this it goes don 't walk in front of me I may not follow don 't walk behind me I may not lead but walk beside me and we can find out together I got all right all right so that I just love that I just love that quote and yet be own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yeah and just like no no that at the end of the day you 've got this you 've got this you 've got this we believe in you you 've got this yeah and if there 's something that we said that really helped you put it in the comments below in quotes and and then hopefully others that reader will be inspired by it so you have a wonderful day enjoy this time to be with yourself and we 'll see you soon hopefully we make more videos of this and if you do enjoy this videos let us know so we can make more videos you guys have a wonderful time peace"

hoop we 're just tossing this plastic group at each other just trying to see like different ways we can catch it like by sticking your hand through am i catching it with like your foot or your head it was so dumb and I usually wouldn 't do that it was just so fun it 's just do things like that like grab something and just use it different you see what happens is by spontaneous these spontaneous just enjoy or just being in the moment everything has to be productive not everything has to have an end goal you know oh my god yes can you speak more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the world right now is that we can plan for any goals but really whether they actually happen or how that we get there is a different story so right now just have fun just enjoy the moment you 're here you 're alive you get

worry about the end result because it 's the end result that stresses us out and gets us all blocked and makes us feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to do it and then you judge yourself in the process because you 're like oh it 's taking too long it 's not looking as good as I wanted to look like if I just do things for the sake of doing them and if you 're doing it and you 're not enjoying it just put it aside and do the next thing and enjoy it yeah well even you could flip it around and do the things that you don 't usually enjoy and say okay how can I make myself enjoy it like if you don 't like cleaning put a podcast on yeah if you think about like the metaphor of just cleaning as well right the end result is obviously to clean the house but you 're not thinking about needing to clean the whole the whole house if you just start in one section and you just clean that bit and then you clean the next bit and the next bit and the next bit and oh you 're focusing on is that dirt right there needing to get rid of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs to move and then by the end you have a clean house but that 's a consequence all right success is a consequence anything that you do repetitively is the consequence even if it 's if it 's something positive you 're doing something great and you 're enjoying and loving yourself or you 're doing like self-love work the end result is more self-love right and by the end of it you love yourself and you don 't judge yourself don 't ever judge yourself just love yourself exactly the way you are because you are enough but if you catch yourself judging yourself you 're you 're able to observe it like look at it and realize okay I 'm judging myself that 's what my self speaking that 's like my ego when you observe that it doesn 't cut as deep it doesn 't get to you because you know that you are not it even though it 's the voice in your own head telling you that just know that that isn 't actually you yes so so yes so so yeah pretty much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learning and unlearning and relearning okay if you didn 't catch that it 's learning unlearning and relearning it or you can think of it as like I 'm learning the things that you 've learned to learn new things and new habits and new new things okay please see you on the next video you"

    "text": "[Music] my name is Lena and welcome to this little watercolor isolation I 'm going to be showing you today how to make some really beautiful watercolor prints that you can put up in your room or your house or you can just do it in a little watercolor book and it 's just a fun idea for you to do while you 're in isolation so that you don 't go stir-crazy just being inside also a really great time to channel your creative juices so that way you can channel all that pent-up energy that you have into something beautiful this is also a good reminder to remind you to practice social distance so while you 're doing that you can be doing your watercolor by yourself inside and it 's just a good downtime activity to do you can even do it in from the TV if you want that 's what I 've been doing at nighttime um also quick reminder wash your hands before and after the activity for a minimum of twenty seconds you know how it is alright and without further ado let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this video I 'm going to be showing you how to make some plants that are in different containers so different vases tea cups bottles kind of thing the first one is going to be a bottle and you 're going to need at least spaced out three different sections so the first one will be a bottle so just draw the bottle the bottle doesn 't have to be perfect I 'm not great at this just something like this okay next one will be a little pot so starting off at the base of my pot going down making it larger it 's like a little rectangle there you go and last but not least we 'll have a little tea cup so a little Bowl coming out like this and here you want to leave a gap in the middle so that your plant can come out of there little stand for the tea cup and then beautiful they go so you 've got your three objects and then from here your plants will come out okay so I 'm just gonna draw a line here so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darker there you go beautiful so now you 're ready to watercolor so that are your they are your three outlined pictures next you 're going to grab a smaller brush than previously preferably but I mean if you 've really got one brush like I said you make do with what you 've got okay so again starting with your lighter color and again we 're using green can you tell that I really like the color green so we 're going to use some green here and you 're going to press onto the paper upwards so press press press press press press press press press so you want to go upwards okay so just keep pressing down you hey once you 've laid down that color you can grab a darker shade of green and you start doing the same thing so we 're going to add dimension to our little plant situation that we 've got going on you and then you add another darker color so so far I 've used this color here and this color here now I 'm going to be using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm slowly running out and the same situation you just keep pressing down the color wherever you can we 're gonna let that dry a little bit so that way we can build up on the color that we 've already got while that 's drying we can still get started on the pots so for this you 're gonna need a Brown I 've decided to go Brown just because I found that it 's a nice color contrast and it goes well with the green so I 'm just using one single brown shade dip my brush into that quite heavily and it 's going to be the same situation as the cactus where we lay down the color on the side like so so that the dark side creates dimension so we can just keep going like this like that so we 're laying down quite a thick color on the side to then grab our brush clean gonna wipe it clean and with nothing on the brush we 're going to smudge it afterwards so just smudge up the lines outwards creating that dimension on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add some more color so then you just repeat the process for the other two pots you there you have it so they 're your three colors then I 'm gonna grab a small brush and I 'm just going to dip it into that brow and saturate it quite a bit into that color and then I 'm just going to do the tops of the bottle and the top of the jar like so to again create a little bit more dimension a little bit of a higher contrast and I 'm gonna repeat the same for the bottom of the teacup and they handle okay beautiful so we 're just gonna let that dry and then we 'll come back okay so our paint is a little bit drier now so we can keep adding the color very plain and very simple so just keep adding your color I 'm quite happy with that so I 'm just gonna leave it at this point I 'm just going to add a little bit of this brown here to create the depth of the cup around here but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that and there you have it so that one is completely is our finished artwork I 'd haven 't popped this one in a frame but like the other two twenties I gave you to pop it in a frame very easily and you 've got a beautiful drawing there you go I hope you enjoyed this video and I will see you next time bye"

been doing at nighttime um also quick reminder wash your hands before and after the activity for a minimum of twenty seconds you know how it is alright and without further ado let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this video I 'll be showing you how to create a beautiful sunflower picture that will brighten up any room because it 's bright and colorful and it 's got oranges and yellows and it 's super easy to do so first thing you 're going to do is you 're going to need a small piece of paper you can do this on a four a five a three like the size of the paper does really matter anyway you going to use the corner you 're going to start approximately maybe a third of the way down from the page and you 're going to start doing some Wiggles all the way down to form a quarter of a circle they 're done that 's the first step and that has already created a bit of your sunflower next you 're going to start putting the leaves of the sunflower so you want to start down at the bottom and you 're going to draw the first leaf pretty simple and then just keep adding on leaves like the previous one they don 't have to be perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've got your leaves around the circle you 're going to start adding them in between there you go so now you 've got a much fuller sunflower and you just keep going in between as you go some of them don 't have to touch so that creates a more rugged effect so they don 't all have to touch and there you go that 's basically the base of your sunflower done then with your pen you 're going to keep adding some fine lines so you can start from the bottom here and you just draw a wiggle so this is adding texture to the sunflower so you just add the natural movement of the petals boom there you go you 've got textured petals and then in this ledge you want to create some texture on the bulb of the flower alright so you 're going to draw little Wiggles like this like so and you 're going to do this all along the edge and you 're going to bring it down sometimes so you bring it down and then come back up have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be perfect you then you 're going to have some color to your sunflower so again we 're gonna start with the lighter color so I 'm going to grab my little orange yellow palette dip it into the color and start dispersing the paint across the petal you once you 've done that you 're going to dip your brush back into the water and you 're going to add some more water along each pedal and you 're going to dip into the orange so going to dip my brush into an orange color I 'm going to add that on the side like so and just add it as you please along the pedals wherever you want some more orange and the aim here is to start blending the yellow into the orange you now I 'm just going to wait for that to dry so that 's the base of my petals done and then I can add more color to it if I want later on with your bulb pretty self-explanatory it 's going to be a mixture of Browns and you 're going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more texture and to mimic these squiggles that we 've got going on here so I have an array of Browns you can play around with the depth of the color but I 'm going to use this dark brown here and I 'm just going to start layering on the paint like so just doing some squiggle motions if the Brown leads into the leaves that is also fine you there you go so you 've got your base layer on I might dip into a different kind of brown I might dip into this brown here that I 've got and add that on and you just want to keep layering on the colors with this same as with the petals just layer on the colors for the bulb and it doesn 't have to be perfect I 'm just gonna let that dry and I 'll be back in a minute so what we 're going to do now is we 're going to add color to where we want so that our sunflower doesn 't look so pale and then once you 've done that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have it you 've completed your sunflower beautiful and I 'll show you what it looks like when it 's dry all right here is our finished sunflower it 's looking beautiful this one is a little bit more yellow than the one I 've got in my frame but if you 've got a friend you can just pop this one in there and here 's what I 've done and again you can pop it up on a wall like these ones or you can just leave it black it 's up to you I hope you enjoyed this video and I will see you next time"

    "text": "to me I think of community development as like a matchmaker so it 's not about doing things for people it 's about sort of looking at a picture and making some assessments and just making connections for people so there 's no sense of me doing the work or doing things for people just actually you know giving people skills and confidence to make changes and to do what they want for their communities we live in Vietnam we always when they wrap and they um they always say the center business center so when we come here my sister say this one is very inclusive very good location our people and more busier and I have the good family who helped me to the business this one started for nothing we didn 't know anything but we have to learn with my friend my family happy to do this said only one is eight soon after that we became part of an affinities community where they have people to help you already becoming a foster carer or supporting young people in out-of-home care in that sort of way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can 't just sit back and think of someone should do that or someone really should do those sort of things or they need more people to help with this people should do that if I 'm not prepared to do it myself how can I ask others and how can I expect any change The Voice of America it 's just way a few members of the community come together and just kind of voice an opinion just into being through the leaders students that are doing real well or like who I aspiring to be something like sometimes the staff was sick that no one can work and only know one or two people here and I have to give the Marines they are completely hand even with my mom since you can have to help me as well even with my sister law my brother law still come to give me a head that I 'm so happy with that so lucky my mother and I we like to do a lot of stuff together and she 's also the person I go to for advice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you would ever like what today because she obviously experienced a lot coming from the war-torn country going here you become to know other people that have the same experiences online sa family members so go it kind of goes a long way and like there 's heaps of stuff in the community where like it brings people together we 're certainly not Trailblazers but again to me it becomes about community there 's a lot of different experiences types of people ages relationship dynamics and norms within a community and we want to contribute and reflect that as well in you know our role in supporting kids in out-of-home care it 's a very serious and a very important thing to do but you do it in such a fun way that 's about creating experiences about having fun it 's use all my dad 's dad jokes I get all the eye rolls but I you know like it so much out of it too and sometimes I feel like I 'm getting more than I 'm giving just because I 'm filing it 's such a positive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you forget about those really quickly some peeps I get abroad gotta Williamstown or somehow wouldn 't leave the area I can come down here and do my work from an office that 's located in the middle of my village shopping center so it 's not the sort of place anymore where you have to go into the office every day and be there to get your work done it 's much more flexible than that I 've worked in this division which is maribyrnong hobsons bay and Windham for the last 22 years since 2012 I 've been to Family Violence advisor here 's a little bit taken aback you know when I joined the police academy at 18 and I was a part of four squads of 100 people and those four girls and initially yeah it was a little bit intimidating I probably didn 't really have the worries of the world back then and I just sort of went with it we used to live in quite a busy road in quite a busy suburb and we thought we needed to live somewhere that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city and close to amenities and we looked at houses and there were new houses and we thought all let 's buy into here so my role is Metro access project officer basically I work with the community to make sure that the community General is accessible to people with disabilities so I could be working with local businesses I could be working with community health centers I could be working with neighborhood houses or I could be working with individuals that are having problems accessing the community had I have said 20 years ago when I started working i 've been doing ABC TV in the mornings talking about city shaping and national issues i would have just laughed but when i look back at it now it sort of all fits together in australia sort of jigsaw puzzle e y and i think that 's one of the keys either let 's just said there 's a door that i liked the look of so I 've got to walk through and see what 's on the other side one phone call that I did receive this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a time we had a quite a long conversation probably about 15 20 minutes and she was quite quite anxious and quite upset and I was trying to let her know of the things that she could access in the community and groups and activities and things she basically was answering me like well how would you know she didn 't say that but I can tell from her tone of voice and in the end i said to her look I don 't normally tell people this but I have a disability myself so I know and I understand where you 're coming from and after I kind of explained that to her her attitude totally changed and she understood that I understood the barriers that she was facing so it was kind of a good a good moment for both of us you obviously there 's lots of young constables that are and senior class rules that are females if they need support within the job you know we 're there for them absolutely I 've been doing it for 30 years I 've raised a family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live in this area I 've developed relationships with the external stakeholders they see me as somebody that they can call and having new people in roles constantly can cause a bit of confusion hopefully I 've got a bit of skill you know hopefully I 've developed a bit of expertise over the years at the end of the day there needs to be female managers probably a couple of generations away conversations that we just don 't have anymore that so what 's it like being a woman on a board that won 't be an issue anymore because it will it will be the normal to have several men or we as females that are there need to show that of whether you wear jeans or a dress high heels or flats or whatever it is it 's okay to go in and to be yourself in these situations and that role modeling and getting more women there is incredibly important we 're all links in a chain no one person is going to get us all the way so Chippewas as much as you can and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women to come through like said it 's coming and we 're coming quickly so look at night it 's a special place for the custodians of the land here you 've got to two tribes but were under Ian were no wrong tribes you know so quiet it 's it just gives you that peace you just have this piece and a lot of our elders busy people and you know they 're being traumatized some of them have been part of the stolen generation so you know being able to come here and really relax and then tell their stories you didn 't do the art and just sit by the river and remember things I 'm free here to be an artist smaller or behave be an emerging artists and be part of an arts tribe that doesn 't judge in any way whether I make money or have a reputation or do the marketing right I am an artist I had a brain injury from a car accident when I was 29 and it like totally you know changed my life changed who I was changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of things and find out who I was and I remember really early on like what I could see was just really interesting and be going look at the color of that but the way that shape that building goes round the corner and so I started trying to learn to draw which I wasn 't very good at and because I 've never done it before but I was also trying to recover and live with this brain injury which involved on a fatigue and pain probably wasn 't until about seven or eight years after my accident that I really was able to start really focusing on being a visual artist the work that I did a brave look was part of reconciliation it was reconciliation it was a celebration and the work there was done by the art group the elders art group and they input but what they would like for reconciliation and we had people from all over Australia really part of that painting was like I said it was a peace offering to say here you know let 's do this together I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue stone by helping them and putting a layer recycle paper with flower glue there and surprisingly if that single layer of even newspaper glued on is tagged over the tagging paint does not penetrate so I 'd love to be able to paste up all over what 's great really i 'm not going to be able to do that I do occasionally get out there I was always part of us and that was when singing and dancing you know was always telling the story that you can tell on the painting so my art is about passing on knowledge passing on stories in the celebration of our collagen and Who I am as a person in a big part of me becoming an artist actually owes a great debt to marine which is the maribyrnong River Edge arts movement which used to have its studios on the banks of the Melbourne on river right near the foot square community art center and there 'd actually one of Mel burns oldest arts organization so there are just a group of Studios and they welcomed me in and encourage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then just meeting the like-minded group of people was it 's really important one of the ways that I manage my chronic pain and is to do handstands so I 've been doing hands down every day for 12 years and so I had this crazy ritual this crazy practice that I do and I thought will add fit it 's not about it I have fought all my life openly for equality and equity for women so and I don 't resolve from that and never will and we 've got a long way to go I think the new generation of women are wonderful so I have a daughter who 's in her 40s she absolutely accepts what I never even knew when I was in my twenties that women are there women can be there you know I 've just bugger off if you think anything else there are mixed messages for women and about women that really need to be sorted and I expect you as a new generation to do it you my brothers play for a local football team and I started off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ players that 's when I was allowed to play so I got to fill in and I was probably about eight years old when I was able to pull on jumper and actually get around run out and get a kick it was good fun when I was still living overseas I heard about the women sucks in Melbourne always liked doing things and using my body so I thought maybe and I was coming from my artistic background as well so it looked like a combination always liked ropes and tying knots as a kid and climbing the trees I was working in media started just doing boxing fitness classes and I was walking along the river was very sort of cinematic you know walking along the river on my way to work and just out of the corner of my eye saw this woman showing another woman had a box and it turned out that she was a world champion kickboxer plus a a competitive professional boxer it so sort of like I 'm actually it 's a possibility to do it when I started people were still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagine people saying should you know women be allowed to do something that 's kind of like was just incredible and the anxiety about breasts of you know concern about health and safety chivalry supposedly about protecting women was sort of overplayed so much I knew that it was different for girls to play those sports but I was pretty determined not to worry about it too much because I loved playing them it 's really great to see that young girls now have those opportunities that coming in to a community like this is just amazing it just became the circle of people you knew came just very quickly footscray is traditionally a very working-class area and boxing was a big part of that love the culture you know like 50 years ago even even 30 years ago you have to be disciplined and practice and all that but you can sort of freeform it like you improvise when you 're in the ring so you 've got these kind of set pieces that you practice but you have to make snap decisions you know snap creative decisions about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually aspiring the aerial is the not really interested in in in hearts freak they 're really happy to be able to rely and someone like me that they can say well I just can grow up and then it soon be fine there is a trust there and I think that has to be a bit frosty Danny as a club we place a really big emphasis on the culture that we create and so we 've got lots of new players who have come to our club over the last few years and our ethos is that we want to be a place where they want to come where they feel included where they 're valued and you know you make lifelong friends here it 's always a good time we have a laugh we play a sport that we love it 's a home away from home it never told to do circus think it 's an amazing tool you can do whatever you want with it it can be as much involved or as little as you want now I 'm not really performing anymore but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still very valuable to have it as a women-only spice because I also don 't do not think that is that many around of course you need to love what you do you know learned over the years and to relax a little bit more into it which is good being able to go out and run around with your friends and really work hard for success there 's no sport like it I just recommend just get it out give it a go and that you never know where or take we the people of Maribyrnong declare our commitment to a community where opportunities for success are equally available to women and men where our mothers daughters and sisters live free from the cycle of violence where their thoughts ideas and opinions are heard and respected and their choices and goals in life

    "text": "three four five six seven eight one two three four five six there 's lots of focus on literacy and numeracy and education and sometimes that can come at the expense of including arts in education which is really a disappointment in a disadvantage to a lot of kids because by using art in education you 're actually helping kids engage in a completely different way into a completely different capacity it 's really great to give them a range of opportunities to explore those things and giving them that chance to learn without being aware that they 're learning so at the Women 's circus we work a lot with or we prioritize cross-sectoral partnerships so we really find it important to work in a partnership model where we 're collaborating with different organizations who kind of come with different sets of expertise so at the Women 's echeverra community arts organization we have that background we work with educational providers so in the context of this project we work with the school with the Western English language school man that 's a daddy what do you like doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you like the choppers this last plan was it scary yeah if Nick your big less deadly a little bit scary what else do you like I left that mini cam the mini what did you do on the mini exam we also worked with the maribyrnong early years alliance which was the organization behind who kind of initiated the project I 'm grace nickel I 'm the early years facilitator at maribyrnong City Council my role is to work with the early years alliance in maribyrnong which is made up of family support services education and care services health services and the Alliance works together to form partnerships and develop projects and activities around the movin on the early years plan but I suppose also to really support families to access early youth services within maribyrnong my name is Norville sang I 'm came from Bangladesh I my responsibilities of my job my I 'm chef my baby is starting questioning this la English school and they can be useful is very beautiful they can learn everything swimming gyms and like a circus I like the entertainment maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my name is Sandra Hamdi and I first heard of a circus program last year and we were quite keen with the ideas a full-on almost two hours activity for the children our students are predominantly refugees and they come from a variety of different countries there 's significant improvement for all students my name is James II I teach grades two to four on fridays and I Camden them to circus on Fridays it 's a very helpful program in many ways for the children namely in literacy numeracy physical well-being discipline and it 's really fun because children play minigames they do dance on the whole it 's a very it 's a good source of learning and it is children enjoy it because it 's done in a fun-filled atmosphere at the circus we find it really important to combine those different areas of expertise and we find that that has the best outcomes for the children because they have the support of the educational teachers that they see on a daily basis but they also kind of get to leave the educational institution and come and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things at the circus but with the support of the teachers that they have on a daily basis one of the things that I found most instrumental and my reasonings behind becoming a teacher was about holistic education and educating the whole child and making students really take ownership of their own learning all of those things are so easy to accomplish just by incorporating art into into your educational program from anywhere from just having making your own class plays or making your own artistic projects that are related to readings that you 've been doing in class up to having a chance to go in don 't go and join the circus this project was developed based on a whole range of research and linked into a number of early years frameworks and the curriculum the vowels which is what guides the curriculum in schools and there 's a real emphasis in those documents to use concrete experiences to help children get a real sense of experience with objects and things language communication with each other with their world to actually then go on to the more abstract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that because each week the children were in a really incredibly language rich environment they had repetition they needed to work with each other they needed to work with a range of adults and yeah while I while I was there watching it over the 10 weeks as its rolled out you could actually see the level of the confidence in the children grow you could see that understanding grow you could watch them from week to week have a deeper understanding a broader vocabulary a whole range of things like that and the teachers were talking about how children who 'd been previously withdrawn or may have had behaviors that are a little bit challenging in the classroom we 're now actually either talking or communicating with each other or being far more confident so I think the outcomes were very evident yeah hello my name is Subba my name is Raffy I and Sammy huh hello my name is alisha laine MC Blaine I come from Somalia I name is fat dosa my name is Ricky I come from Lima I I like dancing ila sharpies poses too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mini shot helped me to roll I 'd like the hoops because it is society having the opportunity to do something like circus with the same group of kids that you see every day and the same teachers give them the chance to get some accomplishment get some recognition for their physical abilities for their teamwork for their cooperation for their listening skills and just gives them that feedback which they can then take with them back to the classroom and that confidence just go I was you know I was with my teacher yesterday and she saw that I was really good on the trapeze and she was really proud of me and to help me and there 's photos of me on the wall doing amazing things so I know that if I put my hand up this time even if I don 't get it right at least I know that I can try and that 's the most important thing we can do for these kids"

please give her a warm welcome thank you norah good morning and may i add my thanks to each of you for joining us today for our annual international women 's day breakfast we 're thrilled to be able to come together once again and celebrate women 's strength and resilience something which we 've certainly relied on in the last 12 months i would just like to reflect for a moment though on the challenging year that we 've actually experienced firstly it 's actually been a year since we held our last breakfast who knew but last year as norah said you know it was our biggest event we 've held 333 people at carolina and we had no idea though that literally within 10 days covert 19 was going to impact how we lived how we interacted as a community and bring so many changes and challenges and consequences to what we were doing so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carolica hosted and while they 've continued to provide thousands of meals on wheels for our community here in maroondah as well as in knox they 've been closed to events into our community for the past 12 months so carolica 's doors will actually open again at the end of this month and so i encourage you all to actually have a look at their new website and come along to see some fabulous shows in 2021 i 'm very proud that our council has continued to provide the majority of its services during the past 12 months and in addition we implemented a range of support services for our community residents and businesses these have included things such as the be kind maroon to campaign which encouraged our community to be kind to yourself to others and to our local businesses we had marina connect a phone service which connected people in need often for the first time due to change circumstances to a range of support services available locally we had knit one warm one one of my favorites a partnership with our local community houses that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ donated to help those in our community who were sleeping rough or struggling financially we had marooned a moment 's photography project which saw people take photos of things and places that made them smile and then we shared them on our social channels to connect and inspire others the development of our recovery plan based on extensive feedback from our community we had input from over 3 000 of our local residents informing and engaging using a range of print online and digital channels and more recently i 'm sure some of you would be seeing the effects of our sunflower effect project which encouraged residents to plant sunflower seeds in their gardens to bring hope and brightness to their streets and neighborhoods there were thousands of seeds given out and i 'm sure if you 're walking out and about in maroondah you 'll actually see some sunflowers popping up i 've seen some myself well council 's been doing what it can to support our community i 'm sure each of you have been playing a role within your communities be they the schools businesses family or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day which is nora mentioned is actually monday is choose to challenge and while we 've certainly been challenged over recent times this theme is intended to celebrate the tremendous efforts by women and girls around the world in challenging gender bias and inequality these efforts reach back into the early 1900s when international women 's day first emerged in europe and the united states in celebrating international women 's day we pay tribute to the campaign by ordinary women for an improvement in poor working conditions for equal wages and for the right to vote as we 've mentioned the path to women 's equality has been long and it 's been challenging and i 'd like to take you through a couple of the stages that give us an important focus on how we can actually help forge the gender agenda together it started in 1800s as we talked about in the 1800s and the early 1900s we had activism we had women who were activists they were the suffragettes the suffragists and they fought hard for equality and the focus for them was largely on securing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through those 1900s we come to the 1970s in feminism we had a widespread feminist action which saw women rallying protesting and lobbying hard for inclusion influence and equality and the 1980s then saw an array of and you 're going to love that the the actual comment that they make with it the fix the women programs was what they were called it 's great isn 't it and while they were well-meaning in trying to help women become more confident visible well-networked and assertive unfortunately they also reinforced the notion that you needed to act like a man and fit into an existing patriarchal structure an organization if you were to succeed all the while still being a superwoman at home we all know that one so you know think those shoulder pads although i have to say i had a lot had a giggle to myself the other day because my daughter arrived home and she had a t-shirt and had shoulder pads and i went so you know think shoulder pads think power suits you know high heels and loud voices so i 'm sure for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then the 1990s and the naughties focused on organizational development maybe if we can change or fix the organizational structure women will thrive so the focus really then started to be for women in the boardroom really started to escalate as did more diverse recruiting inclusive talent pipelines and attention to our wider diversity groups just beyond gender such as race lgtb plus and so forth the number of women 's conferences and networks also increased significantly and continue to play a really important and necessary role across our countries in more recent years we had men as advocates and champions of change and that 's been recognised as a major trend in accelerating women 's equality and so here we are today i think you would agree that gender related conversations and activity are certainly on the rise back in 2017 and 2018 international women 's day was the most discussed topic on facebook by millions it beat the super bowl it beat everything pantone 's color of the year in 2018 was purple a woman 's color and i i noticed purple around me but i know for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inauguration in america was a really big example where we had kamala harris michelle obama and hillary clinton all in different shades of purple so it was certainly very obvious there and everywhere gender is on the mainstream radar and impacting the narrative stereotypes and biases are more likely to be called out so we 're moving to a very exciting time in history where the world now expects diversity and inclusion and equity last year we strived to be each for equal because an equal world is an enabled world and now in 2021 it 's up to us to choose to challenge and consistently commit to calling out inequity because with challenge comes change international women 's day now unites millions of women around the world and we as a collective here today acknowledge and celebrate the contribution that women continue to make to their workplaces to their families and to their communities i 'm incredibly proud that in maroondah five out of our nine councillors are women and that our representatives are chosen based on their skill sets and what they offer the community with no gender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equal opportunity to work in and run for local government so to this end we continue to work with our communities to encourage participation and increase the involvement in a number of women in public life uh our ceo reminded me a moment a moment ago and said to me are you going to mention you know the australian women 's local government women 's association which is one of those groups that is actually really working towards increasing the involvement in the number of women in public life international women 's day is a timely opportunity to recognise that women and girls have made and continue to make a difference in their communities and today when you look around and see the wide range of organizations and community groups represented here today it proves that miranda is incredibly fortunate to have so many wonderful women contributing to our community on your table you 'll find a leaflet with a little more information on international women 's day it 's got the menu as well but it 's also got a mailing list form so if you 're interested please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will contact for us for next year 's event and if you 'd like to join the social media conversation on international women 's day please use the hashtag which is also on your table as i 've already mentioned over the last year we 've learnt the importance of community and connection and one of the most powerful ways that we reach people is through our shared experiences sharing our stories finding common ground understanding and hope and through communication we build relationships we support each other and we drive our communities towards greater balance which brings us to today 's guest speakers two wonderful local women mandy and kate they formed a firm friendship through their similar family experiences both being the parents of twins with additional needs they wanted to share their experiences both the grief and the joys that come with parenting a child with additional needs and so in 2019 they launched two p 's in a podcast they 've since created a connection with an audience of supportive strong and determined women from all around the world we 're very

disability whether that be visible or invisible it 's really lonely and as a parent you can 't talk to other parents you know when you go to new mums group and you 're like i 'm breastfeeding i 'm not breastfeeding our issues are way different to that right our issues may be we have to let our kids stay home on naplan day so they don 't feel excluded we have to let our children do individual swimming lessons because they 're not capable of being in a group of really loud noises we have surgeries coming up we have illnesses yeah yeah it 's very very different but you don 't want to talk about that all the time and i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the pediatrician i 'd had some news that was a little bit unsettling i dropped the boys back to school popped into barclays for a coffee now milk and wine and i one of the mums at my table was like i just don 't know about the new scrunchies with the school uniform and i was like i gotta find my people so we started our podcast my daughters have a diagnosis of a hemiplegia cerebral palsy and even in that world of cerebral palsy i felt quite lonely and particularly having twins so um yeah that was another drive to talk about having twins and we had our twins prematurely as well so even that from the beginning was a difference yeah so we had went through the nikku special care nursery journey got our babies home when you have little tiny prem babies if they breastfeed the the strength of breastfeeding makes them lose weight the effort to breastfeed so all the things that you 're programmed as a mother and a woman you can 't do with these babies so we just realized that all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to take a breath because two babies you 've got two babies yeah and you 've also i had three other children which is insanity i know but we once we were 13 years down the track and we could take a breath we thought maybe there are other people that feel like us so we put the podcast out and then this most amazing moment happened when we were listening to annabelle crabbe and lee sales point have you ever listened to their podcast chat and look through their chatters here and annabelle had listened to our podcast and went on about it for about 10 minutes i was sitting on the toilet like not the toilet but i was just like and i was crying i was crying and then that day we had 10 000 downloads so the power of her voice she heard something in us yeah i don 't know anyway um that was a significant change in the podcast it really was went up to number two in the itunes show we were watching it like ten nine eight and just so excited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can 't believe it actually um and because of beautiful annabelle we went on mia friedman 's podcast which is called no filter and we got some more downloads and now which we can 't believe we get 30 000 downloads a week of our little podcast thank you for your please listen thank you thursdays thursdays and sometimes mondays made in a basement in heath that 's right yeah with no talent we started on we have a facebook page we have instagram loosely on twitter and we thought maybe we 'll start a group in facebook where all our listeners can come together and then they can care for each other and we can care for them so we call it the two p 's in a podcast hangout yep and we vet people coming in yeah we check everyone and it 's just been a lovely place of people with children with all sorts of diagnosis because everyone 's welcome yep you can have people that have a diagnosis of dyslexia to parents whose children have life-ending illnesses and we 're all in there together and no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i can 't even describe it and what 's been astonishing is all the professionals so doctors nurses pediatricians professors people mandy and i are to get asked to go and speak at medical conferences i just want to say diploma in nursing diploma in child care but we say to them we are professors yeah we 're p festivals yes we 've got nearly 16 years yeah that 's right yeah that 's right um we also had a beautiful we met a beautiful family in there that run merchandise yes they said we 'd like to do you know your t-shirts and all that sort of bezos but you have to if you run a small business you 'll know that when you want to buy merchandise you have to actually buy it yes right so you 've got to spend ten thousand dollars yeah of that we had none so this beautiful pea family who run a merchandise store paid for it all mandy and i just get the profit we don 't have to put any money up front so merch p as we call in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his name 's luke and he 's a massive guy he actually changed our life because all the peas can have a little badge or a bag and doctors with lanyards so if they 're in the hospital then families can see them oh okay you sort of get a little bit be friendly pee friendly um yeah last international women 's day we did our first live show so and that was in sydney yeah um and was funny because we had toilet paper on the table it 's like this is a bit of a joke people are buying toilet paper and then 11 months later not so funny so we had we had a live show it was going to be in lillian lillian and then one in yaraville so they were cancelled so that was a great disappointment yes everything was everything was it was a time of disappointment wasn 't it and when we plan our shows unlike this amazing breakfast which is awesome we do them at a time when pee parents can get there so we do early evening or afternoon i want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can organize their support workers or their carers or their family members we want to make it easy because we know what it 's like to feel like the world is inaccessible yeah that 's right so um there 's lots of venues that we can 't use for our live shows actually lots and lots so we 're rather limited but the peas don 't care yeah they come anyway so um when we did our live show in sydney abc sydney were also like can you come on the radio and we were like okay i mean why not um and the greatest thing ever i don 't know if you 've been to abc sydney but in the foyer are the play school toys and so they 're big like as big as us these toys so we we got to have photos with them we saw dr carl oh i can 't even tell you is that dr carlos our doctor was like to stay cool we met osha osha came on our podcast so that was really really nice um and the most amazing thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yep 110 days of remote learning or not learning yeah not even remotely learning [Laughter] my daughters go to three different schools one is a special school one in primary school one in a high school and so that was probably one of the most challenging times without a doubt it was really really we can 't even talk no we can 't give us another 10 years and we talk about remote learning i did hear a great joke about remote learning though which was you can 't call it homeschooling because it 's not from the homeschooling region of france you 've got to call it sparkling remote learning so we learn about zoom we learn about teams we learn about all the rest of them oh my gosh so many different yeah programs oh that noise when the microsoft teams goes out the microsoft we 've got to change that we 're doing all triggers we can 't hear that anymore we did also become new people so this is principal hoes and i 'm your eight coordinator jones that 's so we decided to record two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lockdown so and what we were doing was getting people to ring into us and tell us what 's it like for you what 's it like for your child what 's it like for your child in mainstream that 's funded what 's it like for children in special schools sds 's who 's talking about our children during a pandemic and so we did that and we 're so proud to be on the record for that and we know the association for children with a disability were listening and they were going to the government and telling them it 's really hard for our kids you 've got to open the special schools yes and you 've got to let the kids with additional needs go back yeah because it 's impossible to have your aide zoom in and it 's just it 's just impossible some of you here are integrating as you would have lived through yeah you yes workers in this country it is um the best thing that mandy and i have is these children with incredible senses of humor their timing is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we spend half the time laughing it 's just such a joy and one morning before lockdown last year we were getting ready for school and um sorry for the small child here block your ears um we were getting ready for school and i walked in and we used pseudonyms for our children and i just heard from the bathroom i 'm like what 's going on so i go in and my son woody 's just looking at himself in the mirror i 'm like what are you doing he 's like getting all my shits out before school and i want to give that to you today international women 's international women 's day go into the bathroom look at yourself in the mirror and get your shits out the most astonishing thing well probably second most yeah was that penguin gave us a book deal uh unbelievable a two book deal yeah two book deals thank you so we write our first book in september in that second lockdown we did they said to us we had to have it to them by the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remote let 's try and mandy and i wrote the book via snapchat i don 't advise this but it just happened so i 'd like send her a snapchat have you done anything about it and she 's like yeah yeah do you remember that time filters oh filters the whole time because we didn 't put any makeup on for nine months that 's right um and so we wrote the book and then we got gave it to a penguin random house in um september and they 're like oh we never thought you 'd actually get it to us in that time so he 's so stressed um anyway if you ask a woman to do something they 'll do it so we handed that book in and they said now they won 't take any excuses from any authors because if we can do it home schooling kids yep that 's right um so the book 's called the invisible life of us yep comes out on the second of july we will be doing a book tour covered willing yeah okay the the biggest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can 't even tell you i can 't so i 'm at home my phone rings with an unknown number and because i have a business phone and a personal phone but sometimes real estate agents give out my personal number i 'm like oh should i answer should i just let it go to voicemail i answered and this woman said hi it 's sue here from the department of premier and cabinet and i 'm like this is one of my friends just ringing me for a joke and i was like okay and she 's like yeah we just wanted to let you know that um you and mandy have been shortlisted um and you are one of four victorians that have been short-lived for australian of the year and i just laughed i just thought what why i still i still don 't know why i was standing out in the middle of my street because my house is small and taking phone calls with five people in the house support workers dogs children husband so i 'd take my phone calls in the middle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was like uh okay i was laughing and then and then we cried this is an extreme honor and i was like oh yeah thank you but the most beautiful thing about being nominated was we knew we weren 't going to win look at beautiful grace who won so we just got to enjoy it i mean we didn 't get to meet dan no it was all on zoom we were really hoping that we might get to meet uh the chief health officer kate 's got his mask i have got his mask i 've got his calendar from corey isn 't it i think it is from croydon yeah there you go so you know we live in hope yeah and we also got nominated in two categories in the podcast awards so i don 't know you probably haven 't listened to our podcast we do a whole episode on awards right and we 're not in favor of them so during lockdown to be nominated for two awards was quite ironic yeah so yeah we we think life is its own reward and um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sneeze but that 's our opinion um yeah then we hit the one million downloads that was just it was amazing yeah yeah it still is amazing yeah yeah i can 't believe it and then we did this amazing thing we got a thing called a car supporter so our podcast is through a company called acast um they just upload your podcast for you and get your money for ads basically but they 're really great and both of our contacts there are women and they really really support us so they rang us up and they said we 're going to add a little thing to the podcast called supporter and it just means if people want to donate they can like a patreon but this is no we never wanted our listeners to feel like if they had to pay then they might miss out on something you know some podcasts are like pay this you get extra episodes we don 't have time for that no so we did and we didn 't ever want anyone to miss out no so it was just if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could yeah and lots and lots and lots of our listeners yeah can 't both work that 's right so if you have children with additional needs or disabilities working is really hard that 's why we have our own business because we have to be flexible so we didn 't want to make people pay for anything we 're like okay so they rolled this a-car supporter out across the world now i don 't know if you 've heard of my dad wrote a porno there 's some huge podcasts they 're all with a cast and us anyway a cast rang us after about a week and they 're like you you your podcast has received more money than any podcast in the world it still makes me want to cry i know it doesn 't make me want to cry and people write hilarious things this is for mandy 's omo that she can 't afford this week or this is for a new dress or this is for woody 's getting your shits out yeah we got um chappa chop money because when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children if you don 't answer when you come back to school i 'm not going to give you a chopper chop now my boys the thought of talking on a screen and maybe getting an answer wrong so one of my beautiful boys has a scribe at school who writes for him so he 's not going to yell out and so he just looked at me and i was like don 't worry it doesn 't matter thank god it was on mute because i may have said something else um and then one of our listeners put in the supporter twenty dollars buy those bloody chopper chops so we got a whole bag [Laughter] so anyway we thought what else can we do with this i cast money we can 't just buy omo and choppa chups and also because we don 't want uh we wanted to have like a charity arm but it 's too much work you can 't register a charity either well also like how do we give back yeah but who do we give back to you because all the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs so we came up with we came up with a booklet so we 've got this booklet which we are launching on mother 's day of this year so this year from the second to the eighth of march may may is international p week we 've claimed it i 'm calling it p week p week so we should say that a p is a parent of a child with a disability yes that 's right that 's right so but we have everybody welcome some people who are in our p tribe now you may not like this phrase but you may be one are rectums okay so we had a parent who has a no it 's actually a person who doesn 't have any children with disabilities write to us and say so what are the people called that just sprout to you all the time are they rectums and it 's just stuck it 's just people come up to us say hi i 'm michelle i 'm a rectum all the time so we love our rectums really [Laughter] um anyway so we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this booklet and this booklet is called letters to you a booklet of hope for parents when you go to the doctor or specialist or pediatrician and you get a diagnosis for your child you leave with the heaviest heart you can imagine because what they tell you is a tiny snapshot of your child and they tell you all the worst case scenarios that 's their job right they have to tell you your child has a global developmental delay your child may never walk your child may you may may never may never when you have a baby everyone tells you all the maze your child might go to university your child might be sports captain no one tells you the won 'ts but when you have a child with additional needs you get all the won 'ts and then you leave and you 're looking at that child or in my case little twins in the back seat i love them just as much they 're the same child so we decided no when you get your diagnosis you get a booklet of hope right so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven stories in here from amazing pea parents and an adult that lives with a disability to tell people it 's actually great life 's not what you thought it was going to be and also you can belong with us yeah yeah like it 's a day where you feel lonely then you know that we are here yeah that 's right and we will support you so that booklet we 're going to ask you to give us money at the end you know that 's where that 's going um and that money will go to that so not new dresses no no no new dresses so today before we finish we wanted to challenge you just like we 've all been challenged for international women 's day and we want to call you in we want to call you into our p tribe and we are going to tell you a story about a beautiful pea briony she is a friend of ours and she 's just started actually working at the royal children 's and she said she was getting out of her car and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her child getting the wheelchair out bags all sorts of things and bryony said i just thought what am i going to do and she said i went over to the mum and said how can i help and then she said no hang on what can i do to help you yeah instead of how can i help then make the mum come up with the idea right so what can i do to help you yep so not just when you see someone struggling when you see a child beautiful beautiful child having a tantrum in the supermarket that child 's not badly behaved that child is having a sensory overload and they can 't cope this is the greatest thing you don 't have to judge them and you don 't have to judge their parents okay you really don 't so if you could have seen me running down the road from primary school every morning chasing children carrying people with crying from the exhaustion of school days and luckily for me i 've got beautiful friends that live here in marina because we are down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help me carry children home for me bring me meals drop them at my door yep help with school drop-offs and pick-ups oh everything amazing community in miranda yes but what we want to say is you are actually able to go to that parent or carer and say hi my name 's kate what can i do to help you and if they say nothing you say that 's fine yeah don 't take it don 't have to walk past when i had twins with severe adhd running each way if someone had grabbed one i would have wept with relief so you don 't you can actually ask it 's okay and when we talk about not judging parents we all do it we 're all a little bit judgy judgey but it actually changes your whole life and mandy and i wanted to say every time one of you put a facebook post up and go oh tough day at work hitting the shardy we won 't judge you either and some of you might know how it feels to be excluded and we 've had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot but i want you to say when you do invite our children to birthday parties you make the whole family happy and we put that invitation on the fridge and we say look you 've been invited yep and that we go and buy presents like you 've never seen before you will you will get a really good you will get a great present from us because we women for that invite us yeah we went through two if we invite the twins yeah you get two invited twins no one ever invites twins um and the thing is you may think our kids don 't know they 're being excluded they know they know the mums know and the mums know and and we won 't hang out with you because you don 't want to hang out with our kids but we just got bloody one and a half million downloads on our podcast so we 're not horrible people you might like hanging out with us so 30 000 people a week are drawn to these conversations and it 's not just our stories we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our podcasts the first couple are about us after that yeah you see the death of us think you really are so we listen to our podcast if you 'd like but if you if that you don 't want it that 's fine but please come in come and be a

steen robot can i just ask how do you actually come up with new ideas every week to keep the podcast yeah um we find it really hard to chat we 've never we 've got so much to say we actually choose some really cool topics we 've got empathy um the r and s word you know don 't say those words anymore we 've got all of our years so newborns nikku two to five years starting school yeah yeah we interview and then we just interview people that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basically to start with family members my dad 's an identical twin he came on one episode that was fun i 've got a list i 've got a

yes um so i 'm actually a member of the sort of p community in the p hangout um so i just wanted to say a massive thank you and just express how amazing these women are um because i think it can be really isolating and feel really lonely yeah um and i think there 's actually more people on this journey than you realize yeah and i think it 's until we start having those open conversations about you know kids with disabilities additional needs even adults like there 's one in five of us yeah but i think it would be very hard at our workplaces to say like who are the one in five because people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just yeah thank you from the bottom of my heart for finding a place that it 's okay to be me and feel supported and just a lot less isolated lovely thank you we made it for you we

    "text": "[Music] welcome to Miranda 's maternal and child health service digital workshop on feeding your baby i 'm tahni one of the maternal and child health nurses introducing your baby to solid foods at the right time is an important step in their development to keep them happy and healthy please remember though that this is a general guide only there is no one universal guideline on feeding babies over six months of age different cultures and countries will introduce different foods at varying ages according to custom for families needing individualized information please speak with your local maternal and child health nurse the World Health Organization and national infant feeding guidelines recommend exclusively breastfeeding babies until they are at least six months of age babies who do not breastfeed need infant formula when babies reach six months their iron stores decrease and they need food to support their growth and development all babies developed differently so please watch your baby for signs that they are ready to start solids you will see your baby has good head control and can sit unsupported they might start reaching for your food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also develop more control of their tongue and open their mouth when food is offered try not to wait too long after six months to start solids as your baby needs nutrients from other foods to continue to grow and develop if your baby is younger than six months old when they start showing these signs you can start solids but only offer simple foods until they reach six months once you start your baby on solids the goal is to increase the variety of foods they eat so they get all the nutrients they need you should focus on iron rich foods as these will give your baby energy they need to learn play and grow it helps to maintain a healthy immune system and supports optimal brain growth remember solids can be introduced in any order at six months of age your baby can have red meat fish tofu beans lentils vegetables fruits and dairy foods such as full fat yogurt cheese eggs and custom you should also continue to offer breast milk or formula until your baby is at least 12 months old it 's also important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this can help reduce your baby 's risk of developing a food allergy these foods include well-cooked egg nuts in the form of a post fish wheat and cow 's milk but not as a drink if there is a family history or a known allergy in your baby it 's good to seek individualized professional advice the best time to offer your baby solids is generally within an hour of milk feeds and at a time of day when both you and your baby are relaxed remember to be patient as your baby may start eating only one to two teaspoons of food at a time this will increase with practice and as they start to get a taste for their favorite foods you can increase the number of meals each day once your baby is eating a couple of tablespoons per setting after eight months you can start offering foods before a milk feed this is the beginning of weaning from breast or formula milk feeds you can continue to offer it in reduced amounts as the baby gets older for example after eight months of age you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around twelve months of age your baby should be eating most of your family meals in a modified form for example roast meat veggies slow-cooked casseroles pastas and sandwiches babies do not need any added salt or sugar in their foods if you are cooking with a stock you should use a low sodium product some foods will still need to be cut into smaller pieces according to your baby 's individual development remember it often takes babies and toddlers repeated exposure to a food before they develop a like and acceptance babies will often refuse new foods when they are first often it 's important for parents to remember they decide on the food offered and when it will be offered babies will decide on how much they will eat babies have fluctuating appetites and they will vary how much they eat from day to day if the first foods you introduce a smooth you need to introduce more textured foods quickly to encourage your baby to chew to help with this you can offer food that they can hold themselves like soft pieces of cooked fruit or vegetables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something to chew on grated cheese makes a great finger food you can also give food more texture by leaving it slightly lumpy when you 're mashing up research shows that infants not given lumpy textured foods until after 10 months of age have more feeding difficulties at 15 months than those given lumpy food between 6 and 9 months of age there are some foods that can be dangerous for babies under 12 months and should be avoided these include honey raw eggs or foods that pose a choking risk honey may contain a bacteria that causes botulism which can make babies very unwell they also do not need foods with added salt or sugar while babies can have well-cooked egg it is important they are not served raw egg in any format for example mayonnaises and some sources while it can be very distressing to see your baby trying to clear their throat it is important to remember that choking is very different to gagging gagging is a reflex action that helps to prevent choking in fact unlike gagging where the child will make a retching noise choking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or cry and they may develop a blue tinge to their skin gagging is a common response when infants are making the transition from smooth to lumpy foods or when learning to chew it can be triggered by fingers food a spoon or toy is touching the back of the mouth the gag reflex reduces at around six months of age the same time at which most babies are learning to eat solid foods some children have a sensitive gag reflex and will gag more easily a child that gags often will cough to dislodge the food or vomit this is okay but it 's important to remember that babies and young children are always supervised when eating items smaller than a 20 cent piece can choke a child aged 3 years unless for example raw hard pieces of fruit or veggies pieces of meat bones sausage skins and nuts as your child progresses with developmental milestones different risks may present to give you peace of mind it might be a good time to consider attending a first aid course for children under 12 months of age breast milk or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Health Organization recommends giving babies cooled boiled water from six months of age this should be offered in an age-appropriate cup you should not give your baby any sweet drinks these include all fruit juices flavored milks soft drinks energy drinks cordials and flavored water either purchased or made at home juice comes from fruit and vegetables and is easily mistaken as healthy alternatives to water however sweetened drinks can lead to a variety of undesired outcomes for your baby in full cream milk is a great source of protein calcium and other nutrients however make sure that it has been pasteurized you can introduce cow 's milk to your baby 's food by adding it to cereal making it into a sauce on top of meat veggies or pasta but it 's important that it 's not used as a replacement for breast milk or formula until after the age of 1 other things to note dairy should be for creme varieties until at least the age of two and never give

their own needs and situation to make the experience as enjoyable for all of you try to make mealtime social and fun you can do this by having meals together as a family and turning off the TV or devices at mealtimes don 't force or bribe your baby to eat they will do it in their own time all you need is a soft spoon a plate or a bowl any other gadgets they are not developmentally ready for can pose a safety risk and are not recommended and remember getting messy is all part of this enjoy the experience with your baby and try not to worry about what gets thrown on the floor or smeared into their clothing we 've already talked through a lot of information but here 's some key points I want you to remember babies often refuse new food when they are first offered it this is normal and

    "text": "[Music] welcome to miranda 's maternal and child health service digital workshop on sleep and settling for your baby i 'm tracy one of the maternal child health nurses your baby 's cues can be very subtle and easily overlooked this video will help you start identifying these cues and give you the confidence in responding to them have you noticed your baby yawning and rubbing their eyes these are just some of the baby 's cues that you can use to establish a sleep routine at around three to four months of age some predictability around your day-to-day routines can start to emerge it 's important to remember every baby is different but be mindful of how busy you are and your family are when trying a new routine or pattern if you are already feeling stressed it might not be the best time to try to start something new if your baby is unwell this is also not the time to introduce a new routine focus on sharing lots of cuddles with your baby and look at a routine when you are feeling ready now let 's have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your baby to bed the most important thing is to make sure they can sleep safely babies should always sleep on their back from birth with their head and face uncovered to prevent them from slipping under the blankets place them at the lower end of the cot no pillows or toys should be in the cot bumpers tunas and quilts are not recommended babies can overheat so make sure the room temperature isn 't too high light and breathable sleeping bags are best for sleeping don 't put your baby in jumpers tight clothes or bibs and lastly a cot that meets australian safety standards is the safest place for your baby to sleep so what signs do you need to look for to know your baby is ready for sleep there are a range of different signs and they can come on quickly for infant 0-12 months you might notice they start to turn away from you they may begin rubbing their eyes or become jerky with their movements sometimes you can get their attention back again but you will notice this gets harder your baby may even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signs that your baby is tired if you can respond at this point with a nappy change a cuddle or some quiet time you might have success in getting them to sleep otherwise babies will progressively show more tired signs like yawning and even redness around their eyes and eyebrows if you haven 't noticed earlier signs this is the time you should be getting your baby ready for sleep to get them ready for bed change your baby into their sleeping bag and place them in their cot their eyes may be open but they are ready for sleep it 's okay to leave the room if your baby is quiet and relaxed it 's common to have to go in and support your baby soon after you have left them so don 't go too far away and listen for noises coming from their room if your baby starts to make some unsettled noises or maybe even cry attend to them quickly especially if this is new for you and your baby when you enter the room you don 't want to get their attention but you also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cot you can put your hands through the bars and comfort your baby you could try one hand over their arms and the other patting them while using your voice to shush try to match your baby 's cues here if they are raising their cries you can increase your shush volume so they can hear you and pet them to help them save a gentle reassuring voice or dummy could also be tried as your baby starts to calm down you can decrease the support you give them and eventually leave the room again you may need to do this a few times before your baby settles into sleep if you can 't see them sometimes babies will also respond if you turn them on their side in the cot either facing you or away from you this might be something you can try before resorting to picking them up for a cuddle if you do roll them on their side to fall asleep you must return them to their back sleeping position before you leave the room so how do you help your baby adapt to this new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it might take a while for your baby to fall asleep in their cot this is okay you are trying something new and supporting your baby by being there there are a few tips to remember grizzling and fussing for a short period of time is normal for a baby when they are falling asleep this sometimes tapers off to silence and then sleep listen to your baby cry if the cry is escalating in intensity it 's time to pick them up and calm them down if the cry has pauses continue with supporting them in the cot with the settling techniques it 's important for you to feel comfortable with the bedtime process if you are finding it difficult listening to your baby cry while helping them settle it 's okay to pick them up and calm them sometimes it can be easier to have someone with you for support when establishing a sleep routine a regular routine gives babies cues that is time to sleep knowing the right time to offer your baby sleep will make settling easier the things they begin to associate with sleep include @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cot each time other things that might help to encourage sleep include removing items from the cot or surrounds to eliminate distractions you can also try hands-on settling this is a very responsive type of settling which can be helpful when you are getting to know your baby and what they like like adults all babies are different and will respond to things differently you will know your baby best so if you have a very unsettled baby and the tips we 've just talked through haven 't helped then it 's okay to let them sleep in your arms it can be helpful for you and the baby and is a step in the right direction we expect new routines to take two to three weeks to see change but progress does happen along the way so as you start to see your baby coat better with the new routine you can start to extend the time that you go in to help them get back to sleep or you can look at changing other elements of their routine as well so once your baby has settled how long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep cycle with periods of light sleep and deep sleep they will start to wake at around 30 to 40 minute mark but this doesn 't mean they are ready to get up yet we recommend trying to resettle your baby at this point sleep promotes sleep so if your baby starts putting shorter sleeps together this can lead to a longer overnight sleep cycle resettling can often be more challenging process for your baby than putting them down for their first sleep so if your baby is starting to wake up you can resettle them by providing the same supports you did when they fell asleep but remember your baby won 't always fall back asleep and may start crying it 's okay to pick them up if they are getting too upset and have no breaks and they 're crying you should try to put them back down to sleep two or three times even if you are only able to get them to have a short nap after their longer sleep it is still going to be beneficial for them if you 've tried to settle them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them out of the room try to have 10 to 15 minute play with them you 'll often see tired signs during this time so you can respond with cuddles and again off asleep in the cot if this doesn 't work you might need to stop trying in the cot and go for a walk give your baby a bath or simply change the environment if at any point your baby is crying and you are feeling overwhelmed as long as your baby is in a safe place take a moment to regroup maybe call for some help and then attend to your baby when you are calm how do you work out your routine a good pattern for the day is the feed play sleep routine this might begin with feed play sleep play sleep routine if possible you should try to avoid giving your baby a snack feed in between the main feed times sometimes you can get into a snack and nap routine that can result in a baby being difficult to read or one who is happy for only a short time however if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please feed them when your baby reaches 3 months of age you also need to think about weaning babies from being swaddled you might even need to do this sooner if your baby is already rolling you will know your baby best so regularly ask yourself if you think your baby wants to be swaddled as not all babies need to sleep like this another challenging time for you and your baby might be at around six weeks of age this is a peak crying time for babies at this time your baby is going through a typical developmental phase and they will cry more than normal and it can be difficult to work out how to settle them this is the time to call on family or friends to help out just to get through and get some rest yourself your maternal child health nurse is also available for support if needed babies needs will change as they grow learn and develop sometimes they will go for a period of sleeping longer through the night then suddenly change this pattern this can be very confusing for parents as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to continue we explain these changes by thinking about your baby 's development and growing as they grow and learn they will need your support in different ways with consistent messages from parents and by noticing your baby 's cues routines will start to get back on track finally i just want to remind you that it is important to be kind to yourself and some days will be good and go as planned others will be more challenging please don 't forget that if you are needing extra support with sleep or any other parenting concerns please call your maternal child health nurse and most importantly enjoy spending the time with your family [Music]"

    "text": "[Music] in November last year we released the draft Croydon community well-being precinct master plan inviting you to tell us what you liked and what you wanted to see improved we received great feedback from our community which has helped us develop a revised master plan for the precinct one that reflects the great ideas and suggestions from our community starting here the mount dandenong Road end of the site we 're ensuring that the history of Croydon won 't be lost with the existing heritage elements being incorporated into the design the front of this majestic old theater currently known as EVs and the maternal child health center known to some as the cottage are proposed to be incorporated into the new well-being hub a building originally the draft master plan proposed two separate yet connected community hub buildings the revised master plan sees both of those buildings consolidated into one hub a larger proposed ground-floor footprint will ensure that the Croydon library is entirely on the ground floor something that we heard was very important to our library users the detailed design elements for this exciting new building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through more community consultation providing further opportunity for the community to have a say on the precinct outcomes something else that was important to our library users was maintaining the connection between the library and the existing duck pond much like the current coordinate library building the new community hub a is proposed to include large glazed windows and a place to sit so you can look out into the duck pond we 're also proposing a revitalization of the duck pond and improvements the ecosystem for the wildlife that call it home one of the major highlights of the new plan is the proposed increase to usable open space available for our community the precinct is proposed to go from having 1.3 7 hectares of opens bass 41.7 three hectares that 's equivalent to more than seven basketball courts of additional usable open space the proposed open space includes grassed areas that could be used for kicking the footy having a picnic and outdoor cinema or even weekend markets for those who love their music the amphitheater is proposed to be a space for local bands and musicians to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your space for dance bands music and functions to replace the spaces available in the current EVs and Keystone Hall buildings families will also be able to enjoy the new playground and basketball half-court we 've also managed to increase parking spaces in the precinct additional accessible car parking spots are proposed right next to Hebei and the library this will make it easier for people to access all areas of the precinct at the top right of the precinct there is a proposed mixed-use development partnership opportunity this doesn 't include any sailor land and would complement and further enhance the precincts health and well-being focus down at the southern end councils former service center and officers are proposed to be transformed into well-being hub B this approach will provide more spaces for community groups or partnership opportunities across the car park tucked beside the Athletics track a new proposed multi-purpose hub will replace Keystone Hall this hub will back onto two new bowl screens with space for croydon Bowls Club RSL and the existing sporting groups in the precinct so what are the next steps the revised master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we strongly encourage you to provide your thoughts and comments then your same Orinda website has the plans available for review this will be an exciting project for the Croydon community and we want to ensure that it meets the needs of our community now and well into the future to share your thoughts on the revised plan for the Croydon community well-being precinct jump onto our your same rinder page"

of my favorites so we 'll be reading paddington today paddington mines the house one morning mrs brown and mrs bird went out for the day and left paddington to look after the house i shall wash up all the breakfast things while you were gone he said and then if i have any time left over i might do some spring cleaning oh dear said mrs brown i don 't like the sound of that as soon as the others had gone paddington set to work he washed all the breakfast cups and sauces and plates and put them in a rack to dry then he did the dusting and after that he washed the dusters and the towels and he hung them up to dry when he had finished hanging up the dusters and towels he started making a special chocolate cake as a surprise for mrs brown and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was soon busy mixing flour and coca and sugar and milk together in a large bowl it wasn 't until he put his pore in the mixture to make sure it tasted as it should that he saw he had made a mess with the flour and the coker worse still the floor felt crunchy under his feet where he had spilled some sugar so he got the vacuum cleaner out that was when his troubles started in his haste to tidy the kitchen he put the hose on the wrong end of the cleaner by mistake and instead of sucking it blew paddington staggered back as all the old dust came out and rose in the air like a big black cloud it landed everywhere on the clean cups and sauces and plates over the dusters and towels he had hung to dry over the table and chairs and floor it even landed in his cake mix paddington decided it was a good thing he was making a chocolate cake at least it wouldn 't show the dirt paddington started work all over again he washed the breakfast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hung them up to dry and because the dusters were now wet he thought he would use the vacuum cleaner to get rid of the dust this time he made sure the tube was on the right end using the vacuum cleaner was much more fun and paddington spent some time trying to write his name in the dust on top of the table it wasn 't until he got as far as the letter d that he noticed the mixing bowl was now empty he stared at the end of the hose wondering what to do next paddington wasn 't the sort of bear to be beaten and looking at the end of the hose pipe gave him an idea what had happened once it could happen again he put the hose back onto the wrong end of the cleaner and then stood back waiting to see if the cake mix would get blown out for a second or two nothing came out and he was about to poke a spoon down inside to see if that would help when there was a loud rushing noise one moment the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next it looked as if he had had raining chocolate paddington gaze unhappily around the room it was in a worse state than before in fact he couldn 't remember even having seen such a mess he gave a deep sigh and for the third time that day he set to work he washed the breakfast things then he washed the dusters and the tea towels and hung them up to dry then he scrubbed the floor and washed the walls and polished the table and chairs until it all looked as as new in fact he cleaned everything except himself but by then it was too late for there was a ring at the front doorbell paddington cried mrs brown whatever have you been up to are you all right you 're covered in spots brown ones said mrs bird paddington looked at himself in the hall mirror and saw for the first time what a mess he was in i think i must have a bad attack of spring cleaning fever mrs brown he said mrs bird hurried into the kitchen but she had to admit that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if she wondered why paddington had spots on his duffel coat as well as in his whiskers she didn 't say anything i think she said you had better go get upstairs and have a nice hot bath paddington thought that was a very good idea he felt tired after all his hard work afterwards when he was safely tucked in bed mrs brown brought him his supper on a tray you 're looking better already she said the rest must have been doing you good it isn 't so much spring cleaning that brings you out and spots mrs brown said paddington it 's all the clearing up that you have to do

are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way while maintaining the landscape trees and views that make marooned a great place to live some of the regulations in the framework are mandatory while others are used as guidelines meaning some changes can be made to find out what planning regulations apply to your land or any land a maroon des please visit councils website if you 're planning on developing your land there 's a process set out by the Victorian Government that you must follow Council will make the process as simple as possible for you by breaking it down into various steps step 1 research before you lodge an application you should familiarize yourself with a maroon DE planning scheme to make sure it 's in line with a planning framework council officers can meet with you to talk through the plans in a pre-application meeting is also important to engage with a professional like a town planner or an architect as they 'll also be familiar with the planning framework and can help prepare the application or even lodge it on your behalf step 2 load your application once you have all the information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ submitting it online or at a council service center you will be required to pay an application fee at this stage if a builder or architect is lodging the application on your behalf they will be legally considered the applicant so all correspondence will go through them not you step 3 council will review your application this process includes checking it against the planning framework to see if it meets all required regulations making sure they have enough information to assess it and also referring the application to third parties such as Yarra Valley Water and VicRoads to see if the application will affect public assets and services step 4 advertising the application during this step the surrounding neighbors might be sent a letter advising them of the application and a sign will be put up on site this gives everyone affected by the proposed development up to 14 days to provide their feedback and any suggested changes if council receives any objections we will work with the applicant and objector to try and resolve the concerns this may mean changes to the application but remember if plans go against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being refused so some compromise may be necessary step 5 formal assessment during this step council will assess the application along with all of the collected information if any objections still remain counsel must consider these carefully if there are a significant number of objections council may decide to host a public meeting these sessions are a chance for planning offices and ward councillors to hear from the applicant and objectors and to try and resolve any issues the final application and objections received are then assessed under the maroon des planning scheme with a recommendation included in a planning report step 6 decision there are three possible outcomes for an application Council will either approve the application refuse the application or approve the application with changes if anyone is unhappy with the council 's decision a seven-step might take place step 7 appeal once a decision is made by council it is final however the applicant or objector has the right to appeal council 's decision to the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal known as vacant this process is undertaken directly with VCAT and has its own time frame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is cool to give evidence to defend its decision to the tribunal so what do you do if you want to reject to an application it is important that you understand the proposal before you make a formal submission against the application the plans will be available on councils website and if you need help understanding the plans you can make an appointment to discuss the application with a council officer to lodge your submission you can complete an online form or provide a written statement your objection must include an explanation of how you would be affected if the permit was approved and how your concerns could be addressed while still keeping within the planning guidelines so now you should have a better understanding of the planning permit process remember to give your application the best chance of success you should carefully consider the planning framework and marooned a planning scheme when designing your development get professional help to develop your plans and application talk to your neighbors about your ideas early in the process submit a thorough application be responsive to councils request along the way be open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerns the best chance of being resolved you should focus on the quality of your objection not the quantity of objections clearly identify how you will be affected by the proposed development refer to the planning framework and marooned a planning scheme suggest solutions to your concerns participate in a planning consultation meeting if health be open to negotiation and compromise it 's important to remember counsel is here to listen to everyone 's voice before making a decision if you still have any questions on the application or objection process please speak to a planning officer you [Music]"
