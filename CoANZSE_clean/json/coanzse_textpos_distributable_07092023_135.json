Canberra and I don 't want amber country out in Sutton I 've been sort of working here in Canberra as an artist in various ways shapes or form for a long time longer than I 'll say publicly I 'm not even that old and now I make sculpture primarily video and photography but under the umbrella of sculpture yeah my name is Anna Katie and I am from Ottawa on my father 's side and I grew up in Blenheim which is top of the South Island and currently I practice and live in Wellington and my artistic practice is kind of similar to Dane I 'm trained as a sculptor but the sculpture umbrella is pretty wide covers lots of different things including video and sound now the exchange that 's happening this year it 's the first time it 's been run why were you interested in it your your practice your little bubble your your sphere of influence is a good one as an artist I think you 're you know wears visual creatures and so when you you 're able to be somewhere else many people it 's able to turn different cogs yeah for sure any opportunity to think about your practice in a different context there 's always really really useful myself my practice is quite located at home so coming to Canberra in Australia yeah there are lots of different things to think about but yeah I mean it was similar to Anna you know through through meeting her and her network so I was able to do all sorts of things I got sort of access I supposed to the depths of the collection at take Papa I was taken through their War Memorial which was fascinating and it 's just an absolutely stunning and incredibly interesting place so tell us about why the War Memorial helped was that yeah the exchange for you well I think the the projects that have started around sort of indigenous service and those complications and being about transcultural morning and how and what is the role of the institution I suppose in those practices and so I went for Anzac Day he was there for the dawn service and that was quite interesting because I was expecting it to somehow be different and now I realize which was quite foolish because it was almost exactly the same and you know it 's sort of that was quite an interesting sort of light bulb moment but I think you know it was an that was sort of the entry point and I think like any sort of art project or artwork he sort of started somewhere but inevitably end up somewhere completely different when I first got here I have a pretty laid out way that I thought things were going to go my research here is particularly about indigenous language and the relearning of indigenous language and how that relates to artwork I 'm not sure that I 'll walk down the Avenue there I thought I was going to and I feel sort about the project I 'm still researching and like Jane said like a chance to get to experience a place and maybe the deeper thinking and the produce that have come coming out afterwards one of the important parts obviously is the arts engagement itself but another part specifically with this exchange this residency is the cultural exchange have you got any reflections on how that 's gone for you yeah I mean it was fascinating to be in writing so I was I was lucky enough to be given a potpourri which is a traditional welcome I got this beautiful cloak that was worn by one of the princes that are actually really deeply moving sort of process and I felt from that point you know welcomed there 's so many complexities to do with people 's language their language groups like like their relationship to the place that they are so just talking to some of the contexts I 've made here has been really powerful in terms of that idea of cultural exchange there 's lots of things that we have in common but there 's also lots of things that are quite challenging and different and have I 've got to spend time with lots of different people and they 've been so generous with their time and showing me around and kind of telling me stories about Canberra if you 're going to be speaking to the artists of Canberra about Wellington hmm what would you want to say vibrant and interesting and there 's a really broad range of I guess artistic experiences that one can have there I went to the theatre a few times you know I went to lots of galleries and things we went to a few openings and there 's sort of a really rich cultural kind of history it 's a very vibrant place reviewer speak to the ants of Wellington about Canberra what would you want to say um Kemper is like a very small and welcoming community also one of the great things that I 've been thinking a lot about is that the ANU University has amazing resources so for all kinds of different projects Canberra is a really great place to come well thanks for both of you congratulations on being part of that this what comes next for each of you thank you thank you _"

response we should be building communities not another prison justice reinvestment is that idea that we invest in our communities up front to reduce crime reduce recidivism and ultimately make our community safer it costs a lot of money to keep people in prison about 300 a day in the acct that works out to be a hundred and sixteen thousand dollars for one person over a year but you also know 75 percent of detainees have been in prison before here in the AC t we have a small population we have a justice population that has high and complex needs so it 's really important that for justice reinvestment to work that it is targeted to the particular and local needs here in the AC t this means prison should be a last resort and justice reinvestment solutions must build on data as the infrastructure the kind of data linkage that 's needed to make sure that we our interventions but also the rigor in evaluating those things that we do because we want to be responsive we want to make sure that what we 're doing works and as a consequence ensuring that the justice reinvestment strategy has larger and long-term impacts in 2014 the AC T committed to the justice reinvestment strategy it aims to support people who were in or at risk of coming in to the justice system we 've decided to bring together all the different people who helped to make the AC t justice reinvestment approach come to life it 's been a four-year project and it 's been a really important project so that government has worked in partnership with community academia and those with lived experience of the justice system to develop an approach for the AC T that 's been developed by AC T people the high-density housing program at Ainsley Avenue is one of these initiatives it 's structured an informal programs linked residents to activities and other services that build communities and reduce crime so we run a range of program to suit residents as different burying we run a skills-based program here when it 's needed for residents we also run a workshop program at the other sites they 've got small community rooms and we utilize those community rooms to what we described as a community chat there 's no one solution to stop people from entering the criminal justice system or even to help them remain in the community once they have left prison but we do know working together is key that 's why the government partnered with the acct Council of social service to run a co.design_``_173.59 process we had around 80 people attended those workshops that were a mix of people who had been in the criminal justice system people who were lawyers or academics interested in criminology and in legal system reform we had people who worked in services that are not legal services but support people involved in the legal system we had lawyers and we had police and we had government policymakers who could all come together and imagine a new way forward based on a shared understanding of the data a shared understanding of the critical issues a justice reinvestment strategy and could come together and form some shared priorities for a way forward justice reinvestment in Australia focuses on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the acct indigenous people are 16 times more likely to be incarcerated than non-indigenous people we have the highest rate in Australia the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community can already see the benefits of justice reinvestment that 's the end goal is for people to be supported our people Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to be supported in the community and to have you know strong safe families have better life outcomes and that 's the dream one particular trial called Yara Bieber Mir works with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to improve life outcomes and prevent or delay contact with the justice system families are at the centre of its support model we know though we know from the way our families are behaving and reacting and engaging we know that they 're doing great you know we 're doing good things here yarrabee Pamir is not a wolf for walk tall and that 's how this program it began in 2017 a joint initiative between the government and local Aboriginal organizations including the wananga Numa teacher Aboriginal health and community services the aboriginal legal service and million more are at the acct women 's legal service so when I go to visit the yarrabee for me women in AMC then needs a complex their needs are not just about legal they 're about re-entering the community back into Western society their needs are about Centrelink housing supported accommodation legal needs it 's about you feeling safe feeling supported being around people that they trust and that 's a really important role that we play in this community this program will er Maura it makes a huge difference to the families that work we work with since we 've had the justice reinvestment program we 've been able to provide the intensive support that we need to provide to the families that are part of the program in a small jurisdiction there are many opportunities to partner with the community and see the results of justice reinvestment overall when it comes to our justice system we are seeing every jurisdiction has a significantly growing population of people who are incarcerated here in the AC t we want to turn that around we want to see that growth in prison numbers stop and ideally actually reduce that 's a big goal and one that I think a lot of people would say is have been impossible to achieve but we are determined to do our best to do it pursuing justice reinvestment produces great social outcomes makes our city safer and keeps people out of our criminal justice

    "text": "welcome to the arts funding information session my name is Jenny Speer and I 'm the program manager of the key arts organizations at arts ICT in this session we will give you a brief overview of the new arts activities funding and the application process including information about making your application as competitive as possible a broad range of arts activities can be supported including but not limited to the creation or commissioning of a new arts project or artwork the production or public presentation of new artworks or events professional or skills development a residency or mentoring opportunity that is significant to the development of an arts practice the revival or reinterpretation of his existing material noting that arts activities funding has a focus on the creation of new work so while funding may be sought for the revival or reinterpretation of existing work the application does need to clearly show how this is addressing the funding aims which I will outline later and it 's also important to note that screen and film based activities are not funded through arts ICT and any inquiries about that sort new arts activity funding is meeting community requests by providing increased flexibility more responsive time frames certainty around opening closing and announcement dates consistent criteria for all arts activity funding the increase to maximum available funding also the fact that feedback can be immediately sourced and applications can be resubmitted so you can get feedback from art so city staff and then reapply the key features so the new US activity funding has two streams there 's requests for funding from 500 up to 5,000 and then requests for funding from over 5,000 and up to 50,000 which will open twice a year with fixed opening closing and announcement dates so funding for small projects and activities up to 5,000 is open all year and applicants are notified of the outcome within six weeks applications can be made at any time however must be submitted at least six weeks before the start date of the activity and to allow for a quick turnaround applications will be assessed by arts ICT staff successful projects activities should be completed within six months of the date at which the funding is granted but this is needed for large projects activities from 5,000 up to 50,000 there will be two rounds each year applications will be assessed by an external panel of Assessors and applicants will be notified of the outcome within three months of applying these activities projects should be completed within twelve months but up to 24 months two years can be requested we 're required and there will be fixed opening closing and announcement dates across the years so there are now fewer restrictions on eligible activities and an increased cap on funding requests and a focus on the creation of new work also you are now able to include a video pitch to support written responses to the assessment questions so remember it is the information not the quality of the video that is important here so who can apply individual artists who live in Canberra or his practice is clearly based in Canberra groups where the majority of the members have a Canberra based practice in such cases this group will need to nominate one person to take legal and financial responsibility for any funding or the awesomest horse be based in Canberra so bear in mind that applicants who do not reside in Canberra must specifically and strongly demonstrate that their practice is based in Canberra and generally this would only apply to people living in the immediate Canberra region and if you want more information on that it 's available on the arts ICT website you cannot apply if you have any unaccredited undie from the ACCC government however you can apply if you have funding that is not yet you to be acquitted applying for funding for requests from 500 up to 5,000 applications for funding are now open and can be made at any time however applications must be submitted at least six weeks before the activity start date you may submit one application at a time and receive funding once each calendar year if you apply for funding and are unsuccessful you may seek feedback from arts ICT staff and reapply for the same or a different activity you can apply in this category up to three times a year and can also apply to the five 250 thousand dollar project category for a activity so with requests for a larger project so over 5,000 and up to 50,000 this opens twice a year with fixed opening closing and announcement dates so the current round opens on the 1st of June and applications will close on the 31st of July funding will be announced by the 31st of October and you can start your activity by the 1st of December the next round of funding will open on the 1st of December and applications will close on the 28th of February funding will be announced by the 31st of May 2019 and you can start from the 1st of July 2019 you can submit one application per round and can only receive funding in this category once each calendar year however you may be part of more than one application for example you can apply for your own activity and be a paid artist or a member of a group or of an organization submitting another application if you apply for funding and are unsuccessful you may reapply in the next round for the same or a different activity and we encourage you to apply to the up to 5,000 project category for a different activity or another stage of your 5 to 50 thousand dollar project arts development supports new and exciting ideas and supports artists to develop their skills and practice arts participation and access engages the community as active participants in artistic skills development in inclusive and accessible arts activities that reflect the diversity of the community and arts opportunities its assists artists and organizations to reach new audiences and markets artists and organizations to connect nationally and internationally including through residences and cultural exchange and assists work to be showcased to national and international audiences so now what I 'm going to do is hand you over to Anne and Anne is going to talk some more about the intricacies of the new funding so now that you 've worked out whether or not you 're eligible to to apply and hopefully have some idea of the sort of activity that you 're interested in now we come to writing your application and this is true for both the under 5,000 and the over 5,000 and just I mean it that we get each year where we 're simply not able to fund the application or even truly assess the application because there are some fairly straightforward things that aren 't included so using plain English this is not the time to use the sort of academic language that you might have needed at university keep it clear remember that whoever is reading your application assessing your application probably doesn 't know anything about you or your arts practice and may have very limited knowledge about your art form the under 5,000 applications will be assessed within arts a CT and we all have differing backgrounds the larger applications will be assessed by a panel of Assessors but it may have people from art forms which are not your own so if there are terms that people might not understand explain them and generally try and keep the the content fairly easy to understand use the word limit that doesn 't mean if it says that there 's 400 words you don 't need to use exactly 400 but we do always have some applications where they 've sort of very unlikely that you 'll be able to explain your project in one sentence so use your word limit think about all the information that the panel might want to understand your application share your enthusiasm with your successors and that really just means make your project look exciting you 're presumably excited about it try and share some of that passion with the Assessors without forgetting about the using the plain language but just remember that this is something that you want the Assessors to be excited about quality support material we 'll talk more about support material later but give us the best support material you can we understand that sometimes it might be a work in progress if you 're asking for a to record music you may only have something that 's been recorded in your bedroom so far that 's fine but just make sure that it 's the best that you 've got available this one 's really important ask somebody else to read your application even if you 've applied and been successful in a number of occasions somebody else will be able quite understand that or what did you really mean by this so if you can finish your application a few days before it 's actually due ask somebody to read it you 'll find that that will will help you can also ask arts ICT for information about applying but we are not able to read specific applications okay these are the questions that you 'll be asked to answer what is the activity how does your activity meet one or more of the funding aims how will the activity be delivered fairly straightforward there 's no trick questions we 're not going to ask you for huge amount of analysis but we do need each of those answered clearly so what is your activity what are you going to do all also to a certain extent why are you going to do it why is this an important activity for my arts practice now what is it about this activity that is special that I really want to do funding aims Jenny went through those earlier so address one or more of the funding aims you don 't need any community outreach outcomes don 't address that so just choose the ones that are most appropriate have a look at the dot points underneath them think your way through the questions how will your activity but be delivered who 's going to be involved where are you going to do it when are you going to do it how long is it going to take what else do I need to be involved to make this project happen you 're welcome to include if it 's a more complex project include a separate timeline include a list of other participants so think again what are all of the things that the panel is going to need to understand my project and to be confident that I can do my project so part of that how will this be delivered is why are the people that are involved in the project the right people do they have skills that I don 't have are they other people that I need to collaborate with why are they the right people to collaborate with if you 're going if you 're exhibiting for this Pride it once you 've answered those three questions these are the next two most important things deliberately haven 't gone through a detailed budget now but our handbook which is online does actually give an example of a sample bubble budget the most important things there about a budget is that it needs to be clear we need to understand what 's going on and it needs to be balanced my suggestion with your budget is you 'll be asked for an income statement and an expenditure statement start with the expenditure what are all the costs associated with this project your income statement then simply says well how am I going to get this money together I 'm going to ask for some of it from art say CT maybe I 've got some other grant maybe I 'm going to provide some of the money myself maybe I 'm going to provide some of it in kind so be very clear and setting out this is my expenditure this is my income in terms of in-kind support you are most welcome to include that and but if you 're going to include in-kind support it needs to be included in both the income and the expenditure if you are going to include your own time again it needs to be included in both if it is a project where you 're actually asking for a very small amount of money but your in-kind support is really large you may choose not to include that actually in your budget sheet because it may make your budget unnecessarily complicated there 's a space below the budget for any explanation and you please feel free to put your time commitment there so that Assessors are aware of how much time you 're putting into the project but it 's not necessarily something you need to include in your budget sheets the other sorts of information that it 's useful to include below your budget particularly in terms of payment of artists how have you arrived at those those fees that you 're paying other people how have you arrived at the cost of the venue or anything else so that will just give you a further explanation of yourself and any other key people involved in the project you must include quotes for any major expenditure items and you must include a confirmation from anybody else or any other facilities that are involved so if you 're going to exhibit at a particular exhibition space you need confirmation that that 's going ahead if somebody 's going to work with you you 'll need confirmation that they 're available recent high-quality art forms support material is almost always required there 'd be a few kinds of applications where you might not include that just provide the best that you can make sure that it 's relevant as far as possible make sure it 's recent the most important thing about the support material is that if the panel doesn 't know who you are they can read your application but it 's often when they actually see the support material or listen to it but they start to understand you as an artist so they can look at your visual artwork they can read your writing they can hear your music and they will actually start to understand them to assess the application but also starts to understand you as a person and think okay I can see I really would like to see that musician go ahead so it 's very difficult to get funded without adequate support material you can also include if it 's a large project then you need to marketing plan detailed timeline accessibility and if it 's a community arts project additional confirmation letters often get asked about letters of support if it 's a big project and you want to include one or two letters of support from other people that you 've worked with and things that 's fine but they 're not critical what is far more critical is that the people are actually going to be involved in the project put letters so don 't don 't run around and think oh I 'll just got a letter from here there and everywhere unless it 's directly relevant to the project it 's probably not helpful having said that there are a lot of things you do need to include a support material I would also ask you our particularly on the larger panels our panels are busy they 've got to read a lot of applications if you 've bombarded them with a whole lot of secondary material that 's not particularly important they may miss the really important items we 're very happy to provide advice on what support material to provide if you 're not sure you can give us a call so as we 've said the intern the up to 5,000 applications will be assessed in-house buyouts ICT staff each application will be looked at by a minimum of two and usually three staff members for the 5,000 to 50,000 category they will be looked at by a panel of outside Assessors from a variety of art forms sort of things the panel will be looking for or arts ECT stuff how is the activity interesting different or important really what that means is is this something new for the applicant is this something that is really important for their career development is it something that the community is really interested in being involved in benefit how does it meet one of the that you have planned this project that you know that you can achieve it that you 've actually thought through all the aspects of the project and does everybody that is involved in it have the necessary experience to bring that to fruition very quickly the general procedures are we 'll run a quick eligibility check make sure that your na CT based artist that the timeframes are correct that sort of thing it 'll be assessed by peers the peers will then rank all of the applications by art form and they will make a recommendation as to the funding the funding recommendations will then go to the minister in the case of the 5,000 to 50,000 the minister will make that funding decision people will then be notified of whether or not they 've been successful and they 'll be able to receive feedback you can receive feedback whether you 've been successful or not if you 've not been successful you can receive feedback you can then immediately turn around and apply in the next major round or it 's under 5,000 application you can reapply again the under 5,000 to for three times in the year if you 've not been successful by that time we probably need to work with you a little bit more or you might need to go away and have another think about exactly how your what it is that you want to do or how you 're portraying this _"

happened so um Suzanne Suzanne 's going to speak to the premiums I 'll get a microphone for uses in Susan sorry not Suzanne I wasn 't in on this group so I 'm just going to read verbatim opportunity to reduce premiums increase the cost benefits in return for the trade-offs also that no-fault is cheaper under a statutory system of benefits because it means quicker treatment rehab and a pay-as-you-go wages then there was a question underneath obviously from another group which says how is this conclusion reached facts we need them and removal of in inflationary triggers then someone probably a third group in biro said because you cut out lawyers and administration lovely thank you round of applause Susan stepped into that extent of benefits what we started off with option to seek compensation via benefits table or common law legislative and benefits table and body on for you or yeah best for you then we had comments down here no fault do we need to distinguish extent of benefit if person is culpable eg illegal act contributed to accident then we the last one is we need to establish what is minor injuries and what is not benefits can be determined by an actuary under statutory rule in inverted commas general and economic without layers not about crime in at fault in brackets everyone deserves cover and final one removal of at fault and changing to universal cover will not unlikely to increase premiums limit thank you round of applause to housekeeping things one we are back on air the live stream on air pink thing is there to let us know that that 's happening and number two you 'll remit is up here and it 's up here because we 've taken the screen up so that 's just so it 's there so you can keep seeing it and keep being reminded of what it is you 're here to do over your time together so what do we hear about who should Amelia who should be covered in white our group came up with a possible model could combine no-fault statutory tables rules for minor or common outcomes combined with optional access to common law processes with possible limits on at fault parties claims this added examine increased access overall then other groups added remove common laws statute base so based everyone including at fault drivers consider limiting general damages ie pain or suffering for those at fault everyone has immediate access to initial or ask payment for medical expenses ongoing access no limited damages and education of public thank you Amelia that 's what 's going around I heard a number of different groups saying what I 'm starting to hear as we move around as we went through this question process with our speakers as we 're going through this process now is we 're getting to a point where it is that this choice or is it this choice and that came up a few times around what we 're hearing in here so starting to get towards consensus even though we 've got we have tensions to resolve hearing from people talking about seeing potential pathways forward not being able to describe what they are and what 's in and what 's out but seeing options starting to come out navigating the system how to best determine claims who is this thanks John [Music] we do need the sorry the the identified and then other folks identified the no fault approach a simple identification of minor claims threshold for claims above minor a simplified system where injured people are empowered a simple process to identify your medical economic loss remove lawyers from some claim processes and replace with social workers who better target needs of people and tailor the process to be more friendly increased capability of gatekeepers eg GPS possible independent complaints mediation process and oh no three that 's that 's our notes thank you John round of applause and to all of you deeper deeper deeper you go we 're gonna leave these tensions here there 's tensions that start to come for you in here you leave in your thinking they 're not on the wall we need to hear them we need to afternoon share them with each other share them with us share your information gaps through what you 've heard you might know and I heard um I was speaking with someone during that process saying I 've got to write out an information gap card from our session with the speakers I 've got to make sure someone on our table did that so if you have requests for information please do get them up there these are our tensions your tensions what you 're struggling with there 's probably more we 're gonna leave them there for now that might be uncomfortable heighten the sense in which you feel those tensions if you 're thinking this is all we 're getting up there that 's what 's you 're grappling with this is what you 're dealing with but you need to know a little bit more who do you need to hear that from what is it you need to know you 're about to decide mm-hmm good cue the Emily thanks Ted um okay so um as Chad said you 've started to go you 've had information and hopefully that 's starting to clarify some things for you or it 's raising new questions as we said to you our big part of our day together on I keep saying next week but it 's not is it silly CAFTA and on day three is the witnesses and who we asked to come into the room to work with us okay so what we are might be in the wrong spot for the speaker am i no I 'm okay yeah you can hear me okay yep all right um so what I need you to do now as Chad said we 're leaving those tensions we 're coming back to it so the rest of the afternoon we 're actually gonna start exploring the objectives and come back to those tensions but really came for you to grab that data do we need this did that just come down why I don 't think we need that yet later too efficient um okay so what you need now is glorious witness list and hopefully checklist if you still got it remember we gave you two had people 's names on it Judy I see yours there it 's there your checklist ha ha you went straight past it um and your witness list all right has everybody got a witness list please say yes because we 've got there 's only one left which says Emily on it you haven 't got one okay Heather can you couple up with someone okay if someone 's got a second there might be a second one in some of these odds and socks bags if anyone 's got a second one okay front page front page and a recap of what Emma told you yesterday the srg have organized for themes for you to work on it those themes are on Ashley Paige to theme I 'm sorry they 're on the top of the weaknesses so its theme one is what are the key trade-offs those weaknesses Andrew Estill Marcia David and Peter are all coming right guaranteed you don 't need to choose any one for theme one that 's that umbrella thing what we do need to choose is witnesses for theme two three covered theme three is what benefits are people covered for and theme for is fairness in claims determination so that 's the way the srg has organized it to try and make it easy for you granted that all this stuff comes together doesn 't it in the scheme it actually and that 's what the tensions that you 're exploring is that all of these things we 've got to actually weigh them all up together so in a minute what we 're going to ask you to do and I 'll give you you can have as much time as you need to read through the list again we 're going to give you six red dots which we 're going to ask you to spend in the week on the witness wall which is on the other side of the glass and when you go and you 'll see all those other bits of paper on the other side of the glass you might not have ventured around there yet they are all your witnesses and there 's someone Chad could you just take someone 's name what 's out there doesn 't matter any old one each witness out there has a single page with their name on it the numbers match up to the numbers in your document and they also match up to the checklist oh there 's Suzy happens to be Suzy right theme for number 27 is Suzy Walford you getting the system if you want Suzy to come and speak to bingo it sounded like that didn 't it if you want seesee to come and speak to you and she 's in your top six put a dot on this page there has her name right couldn 't be simpler Chad I 'm gonna give this back to you because I think Suzy needs to go back onto the wall so the way that this is going to work so we 're asking you of that list of 31 there 's now 32 I 'm gonna come to Fred in a minute because fred has nominated an extra witness and I want you guys to hear why he 's nominated that person 32 witnesses you need to choose your top yesterday about choosing a rainbow because these witnesses come from multiple sources on the srj different views expertise knowledge perspectives lenses and what we 'd like you to do is to choose a rainbow so if each individual chooses a rainbow hopefully we 'll have a rainbow of witnesses coming to speak with us okay generally that 's the process you 've got a question like you 're choosing six across all three things you choose them how do you like you could put six witnesses aren 't six dots on one witness but that wouldn 't be choosing a rainbow yeah but really at the end of the day of are you okay there are no rules what we want you to do is spread across those themes whatever jobs hey my boots are gone yeah I had a blister yeah I 've gone all into sneaker land yeah sorry I 'll bring the boots back a couple of weeks when the police isn 't healed okay so yes so you across all four themes time I need to take a message from my team across all four themes for you first money 's done for you I feel for themes yes you can put all six dots on one yep choose a rainbow it 's up to you but you 're not choosing from the first group yes that 's been done for you yes that 's right why the stakeholder reference group yes and you just gave me the dots but I 'm gonna give them back to you if that 's okay because what we 'd like you to do it 's actually a really nifty venue for this is follow Chad 's gonna demonstrate for us when you 've chosen your self I 'm not gonna put a dog down he 's not gonna put a dot so he will part he 'll be standing at the door he 'll pass you you dots there you go you get you dot and you come check off he 's he 's got a prop now in luggage come work we get these dots Mike walks into the witness gallery and as he walks through he 's thinking he 's putting his darts this is cute isn okay you done sorry scene two is as you walk through from this direction it 's two three four yes they are so that happens a couple of times and they appear in different themes because they can speak to different themes yeah yeah yep yep and the other thing to remind you about is on your witness list this is all explained on the front so you can have ten minutes to read it the people highlighted in yellow the people that Peter and Jeff have Peter or Jeff sorry Peter or Jeff have said would be good to hear from you some of them are the same people that you 've heard from today okay all right so fred has nominated a witness where 's my handheld mic we 'll run that to Fred are you so that 's the only witness that has been added to the wall we asked you yesterday someone you wanted to nominate to come and see one of us and add that person so Chad would you like to interview Fred about why

we 've got with each witness is a description about why they would be good and what they can speak to does anyone got any questions about Kate she has been put into theme for she 's number 32 handily enough she was down there so we just out of there at the end she 's not and you 'll see her name there Joanne she 's no color because she 's been nominated by a juror it 's handwritten there 's a handwritten sheet cuz I did it last night they asked me the nominate so we can ask him between times they have to ask him so if you think that Katie someone that you want spend one of your red dots on her okay if you think that 's useful so are there any questions about the process just remember and partly one of the things that I will put to you is and get you to think about as you choose your six is what would give the people out their confidence that you are significantly across this issue give them confidence that you 've done your job diligently as a jury so this is your chance to to curate who comes in who spends time with you who works with you as you deliberate I 'm going to sit down the just the other reminder that MO made yesterday about the purple and the blue are slightly similar colors in some spots the printings not pits that nuance up so as you choose your rainbows just be aware of that when you 're ready to choose your witnesses Chad is ready to hand you your dot you can file through you can have I forgotten something yeah ah I thought I did so well ah but then but then just more on your phone you know days oh there we go so you don 't have information about Kate in here because he was identify she was identified by Fred so but wait you might need to know of course is something about Kate in addition to what Fred 's told you so she is on the motoring Services Board of the NRMA which is not the same Services Board but they don 't have anything to do with the CTP system so it 's important to note that all right ok I didn 't forget that cuz I didn 't know that ok so we 're you ready I usually check oh thanks Emma when you 're ready I love you too use your checklist to mark your sixes your bridle over it talk to each other when you 're ready for your dots go through and get yourself a couple rings ok all right so do we have everybody back I think we do all right well done tick to you the next thing that happens in this process is that Emma 's going to go out there and count the numbers of dots on the pages but we would like a scrutiny from the jury one member from the jury and one from the srg to go out there with him up and make sure she can count who would like to be a scrutineer damn Gore and an srj member place oh can we have someone else someone else Fiona drop the meeting nice so we 've got Fionna and Amer out there they 're going to count the dots we 're going to come back to you with the results which is very exciting and what we 're looking for what we 're putting together is a panel of the top four witnesses in each theme so as Emma explained to you yesterday those four witnesses in each theme if we need to get hit the phone 's tomorrow maybe after morning tea time so we can have a sleeping hit the phones say see if they 're willing to come if they can 't or they 're not willing we will ask them to nominate someone who 's their best proxy so that you will either get the person you chose or a person as close to that person as you chose yes yeah if there is no best proxy that 's a good question hasn 't happened before my instinct is we 'd go to the next one on the list but we 're trying to give you the package of people that can speak to that wheel will probably go that 's okay or we can do what you like which is to maybe go to that next person on the list what do you think next person on the list okay so if that proxy can 't get the person so whoever can 't turn up we asked them for their proxy they can 't find one we go to the next one okay all right deal done I saw nods comfortable good know the dots the next one and the dots yes the dots yes not numerically no no no no okay um so while that 's happening very interesting Jeff 's out there with his calculator trying to count we wanted to get you thinking a bit more it 's not knock off time and as we send you on this task you 'll get to have some morning tea maybe whatever what is it afternoon you know 35 there 's actually printed ones yeah okay I just feel like I 've been here all day um okay so the next question that we 've got for you and we did have it on the screen and it down is imagine if the Chief Minister walked in right now if the Chief Minister walked in right now and he said to you what 's the most important objective of this scheme what would you say when we say objective that means what are we aiming for what 's the most important thing that the scheme is aiming for we 've already had a couple of goes at this question and as I said we work through things a few times so that we can sort it out as you 're thinking develops coming around is a template from our friends at mosaic lab that that they use which is nice so I don 't have to reprint and it 's pretty well pretty simple just need to replace the words it would be great if the scheme aimed for and write your answer in that box now before you start writing before you start writing before you start writing do not write under the dotted line and you sorry the rest of the room is going to be reading your writing so please try and make it in the afternoon before coffee just try and be as descriptive as you can and write as clearly as you can it would be great if the scheme aimed to aimed to do look okay the objectives we 're working on the objective once you have done that put everything down except your beard apart bring a pen and a paper and join me over there where everyone 's standing up we 're moving over there one objective one your most important one your most important one one objective what would you say to the chief if he walked in right now which he won 't because he 's somewhere overseas one no and one am i clear one the rest of the room will have the ends right trust each other I know only that you 'll cover it you 'll cover the bases okay so you need a Indian sitting out for this because she 's scrutineering which we 're comfortable with she 's comfortable with sitting out on this yep when you 're done you need a pin in your hand and your piece of paper and into the open space on the back of this board are your speakers that you 've requested we go on source will tell you who they are we 're gonna hear from Karen she 's got some words for us and then we 're gonna close so there are four things reminder livestream on air we 're back on soap correct hello out there I was on the other side of that light yesterday so there are people watching multiple times during the day sure you go on during the breaks we can talk about that afterwards tensions so we had our six groups I chose letters instead of numbers because it 's more number one to sound good for political correctness we could change a sorry not a F to the whiteboard marker because we don 't want that to look like a fail and call it G but we 're not like that so we can just keep it as f tensions let 's start here you work through your worksheet with these we asked you to go in to these tensions you have to explore around navigating extent of benefits and the premiums when you just spoke about what you spoke about then he didn 't give you this lens you spoke about whatever you chose to spoke about you might have brought this in you might not have brought it in Emily 's going to try and capture some of what we hear from each of these so if no need for a legal process who was in that group so you can see if you you can stay where you are you know you come out the front yeah we 're just the tensions that last we just read them before the other day yeah is this necessary some people thought a change is needed and some people see no need for change specific to our question of a legal process basically does the insurer claim process is that easily navigated by people today or do we need an independent third-party insurance third-party system or going through the insurance process okay well right question of clarification is this necessary what is this like through everything what does this mean yeah easy an in-depth independent literature literature required for thank you David quick segue information you need from witnesses or others info cards reminder there 's things you still want to know get that down paper over there blue tack stick them up we 'll do what we can thank you are we okay yes are we doing I 'm just checking are we doing their cross-checking yeah that 's about navigating the system so if you see in an N when Emily 's recording it 's going to relate to this some are like to multiple some might relate to none additional tensions that have come up within that 's it across will help these make sense to you next time it 's really just capturing it so that we can track it base can hey wrap it in early you need a microphone I put it over yeah tension around rapid and early is the long-term illnesses so we don 't want to premature settlement change that we want to bypass the legal system from rapid medical payments okay so what I 've written down I just want check I 've written down long but yes at the same time we don 't want that to disadvantage us and say further down the track locations that we hadn 't thought of so you don 't want rapid access to exclude the possibility of later on that 's saying that again I 've written one immediate support no let 's move it I 'll say what you said Chad want to grant access we want rapid access that does not exclude the potential of future claims thank you Jorah moving up no-fault under a statutory system oh did we won 't thinking we weren 't except around extent of benefits or is it a couple of them navigating the system so we 're using navigating a sea and in so tell me what they are um navigating an extensive benefits NC I 'm hearing CC yep okay we had Ombudsman for mediation no-fault under a statutory system even-numbered sent for mediation attention yes yep yep we actually started going for a combined system so which will make sense of a cap for pay and loss a second tension yes yeah cap for pay and loss injuries after which one can resort to common law a cut-off point being a time point or monetary yond which one can resort to common law and before you give that back to me I think it 's navigating the system who should be covered and why probably the extent of benefits and what 's fair and reasonable okay it is what 's all the others yeah the extent of benefits thank you being available to everyone see if we got John John provided some better music for his group as a musical interlude and all I had sorry about that the Italian in me doesn 't control yourself what we said was by expanding coverage to all people it is reasonable to expect an increase in the cost of the scheme seeing as we meet all the time and that has an impact on other objectives where savings are being made tensions mm felt that whenever said sorry the impact so that again so the impact comment again has an impact and my impact on other objectives where savings are being made you might save to pay okay and relate to Old Faithful Oh C and a and premiums and premiums is it all of them he 's at navigating the system not really okay thank you John okay good ha we will be collecting they so if you haven 't handed them up we 'll come we will come and get them be best outcomes for individuals evidence-base thank you grab that aim Vanessa welcome it is and it 's writing dancing okay so we had most of our attention it said Radner yeah revolved around defining terminology really so the first one of the first tension was returning to as close as possible to your former pre-accident state to a reasonable standard but then this possible versus reasonable is difficult to define satisfactorily in practical terms when it comes to rehabilitation in particular and also is best possible affordable with our current premiums probably not but it was a we see that as attention returning to as close as possible to format priests pre-accident state to a reasonable standard the tension being best possible or unreasonable is that it yes and we had a couple of examples don 't have I don 't have those that people wanted to share them here but it was it was it came down to you know the insurance company said this this will do this is a decorative item to cover up a fault yeah but it wasn 't usable so the best practice would have been to use a device that was usable rather than just decorative you know and I believe it was the NDIS in the u.s. that claim to the rescue but so that was that was the example of reasonable recursive best practice no tractor tality of delivering reasonable and best practice yes and does that have implication around premiums was that where you were well lead to that because three of our points were based on their so best possible versus reasonable is is difficult to define which then led to the question is best possible affordable with the current premiums I don 't know the answer to that I 'm not the actuary and the only other one we had was a capping based on income so for example should Bill Gates example and Microsoft insurance doesn 't cover him and he 's in his you know he 's a passenger in a terrible accident and you know he has to be flown back to the US for treatment blah blah blah blah just he get all that on his income whereas you know later down the road single-parent on a pension those things because she doesn 't have a good lawyer to tell us she should ask for them so therefore do you cap based on income capping based on income hmm okay I think it 's sort of contentious it to me it 's around who should be covered and why it 's the dollar extent isn 't it Bill Gates bill Gators are who yes yeah so wealthy income very wealthy versus not it probably is who it 's probably in of premiums you talked about premiums to their closest one to Chad the know so much about navigating this is no I don 't think it 's got anything to do it there okay good okay I didn 't grab that as well but I 'll make sense of you tomato Thank You Vanessa I 'm gonna put Emma on notice you 'll be coming up in five minutes or so I make losses as they occur welcome back today so you want tensions so we sort of rope form but it 's the dot form is money is paid early and then we 've got slash possible cost of money slash devaluation over time so the discussion was really around try when you 're trying to pay early the insurers will be paying more money earlier than they would have in a system where they you know drag the system drags on for a few years or whatever and the the cost of the money that they pay out is actually higher earlier that make sense the next one was the da pointers lump sum remains for pain and suffering so the the tension is if you 're paying people early on for their economic losses and costs and stuff like that and then they also get a payout where we can feel that there would be some people who don 't like there 's sort of two that I 'm saying thumbs up I 'm saying nods and before you disappear map which ones does it really it 's definitely extent and navigation of the system we didn 't delve into then what effect that would have on premiums but okay good job Vanessa tell us okay and does it come under why or who who should be covered and why anything else it 's right we 've got it covered under premium the extent that whole cluster I can put it in there that 's great yeah good yeah okay thanks Chad so the reason that we wanted to grab those well unless you wanted to is so that we we keep coming back to these these tensions and these trade-offs and as we keep coming back to them you keep getting sharper and sharper about what they are which is really really good so as Chad said what we did beforehand is we we got you to think about each of these you know individual way now we 're interested in looking across about how do we resolve some of the tensions between these things is going to be as a jury on day three and day four in terms of this data we 're going to keep it as it is wasn 't planning to type it up I can take some photos and put them on Basecamp so you can just have them kind of better sometimes to have it spatially instead of in a document so we can do that before we pull them down this evening but we 'll put them back up again next time we 're together so you 'd still be there and we 'll continue to work on it and just a question that I overheard some he was in asking about the objectives again we 're coming back to those those objectives that we did with the 35s activity and started to work through that little worksheet we 're gonna come back to those probably a couple more times that 's the main bit of your job is to get them right so don 't be worried I 've got I 've safely stapled all of those other things together we 're going to be pulling anything that 's really important yes the other ones the other ones that we didn 't work on so they 're all safe with me okay so it brings us to the witness program and as Emma makes her way over to talk about us talk about this the other thing that I want to say is that as of tonight the information we need war is closed so if there 's anything still on your mind about information that we need before you go please jot it down and stick it over there on that wall just because we 're going to use that to brief these witnesses and there 's also some info that we can provide for you might be able to get for you the srg might be able to put together to get for you answers to specific questions okay all right we 'll get this mic right one day now firstly to tell you the process we went through for doing this Dion Fiona where my observers checking that what everything I counted was correct and making sure that the order of everything I no mistakes made so what we did is we took each theme one at a time off the wall and I counted through the dots and then they watched me counting and chanted along with me and then I circled I put a circle with the number in it and you can look at all of those if you can look at them if you want to check mine in ranchipur quadruple check my counting that fine on top of what they did and you know we 'll bring them and leave them here and we 'd put them in their reference folder so you can see all the votes anyway so who did that result in us getting a drumroll you probably I 've already seen it um so as you know theme one I was selected for you from the srg and so you got that sorted theme two we have David Gifford my Cleburne Kamal Franklin and Jamie Ronald theme three we have Ian Cameron Fiona Tito Wheatland Laura Neal and Estelle Pearson and the votes are there and then theme for we have Ian Cameron Andrew couple of issues you might see here we 've got Ian Cameron twice and we had a tie with Kate and Medellin so how I 'm proposing sorry Geoff from so John Walsh so yes Ian works yeah yeah so what I 'm gonna do with in with your okay is I 'm going to ask in which one of these he wants to present in which one he thinks he 's best and with the conversations have already had within I just can 't quite remember off the top of my head which one he said he thought it 'd be best we all asked him and for the one that he thinks he 's not best I 'll ask him to give a colleague or a person that he thinks his next best able to speak to that topic and to speak on his behalf you comfortable with that is that fair he was a pretty high voted person so the next best person to speak on his behalf in the other theme is that a room on your list well well the next best person on your Kate on Madeline because I just then leave it at those two but we 'll expand it to five if we need to on that group so what 's the can you live with that approach sure yeah probably coming at the same time so there 's a practical issues a practical issue otherwise I would I would I 'd let him speak on both if he could do that but he can 't Louise I think the opportunity is to hear from right around your people and I 'd rather in theme for hear from both Kate Lundy in metal inhibit hmm sorry people I think what the ways is proposing is that we go with John Andrew resent on theme three are people who doesn 't whose we can 't live with that are you working you 'll hear two of the three yes yes yeah so you hear all hear theme one so you 'll all here you 're all here theme one you 'll then be in two of the three and for the one you haven 't_''_3101.599 we have a third process which is hearing what they learnt so yep yep so you 'll you 'll get an insight into the one that you 're really good inside hopefully into the one that you haven 't been in yeah yep all right question so you go to the ones that you feel like your mouth need to know information on down is that down asking question I just want to go the other way in relation to the like to still have a medical person in that theme fourth so because that 's what eenz background is that was a thing that was brought up yesterday that we didn 't have a lot of knowledge on the medical side of things in relation to this that we had the lawyers the insurers but we didn 't have any views from the medical so even if we had a replacement for it if inches three say and he 's just another replacement for the medical side of things even for to take his spot hate love me and Medellin is still going to be there so we 're gonna have five in that green sorry the of the more important in the fairness and claim determination question than they are in what benefits are people covered for I 'm not saying whether it 's important one or the other which is more I 'm just thinking my GP would get like so many questions from me in relation to or hear what 's going on in relation to the claim process or that the thing for one so I actually think that the medical to say how much they actually hear about from their patients and clients I 'm just running things up him right up the our space yeah I mean just reading again the little blurb about him here and can talk about rehabilitation and recovery after injury including what helps them what does not for that section as opposed to what they said in the last section you can talk about yeah rehabilitation and recovery after indices so is that more relevant in fairness in claims or what benefits of their covered for I don 't know I 'm not saying not to have a lien three I just I mean I reckon makes it more sense because he was so popular across the board it 's pretty much at the group in both then the one that he chooses then the other one he can might have someone that he feels would be able to the questions he 's been the medical side has been something that 's being brought up it 's also shown there that half the group once that in those two categories so I 'm not saying taking anyone away it 's just that that group will have it both and medical perspective both people and move in there all right so you as and the rest before because we 're not going to cut someone out just because they 'll be talking about different things in these times they 're not going to be the same information in those things so is Pitt everyone happy I think with what Dion 's might like it you all can you live with it I have I 'd see Enys we 'll keep talking about this but if you all can live with this that having a health person here by ian on his who can speak on his behalf then that 's what I 'll do if we have if we have to have five year wheel so if we have to have five in this one I 'll go with five because of the tie it will might be that either Kate or Kate can 't make it I want to talk to Kate yeah one could make it yeah it might be that any one of them can 't make it but we haven 't had any communication with Kate yet because she 's been added so it might be that Kate can 't make it in which case I 'd go with the four yes sorry yeah I 'm concerned that the only two insurance companies here in the city and closer and I 'm sorry yeah and only one representative of one of the companies gets chosen I would that but then of course and secondly the need for a representative for an insurer to be one of the witnesses I can 't change you vote now like that was you vote so I can explained thank you very much Jeff tell you what an insurance company person would probably say in group number two David Gifford worked for a government insurer for the transport Accident Commission there 's probably not quite the same but again adequately briefed he may be able to contribute that kind of viewpoint does that solve your issue it is what it is yes what it is yep it is what it is yep and and you 've heard them both today yep so you have them both with you today and both of them are yeah they know you 've done accidentally they 've been here watching and I think cirrhosis is still here from one of those insurance companies and indeed the one that wasn 't selected no crying sorrows you 'd probably be busy having a baby psoriasis okay so he 's all right you 're all right okay so that 's your list as so that deals with Ian and I 've dealt with Kate and Madeline and how we 're going to deal with those so good work I think it 's a good job numbers we can lock square away that process so we 'll let you know what that is and we 'll e-mail you this we 'll put this up on Basecamp as it is so you know what you did and we will also once we 've got everyone ticked and locked away to come in will tell you who they are okay and there may be name differences we 'll make sure if people for example if and says I want you to have Fred Bloggs we 'll make sure that we get enough information about Fred that we can another buyer I might my wifey yep it 's just me and it 's standing here and you can 't hear it okay good well done ah time I let me have a look let me see what I can do it 's it 's a it 's a toss-up between hearing two of the three and being able to go deeper as opposed to being able to hear all three to be you know more shallower level so let me try let me play with it and try and them we 'd have to record them all because you listened if you ever think about it and and see we 'll be audio suffice look if we recorded them via audio we can do we 're going to audio record for all of them yeah in fact in fact you guys can audio record them for us so we can give you iPads to do the recording and then you can upload them to Basecamp yeah yeah yeah and the tech we 've we 've actually got iPads that are directly linked to Basecamp that load it up straight away so we can do that um yeah so you can hear the Malden MA M 417 yep 417 I kind of you know does it you really Karen ah so what we 've talked about it briefly and when I mentioned to DM when I mentioned it into the jury yesterday too was about the claimants there 'll be another process for the claimants as well we talked about that briefly yesterday yeah so how we run that we 're not sure on yet we 're still working with their needs are and what we 're doing is responding to what claimants needs are in terms of presentation so what works for them because it can be a very sensitive issue for some obviously so we can 't tell you more about that now but we will when we come back next week and we 'll have a plan that 's what we 're talking select look what the question was from the ways was do they need an option of being a record it so that they don 't have to sit in front of a jury and the answer that is maybe yes but where 's working that through so our base proposition is we want to do no harm to anybody and so someone suffering as a consequence what they 've gone through we don 't want to exacerbate that okay Thank You Emma are you Jewish daughters carinii we 're done Karen you 're coming back to us I 've said a quick housekeeping sort of thing ABC radio has a couple of jurors might be available to have a chat Genevieve Jacobs on the studio so I was wondering any jurors with yellow dots would like to see me at the end if you 're interested and available to be able to do that they usually like to have you in studio 40 so in about nine and where will you be at the end of the day for us to find you I 'll be and also if anyone has reflection that they 'd like to give at the end of the day Lara in my team would love to have a chat you 'll know if you 've you 've already had a chat but if you know just any thought to those so you 'd like to see Lara give us a wave Lara and anyone else we 've yellow dots that doesn 't mind leaving depending on who 's available for Monday mornings but if you don 't mind leaving your number with me if I do if we do get any media requests during the week to talk to jurors if you 're in just being a first name and number yeah that 's right and I would just thanks thank you okay Emily before you go yes Emma 's got one more thing to say I had to have the last word no I Emily will have the last word away yeah yeah um so some jurors I 've raised with some about evaluation we will be sending you out an evaluation form after the next weekend so you can tell us what you 're thinking in the meantime feedback to us as a start-stop key okay so I just wanted to make sure that was clear Thank You ml now I came here today I wasn 't here yesterday can you even remember what you did yesterday morning when you first came in here if you look around the room there 's a whole lot of stuff we 've taken down started to circulate to get ready to photograph to put up on Basecamp for you to access you can see behind this wasn 't here this morning you spoke about but your behavior how you want it to be with each other when you do what it is you do hopefully you wanted those today and you got challenged your master plan when I came in we 've had some pretty colors but we didn 't have this DS help 8 you 've gone in deeper you 've heard you 've winning those six rounds of that speed dialogue 15 minutes with each of those speakers and one with a break or most of the time actually with Jeff so you 've done a lot you 've come a long way there 's still a journey to go on before I 'm the Chief Minister receives your report sorry before the SOG receives sorry about that in a fortnight so we 're going to be back here in a fortnight doing similar things you are going to hear from more people we 're going to be working hard to cruise to recruit those witnesses that you 've put forward your tensions or words that remain unresolved some of them might be resolved through the information you hear and the conversations you have you 're going to need to bear that out there 's going to be a lot more time for you and your work in it is that you need to put forward to that stakeholder reference group between now and I 'm gonna hand over to Emily soon between now and when we see you again next I 've said Basecamp I 'm going to say base camp and I 'll say it one more time base camp there 'll be more and more and more that continues to be out of there in terms of what you 've created over the weekend how we go with selecting those witnesses please if you do have those questions around the information from the witnesses just there let us know so we can sort of source that in hand those requests out when it comes to the process things you want us to keep doing stop doing and start doing that wall is further on the way out do you remember to see Karen and Lara if that 's of your choosing what else do I need to do Emily I think that 's about it if there anything that that we 're letting you know about on Basecamp in you or not on Basecamp we go we might just get a sense of how everyone 's feeling yes you want to do that that 's what I wanted to finish I wanted to finish with a team hug _"

    "text": "well thanks very much and thanks for turning out on a such a cold well I suppose it 's just ordinary for you guys isn 't it but look I thought I might just sort of for the sake of anyone who isn 't clear about my background help help you understand how I come to be involved in something like this I was asked to be part of a team working out of the Children 's Hospital laughter Wednesday in 1993 and what was clear to us was that actually nobody really had much idea on what the psychological effects of disasters are or what we really need to do for people though there are a small number of people who are traumatized or have a mental health crisis but actually most people don 't_:_68.549 but it 's very clear that their lives were very disrupted and so I got interested in this and the various other things happened over the next few years in Victoria and as a result I was asked to take a role as a consultant to the recovery plan there and so that means way or another and this has given me lots of different opportunities to meet with people talk to communities in my clinical practice I often get referrals I 'm currently working with a man who evacuated from Black Saturday and was fairly traumatized and he and his wife actually their house was so damaged they bought another house and after living there for two years they couldn 't really bear to stay there because it was too close to the fire so they 've actually moved and bought another house or built another house in another area all together but they just can 't settle and now they 're starting to drive around and look at other places they might want to live and they find it 's beautiful place they think that what will it be like in the summer so they 're still really not settled and this illustrates that we need to understand the timeframe in experiences of this sort for some people their circumstances allow them to accept the situation and move on quickly but other people don 't and it 's only when you sit who they are what their background is that you can really understand why they can do it the timeframe they do what we do know is in the long term if people take care of themselves and track themselves through the process they can do well in the end and so that there will come a time when people look back so these various experiences give me these different perspectives and there are so many different events your event is a very different event like I was in Christchurch about three weeks ago spending a week there and you know there are still people living in what they call munted houses that apparently in New Zealand work for completely destroyed and messy and you know they 've still have yet to wait until the repairs are done so that 's a particular sort of stress but I thought what I 'd like to do is share with you some of the things that I 've come to understand about the things we take for granted the whole point about disasters is they come in and they strip back the fabric having the fire or the flood or whatever but suddenly there 's information that strips back the fabric of your life and changes the meaning of everything in some ways that 's more challenging than having a physical event I won 't say it 's either is preferable actually I noticed that everybody wishes they had somebody else 's disaster until they have that one and then they 'd prefer to have the other one it 's like dude would you rather have a migraine or an abscess tooth you know it 's sort of we always think about the thing that we haven 't got but but but there 's a particular character to an event that has got my physical sort of starting point I think it 's in a way a particular challenge to come to grips with it we 've had a contamination scare we had a we had a housing estate built on a an old rubbish tip and suddenly they found it was leaking so much methane that the Fire Brigades thought the hot place might blow up any minute so there was quite not quite the same but a similar sort of disruption but but I guess what I 've come to understand is that this exposes what we took for granted now here 's the point we don 't know what we take for granted because we take it for granted don 't we we don 't know what our assumptions are about life because they 're assumed actually if you really go into it the nervous system our nervous system cannot retain an awareness of something that doesn 't change and so as soon as we get into a routine and a pattern the all of the things related to those routines and patents fade about out of our awareness and leave our mind free to deal with what 's changing like what will we have for dinner tonight so you isn 't it annoying when they move the supermarket shelves around and you 've got to stop and think where where are they are these things now and instead of actually sort of preparing the dinner in your mind on the way home you know people will say how exhausting kitchen and to do that three or four times in a row after you 've had your house burned down now I think these things combined to demand our attention to the trivia of our physical life they did a survey it must have been one of my earlier trips last year to Christchurch they did a wellbeing survey in Christchurch and one of the key stresses that came up with the roads now their roads are shocking there you know like this there 's no point repairing them because it 's still being moving recently and they 're digging everything up you know and they dig great holes in the road and the pipes have disappeared without trace so they have to relay the pipes and they bring in new witch 's hats every night they change the roads so you have no idea whether it take you ten minutes or three quarters an hour to get to work in the morning and the roads are like this so then somebody asks me from the media why is that so important and I said well you know actually if know how long it is you can use all of that time for planning your day or think about what happened yesterday or you know that 's I call that mulling time mulling it 's like digesting processing and we don 't know we 're doing it because we just do it in the back of our mind while we 're doing these routine things things that don 't require attention but if you lose mulling time then you don 't actually process your experience and then you start to get very disoriented now part of this fabric of assumptions is the way we establish a stable life and one of the first things we do is we start to make an attachment to our place you know in Aboriginal culture and indigenous cultures generally there 's a very clear philosophy about the attachment to place you know and we all know how important that is in Aboriginal culture well I actually think it 's psychologically the same for not it not the same but it 's similar for us but we have no language to talk about it we talk about the pain of watching the land died during a drought you realize it 's more than just economics and I think if if you think about the process of you might be able to remember it at this moment you know what it 's like to actually decide to move and to slowly disengage and find a house you like and actually get very excited about and start to imagine it and think about it and visualize how you 're going to live in it and get really interested in and slowly sort of let go and slowly engage in the sort of a Danann disappointment you make the transition there 's a little bit of a flurry about oh well this is really nice there but I can 't wait to move in this is this is a natural process of the transition of your emotional attachments and these run very deep in our mind and I want to talk a bit about what 's going on deep down in their minds which we don 't need to worry about but deep down in our minds outside one system is organized around let 's call it the wish what I want what I desire what I hope for what has emotional significance and satisfaction for me and the other system is organized around let 's call it the thing reality the harsh reality of what we can and can 't_''_637.61 do I don 't have enough money for this I wish I could run fast enough to get in the Olympic Games but I can 't I 'll just watch it you know whatever now starting off in childhood there 's just the wish there 's no so they have tantrums they want ice creams just before dinner they just wandered and slowly if everything goes well we gradually educate them to put more focus on the thing a reality which means we where she learned to overcome our wishes or planned slowly and lots of money too so we can buy the thing we want instead of just going blowing our credit cards you know we 've become responsible now when anything happens we have this sort of this this question between the thing and the one this it takes a long time to really accept it and that acceptance gradually has to penetrate deeper and deeper layers of our existence and it 's a slow and painful process because as soon as you accept that at one level there 's a deeper level that has more to do with habits and expectations and assumptions where the wish is still dominant in other words I want my loved one to come home at five o 'clock at night and so I find myself expecting it when I 'm not actually thinking about it you know what when I think about I know that 's not going to happen and it 's painful and I accept it but there are times when I 'm you know in the middle of doing something my mind sort of distracted and I I find myself experienced so the wish is still there so we gradually it takes there 's no way to shortcut that because those expectations and assumptions are built up by the repeated experiences of the same thing over time time after time after time and that 's fabric of secure predictable reality that if we have any kind of choice in our life we reconcile with our wishes right so you buy the house you like well you like that within the range of what you can afford in the place where you need it and so on and so forth so we make all sorts of compromises and then we end up with this house and then we live in it and live it and live in it and the house gradually as we make that emotion once investment ceases to be an object it becomes the medium you know the medium so we don 't think I really love my house we think I love to bring you home and have dinner with me in my house or do things in that you know I mean it does become a an object when you think we need to paint the walls and so on but but it fades into the background together with all the history and life that 's lived there and what was it like before you heard about mr. fluffy you know now all this fabric of assumptions routines etc has a very important function in that it actually it should combine the thing in the wish and it 's stable and we can assume it and therefore it gives us security right now as soon as that is disrupted security is damaged and what you get is the release of uncertainty which releases what we call anxiety now anxiety is just the diffuse activation of emotional kind of readiness and at one extreme it can be absolute fear you know I 'm sure there would be people here which if I said I saw a mouse running around under the chairs here somewhere there probably be a few people who would start getting anxious I didn 't_''_909.24 I didn 't but but people would get anxious you know is that right it 's all right I don 't like them and so that 's that 's the fear but at the other end anxiety is just activation and readiness and preparedness you know I can 't settle I can 't concentrate on what this guy 's saying because you know I so on so the spectrum of ways in which anxiety Manifest but it 's triggered initially by a loss of security and that will come once we have uncertainty and we didn 't realize that that was held in place by our routines and assumptions and expectations now this therefore leads me to the idea that in disasters and I 'm going to call this a disaster because it belongs to that sort of area we have three major problems just to simplify we have the trauma that is the encounter with a destructive agent like the man I mentioned who gets injured and nearly dies but I 've managed to escape that so that 's the trauma aspect I guess in your case it 's the it 's the threat of the destructiveness of the of the asbestos is is that you know it 's the equivalent to that and it 's so silent sort of it 's not like a fire you can 't pinpoint the second one is grief now grief is the response to loss and while we think about that often in relation to people loss of neighbors loss of course the house that we 've got an emotional attachment wherever we make an emotional investment attachment connection that we then rely on as part of our fabric of expectations and assumptions and security we are going to experience grief when we lose it because that the grief is the pain I think grief and the way I think about grief and I work with people is it 's as though we 've lost a part of ourselves now of course it 's not the same part of yourself when you lose your house as opposed to when you lose a family member but it 's still a part of yourself and it still hurts so wherever this loss there will be grief there should be grief because grief is the way in which we come to grips with and accept loss as the thing the problem is when we stay in the wish I don 't want it to I don 't accept it I you know I can 't_''_1092.48 I can 't accept it I can 't move on but when I keep accepted it I 'm not standing to build an alternative reality I we say we go into protest when I don 't like the you know three-year-old who wants lollies at the checkout and you say no you can 't have it what do they do any self-respecting three-year-old they 'll throw a tantrum one day I 'm just talking about my kids well-adjusted psychologists kids right so so that 's the protest I can 't get what I want I you know so what 's better is that they cry for a little while and pull themselves together and actually in the course of that they realize mum won 't always give me what I want that 's a pretty good message to get but when we get home you know she 'll be nice to me and read me a story so that you know they start to actually realize that life is not just about getting what you want it 's about something much more complicated so that grief is what helps us release the tension and accept but our culture 's not very good at grief like pain so it 's hard isn 't it it 's that process of back and forth but the third problem is disruption and I think often when you look at people who have had a serious trauma or being involved in disasters you 've got the trauma and the grief but often what they 'll say is the the event itself was bad enough but I can accept that life serves us up just terrible things that happen but what really was difficult to accept or may life terrible was what happened during the recovery period all of that disruption but they 'll sometimes call that the second disaster and if you don 't have authorities that actually are sensitive and plan around that experience then of course a lot of the things that the authorities do actually make things worse and I can see a lot of people nodding the problem is the authorities can never actually get it right but you know I think well I 'm not here to apologize for the authorities but you know I think that you 've got people that are trying and I could tell you all sorts of ways in which it could have been much worse but we won 't go into that but this disruption element I think is very important because that 's the period where people are losing that fabric of routines and expectations and assumptions and then moving into this conflict between the thing and the wish I don 't want it you know it 's talking to some people earlier just before the meeting and I was asking about how long did it take to accept it and it takes a while doesn 't it to accept what the situation is and then to actually think I 've got to make a decision and you know and then the emotional process of making the decision is quite different from the intellectual process of weighing up the pros and cons and you 'll oscillate between those that 's moving between the the wish and the thing isn 't it and you know we 're all different and we some well some women would say this is typical male that just do the logic and say men would say this would be like women were all emotion and I can never let go because this has got to allow my memories in my history and you know actually we 're all somewhere in with those two points of view and we and so one of the things we need to recognize is that this process of working through the disruption is going to tax all sorts of things that you probably didn 't realize it 's going to text relationships because no two people are going to do it the same pace and in the same way through this process and I think what becomes to my mind crucial in any process of now with us is like a recovery process you 've gotta lose your house so the recovery process how do you get settled into a new life and what does that involve and how long does that take that 's a recovery process so that the question is how do you look after yourself so that you can get through that recovery process without losing things that you didn 't realize you were to actually make sure we don 't just focus on the tangible issues of you know making the decision buying the house while doing whatever whatever it is you decide to do we 've got to actually look at how do we preserve the whole fabric of our lives the quality of life the relationships while we do this how do we preserve our connection with our children what they 've been finding in in Christchurch is similar to what was found in some of the Black Saturday areas and that is that around about the four year mark you 've got a bunch of children who are born in the year of the disaster who are just starting to come into the educational system and they are not ready that they are quite immature because the parents have not been able to create the sort of security and and often parents get priam mentally and emotionally Parata we 're all working with our thing and which aren 't we so we it 's like trying to find out where where they put the sausages in the supermarket you know if you lose you 're mulling time you also lose that a capacity to simply attend and to be interested not only kids but let 's say partners you know we 've we have to be we have to be interested in each other don 't_''_1482.34 we and what will happen is you get this I call it degraded quality of life as people are sort of preoccupied and they if we 're not careful we don 't keep communicating we 'll go into our own space and we 'll be pursuing your own agenda or our own timeframe which doesn 't fit with other family members and one of the problems is going to be that a lot of the people we 've used to support us in the past who aren 't associated mr. fluffy are not going to get it do notice that they don 't get it no reason they don 't get it is because what you 're struggling with is in this era of assumptions and we don 't know what our assumptions are they don 't know that their assumptions are intact and disrupted but they can just see you send you carrying on an awful lot for a long time and you should just get on with them you know well let it be the crudest or they 'll give you lots of well-meaning advice which doesn 't do it you know so so you get this this isolation what I would advise I 'm not suggesting this will solve the problem so what I would advise is you actually give detailed descriptions of what this is doing to the nuts and bolts of your life so that they can start to get how complicated it is I 'm not sure how that would be in your case but it might be that I 'm having a lot of trouble concentrating or I 'm not sure whether I should do this because I don 't know where I 'm going to be you know or whatever it might be give them a capacity to don 't just give them your feelings give them the facts because the feelings they 'll say well you know I 'm sure you 've been much better on with them but that 's not you you you have to actually go through your process everyone has to go through their process and I think what 's really important from observation of people in natural disasters is and I know there are limitations because of the way governments have to set boundaries around things but I would say really respect your own timeframe for making your decisions if you can 't make a decision I think that 's either means you 're not ready or it probably means there 's something getting in the way of your ability to actually sort the priorities and that 's often I think a time when if you 're not already engaged you 're getting engaged with the support systems you know and maybe get someone to sit down and help you lay it out often you know that 's what we counsel it 's best do after disasters is actually help people take stop of this situation by maybe asking them some questions about what kind of aspects of their experience are they not really understanding or attending to and once people often will benefit from just even one or two sessions just to actually with someone who 's got the experience to help them just clarified so what I 'm really saying really is this that this period of time now I would say that 's from the the time you realize this something you 're going to have to do until you 're settled in a new life is this period of disruption so first of all you 're unwinding and unraveling and you know losing things and breaking them down and so forth and then you 'll start to build up but I think your life is only going to be running smoothly when you 've built your new routines in your new house and you will see how that 's going when even when you 're in the new house and you you 're doing something in routine and you finish it in the evening and then you head off home and then you suddenly realize you 're going to the old house you know that that means it 's not that you 're still on the enter old house you haven 't really accepted the new house and you know I think it 's important to to watch that and to understand that all of this is going to demand attention so a consequence of that is going to be attention means energy because you 're working with the deeper layers of your mind you 're working that requires physical energy and one of the consequences will be fatigue do you have it do you notice it 's tiring in ways that 's very hard to actually pinpoint I think it 's very real better just put a put my watch out here I 'll talk all evening because if we get a chance if I might talk about that but but but I wanted to just say so so when we work through this what we need to be aiming for is the time when you 're in a new house or whatever your arrangement is and you 're now once again oriented towards the future just as you were oriented towards the future before it happened now often our goals are implicit or assumed of disruption we can lose track of them now I set off from my house in the Arab Valley to drive up to Bendigo to give one of these stalks after like Saturday to the the fire affected people in Bendigo and I 'm driving along the Western Ring Road which goes goes around the north and side of the city and it 's going to go past the Hume Highway which would bring me up here and I 've got to go down and I 've got to go off the Calder Highway and just before the Calder highway does the tullamarine freeway goes to the airport so I 'm driving along nice sunny day thinking what am I going to talk about in Bendigo what have they been telling me about the community out there and then all of a sudden think oh my god where am I going where am I going am I going to the airport are we going to Bendigo that 's Bendigo that 's right oh I 'm on the wrong side of their freeway or better get across quickly and I 've I 'm going for the next hour and a half can 't_''_1894.09 I and I think that 's how our life goals are they really come into the foreground when we need to make an important decision and then they they 've given us our orientation they fade do we actually even know how to put into words what our life goals are I think often we don 't know I mean there are some people who are much more tidy and well organising me that write lists you know and put up 5-year plans they probably even look at their bank balance regularly but but you know a lot of us just actually you know will sort of well know what 's important to us and that will guide us but only in particular moments then it fades now if you put a period of disruption here where you 're deeply preoccupied with a very narrow range of things to do with houses then you actually lose track of all that stuff and if you you know have lots of anxious anxiety and worry and concern and and so and you 've lost track of what was important can you see how that might happen for no other reason than they you 've just been very preoccupied for a long time I can remember at a meeting in King Lake in about the fourth year after Black Saturday towards the end of this meeting in which we discussed a lot of the issues that people were struggling with people started to talk about the positive Saturn one young woman said that you know I 'm actually really enjoying living in my new house and I 'm really enjoying decorating it and expressing myself and so on and the other day I sat down and I thought now what were my goals for my life before the fire but I couldn 't remember she said wistfully now there 's a real concern that if you lose that track the the orientation that should form the foundation of your future as you start to consolidate your new life it doesn 't have those that focus I was at a conference last year when an American who had done a lot of the buzz words of the moment is that resilience he said one of the main features that characterizes resilient people is what he called a moral compass you know how the compass always points north so when you are out in the bush you always know where North is and that should help you work out where you are so a moral compasses I 've got a set of values that show me what 's important and where I should be headed and therefore when I have to make a decision I can say well that 's where I 'm headed so which of these two decisions going to take me nearest and and that helps us make decisions so if we lose that mulling time because that 's when we 're connecting everything up when we 're connecting it up at a deeper level if we lose that we start getting sidetracked into all this the detail of what 's going on and if we 're having trouble accepting the reality we were angry with frustrated we wish it was different and so on and therefore that kind of important not to put all that off until you are settle but she take timeout actually someone told me earlier how good it was to get away and have a holiday in the middle of this process many people have said that about bush fires and floods just get away and get with people who are just living their lives and you can just be normal for a little while I think it 's really important to do that and and to actually take care of the quality of your life during this period of disruption and to think that the the significant issue is to be looking further ahead than just the new house why do we want this house what do we want it to express how do I want my life to be organized within the range of possibilities I 've got which may mean let 's face it for some people these events will mean there will be a net loss you know you 'll end up with a house that 's not as good as the one you had or you don 't have the me there 's a lot of attempt to avoid that as best it can be but you know that might mean there 's a period where you make a transition and it might mean that some people will say as they did after bush fires and so on actually the old goals aren 't working for me anymore I 've got to actually review some of the important goals of my life well that 's creative we can have lots of lives and they can all be possibly creative but we have to actually let go of one and grasp another opportunity and to do that we need time to mull and reflect because that 's when we dip into those deeper layers and it means in relationships talking communicating and that 's why I would think it 's extremely beneficial even just to compare notes with each other in different ways so that you also learn from each other from how you deal with different issues you _"

    "text": "as business is a naturally occurring element it 's a rock and use in Australia extensively over the last 50 or 60 years we 're particularly have this issue in the AC T which is quite specific to the AC T and summon surrounding New South Wales regions of the Louisville asbestos and that 's what the the whole buyback program is about so asbestos is dangerous there are no safe levels of asbestos but there is a commonly held belief that every fibre of asbestos will kill you now that is not true and we have good evidence now from from multiple studies around the world that the more asbestos that you are exposed to the more likely you are to get a problem but it 's really quite massive doses over a prolonged period which have been most associated with the more severe effects such as mesothelioma yeah so in terms of the Louisville a specific in a house for for a long long period and the house was poorly maintained they would have a relatively higher risk but still extremely low people that are living in a and have have evidence that there are no fibers in the living areas would have extremely low risk of developing as business related disease people that have intermitted ly visited briefly even lower so is that scale which is very important to understand that it 's large exposure to large amounts of fibers of asbestos for a long period of time is dangerous but that danger decreases rapidly as the spider becomes shorter or less fibers being exposed to the risk is low even for the people that have been living in the midst of lovely houses we realized though that it 's not zero and as houses deteriorate over years then that that risk can increase and so the government has made that decision based on a range of reasons but including looking at a precautionary approach into the future and really that the best solution we 've come up with is to remove this problem once and for all and that 's why we 've gone down that line it 's important for the community to understand that asbestos is a naturally occurring element and it is around years in the construction industry for example it was previously used for brake pads it 's been used as a fire-retardant material in multiple ways in various occupations and particularly in defense so it 's all around us and in the urban environment all of us are exposed to asbestos in one way or another in small amounts having said that it 's is small amounts and so people need to understand that really it is what we know about asbestos exposure and disease is based really on very large exposures over a prolonged period of time so whilst we want to avoid this exposure to asbestos as much as we can the risks are extremely low actually in the acct if people are worried about their level of exposure they should see their local doctor and I 'd say there that people may be worried in other reasons around the whole mr. fluffy episode neighbors and so forth are going through a time of transition particularly people that have been leaving their houses and are currently live in their houses as the demolitions go forward that would be another will feel anxious upset even depressed and more serious mental distress and so I really encourage people to see their GP and the ICT government has put in place with the ICT Medicare local a range of extra supports for psychological distress at this time and so there 's certainly is there and I would encourage people to take advantage of that so for people that are concerned about their exposure and I would say that that 's really people that I 've been living in in mr. fluffy houses or people that have been working on mr. fluffy houses that they 're the ones that most at risk not really the neighbors not really people that have just been visiting from time to time but anyone who 's concerned about that risk can go to their GP and discuss their individual circumstances it 's it 's relatively easy for me to talk about the general issues in the acct I know the rates of mesothelioma they remain extremely low but individual circumstances can vary and I would encourage people to seek advice from their trusted medical advisor normally their been planned that that there will be very little asbestos that will leave the site of the demolition asbestos is a rock it doesn 't actually fly around very easily it is not dust and so even if there was asbestos fibers there it usually settles very quickly and very locally so the chances of those asbestos fibers going outside of the of the property of the demolition is extremely low the issue with the bun fiber is an interesting one so certainly asbestos is not a that there is no level of asbestos which is completely safe and but but really it 's the larger exposure to asbestos many many hundreds or millions of fibers is really the issue that here so everyone will breathe in asbestos during their lifetime anyone in an urban setting in Australia will breathe in asbestos in their lifetime every hour all of us are breathing in some asbestos in our lifetime and yet in in the acct less than 10 people will develop mesothelioma this year so it just doesn 't make sense to me that one fiber will definitely kill you when few of us are getting that disease the most important thing to understand now is that there 's two things that are going to happen around the the time of the demolition I think firstly the people who are living their houses are going to be upset about that and and I can really understand that people who have long associations with the houses where the kids have grown up and so forth this will be a a worrying time and that 's quite reasonable for people to feel psychological distress at that time anxiety jumping out of the sleep even depression and so I would really encourage people that I have been closely involved now or in the past with with mr. fluffy houses just if they 're feeling those things to recognize them in their own in their own self and to take advice from a trusted medical practitioner and the ICT government has put in many supports there in terms of mental health support and psychological support which are accessible and free so that would be there would be in one group the other group the other very best way of dealing with this problem in terms of it in terms of the demolitions the chances that any asbestos fibers will leave the actual properties is extremely low and even if it did the chances that that would lead to any illness in neighbors through this whole process even either the demolitions themselves or the transporting of that of that material to to its final destination is extremely low and I would really encourage people not to be worried about that so the ICT government will be releasing the list of the other mr. fluffy houses so soon and this may raise your anxiety for for people who suddenly realized for the first time that they 've actually been associated with the houses either having lived there having visited there or for trades people they may have worked on these houses unknowingly that 's the time when people should should take note of their own health and they could seek advice from their own GP about their particular circumstances again for people that have had only minor exposure to the houses we feel that the risk of exposures infrequent visiting for example is extremely low for the trades people I would hope that they 've used the usual precautionary measures but if they 're worried as you go through the usual process for the previous occupants then they definitely should consider about how long they stayed there and what sort of risk they may have been been in and to seek medical advice for that you _"

    "text": "thanks very much Kimberly and thanks for the opportunity to be here and to launch the event with you this morning I think I 'm trying to remember when I first heard I think it was a direct approach from you and from Tony to talk about opportunities that could come from having the centenary trail open and you know how we build up I guess participation along the centenary trail actually had the opportunity to launch the centenary trail back in must have been October I think of 2013 and it was at hall and I made a commitment that I would walk the trail at that point and i would get it done within a year and I 'm on track I did set myself a challenge of 11 stage per month and I 'm a little off that but I 'm up to this stage actually which is why you 're all here today at Stromlo because I was due to walk off up there and finish the stage 6 to tag along this afternoon but obviously events over the weekend have required me to change my the condolences for the curtain I 'll make sure that I pass them on to all his friends and colleagues that are grieving today but so apologies for the health year in the wind but this is I guess and you know just such a great thing for Canberra to have to have this centenary trail where we can walk I guess circumnavigate the acct in a sense and also access parts of the acct that we 've never been able to before particularly up on the the northern stage from Watson to Hall where you can go up to one tree hill which previously hasn 't been open to the public and I can say from experience don 't do it on a 38-degree day which is what I did that was there were some low moments there I can do it but it 's absolutely exquisite and I 'm also told at this stage along the murrumbidgee river is absolutely beautiful as well so we 're really excited we 're very happy to partner with early bird events and to support this in its inaugural year I hope we had the centenary child built that it was a legacy initiative from the centenary of cambrie year but that we would encourage people to get out and see the sights of camera be healthy and support all the work that organizations like the Hart Foundation do so I 'm very supportive of the Hart Foundation being the charity partner there are excellent partners in encouraging cam bearings to lead healthy lifestyles and their leadership in this area is second to none I would also say one of the great things about centenary trail for people who might not do a lot of walking is that making tracks who designed the trail and built the trail the bits that weren 't already existing trail did it in a way that it 's accessible for the vast majority of the trail there are a couple of bits along the way where it would be hard in a wheelchair to use the trail but the gradients have kept at a really decent level i can tell you i speak from experience if you want to go up the mountains you can but know if you have some limitation on your mobility and that was to make sure that people even though you don 't do trail running or have a lot of experience can actually use the trail and get around it really easily so it 's something a lot of people don 't know they might think that it 's out of their reach it 's definitely not although yeah 20 weather days on particular stages look from experience there but thank you it 's lovely to be here and have some focus on my day and I 'm really excited about this thank you to all the ambassadors that have come on and and going to help us promote it because that 's essential as well and i look forward to taking part i haven 't actually decided which one to do yet I did I 've done a 30k walk and I have to say I was pretty tired at the end of it so somewhere between 25 and 50 i think i think the hundreds out of my reach but I look forward to taking part in doing 100 challenge today thank you _"

    "text": "when you 're taking your metro you 're walking to and from so you 're interacting more with the environment around you with other people and so on you 're getting more exercise so I think a really big social benefit is the fact that you by necessity are getting out and walking a bit more I 've seen some statistics if you look at European cities that have good urban transit systems rail bus Ferry wherever it is they walk on average ten times more than people who are in motocross cities say in the u.s. in Australia their obesity problems are much less in fact you can actually track it all the way back to fewer health problems less demand on the health system so that 's another point I want to make is that by having a good transit system it helps to make a city more compact it reduces health problems takes pressure off the surrounding natural areas because there 's less pressure to put suburbs out much further and more attractiveness of living near the transit quarters and living near the transit nodes so there probably need to do a better job of quantifying those economic because they also have economic benefits _"

    "text": "good morning and thank you for the opportunity to talk today as David mentioned that the focus of my presentation will be our own innovative housing solutions for people with an intellectual disability so what I would like to try and cover is a quick overview of meander and our master plan of the project that we 've embarked upon over the last year for years the design philosophy that went behind that the accommodation choices that we 've developed and as they would mentioned that the consultation process we went through and then just finishing off on where a disability housing may end up on what it might look like in the future so Mendes are a not-for-profit organization we provide service and support to over 1700 people with an intellectual disability we 've got a mix of institutional accommodation and community-based accommodation so we have 250 people with 11 community-based accommodation and another 250 that live at our brain site which is a traditional institution we offer other services such as respite and aged care the option programs and supported employment so the organization as a whole employees employed through our supported employment programs this is just a quick overview of the site so this is the state i 'm going to focus on in the project that we 've developed over the last three or four years it 's a large site its twenty eight hectares as an institutional base their head offices are here and we have accommodation with the option programs or located in within this site and some of the challenge is obviously institutional accommodation and institutional settings I 'm sure you all know probably better than me the weaknesses of that and the average age of a residence is 55 so many of them have actually lived on the site for that period of time in the course can actions with that say and the area but at the same time we are not we had to plan not only for them but also for the future demographics we knew that within the next 5 10 15 years the demographics were going to change and it was going to probably change the more younger demographic we had the issue of housing stock in but also in our community based housing as well and the not fit for purpose that not fit for people with an intellectual disability they 're not fit for people with a physical disability and so that was across both portions of our stock we also had the challenges of access and suitability to private and public housing which there 's been a few equations so far and access is one in terms of obviously the availability of housing stock and access from another perspective in the local community area and access to public transport and access to amenities is another issue and and then access within the building itself saw the and I have to say that this is focus solely in South Australia and that the traditional residential build that isn 't fit for purpose or even if we wanted to go to the private stock it really wasn 't a solution and it ends similarly with the public housing it 's as the same issue we 've got eight houses that we rent from the South Australian house and trust that really don 't meet the needs sorry we don 't obtain any funding for capitol work so that was a huge challenge and other in previous discussions there 's been discussion around access to capital our challenge wasn 't so much access to capital it was more around how do we pay back the high levels of debt that we would need to incur in order to redevelop the site and especially based on an affordable ring to solutions of the payback period was really enormous and we are owned by an association of approximately 350 people and their mandate was to sell the site and so we had a range of issues to work through so from there we developed a range of gating principles that was really focused their own deinstitutionalization community integration and social inclusion how could we reverse the integration method community and we also applied some universal design principles in aging in place as well so we had other principles around assistive technology the asteroids spoke about and also financial sustainability how could we redevelop the site and cover the the risk associated with high levels of debt the vision that real high quality and integrated community that delivered on person-centered thinking and that was one of the other guiding principles that the organization had developed and before we started this project the organization had invested with five years and what the research into what 's the best model of support and person-centered thinking was the focus and that 's what we 've adopted but we 've also tried to implement that through the housing design as well our master plan really looked to reverse integrate so we looked at ways of bringing the community onto the site so we looked at and your normal residential stock and I on a rental market but again the payback period wasn 't suitable so we looked at em retirement accommodation that gives you the upfront capital but also a long-term recurrent revenue stream that we can use to to cover the course of development for our own accommodation but also then gives us the opportunity to reinvest then new and improve service and also additional accommodation and I also gave us the opportunity to try and integrate with the community and we were could open part of the site up to the public so we 've got a clear balance between private and public space so that people that level on this site I 've got the sense of privacy but also the opportunity to socialize and integrate with the community and designated areas so we have a wonderful wetland that 's really at the heart of the site and has linkages not wait to transport but also to the boardwalk as well the focus now is really just our own precinct planning and housing designs or because we retained ownership of the land we could actually manage the precinct design as well so pedestrian movement and vehicle movement we 've been able to reduce the speed to the 20 keys and over and we 've got pedestrian pathways that are set back from the road with landscape buffers with dedicated crossing points every 30 meters that link up with an integrated pedestrian pathway through the site and Andrea spoke about wayfinding and that 's been a key focus not only around the state but also in the buildings as well so using the rear end to say and also improved street lighting and si si te in the street as well just to give our staff and also the residents a bit more safety and everything is really underpin be safety for this this group they are so vulnerable and it was important that that was the key focus so we developed three different housing solutions we came up with a three and a four bedroom house and that was the starting point because it 's something that everyone in South Australia can relate to medium an identity accommodation is still in its infancy so we developed three and four-bedroom housing designs that really focus their own the orientation North and South loving areas facing north to tap into the the natural light bedrooms to the south with two shared bathrooms between the four bedrooms there are DDA compliant 3b access so that we can design for aging in place in the future that we 've stuff in the ceilings so that left in devices can be stole installed in the future to enable people to be moved from their bedroom to we call an exceptional needs house which as for people with really exceptional needs behavior support requirements and within this model it was really around a secure environment and some of the people that live in near our section 32 and in this model we had with any chose for independent living units of bed sets arrangements where they had their own private bathroom bedroom and bed set as well as a secure courtyard with common space in the middle as well so that staff can then support them through cooking cleaning etc and I guess that 's the basic fundamental of the project as well as with the institutional environment those basic life skills a lot of the individuals in fact most of them haven 't had the opportunity to learn around cooking cleaning was really basic needs we 've provided all those facilities within the dwellings to help build those skills and then the third option is apartment accommodation so one in two bedroom units yep that one there we knew that in the future and apartment accommodation is going to be the thing ministry NZ Australia ever provided one in two bedroom units and here but with a concierge support system to enable staff to support people and the daily life plans so we 've got left 's we 've got jumbo buttons in the left 's we 've got camera with your talk back in the left in case anyone gets stuck but in terms of wayfinding and each of the levels have a designated color let 's then connected with the left so that people can actually find the way to their own label an apartment some of the generic design features across all the properties was really first and foremost to provide a rage accommodation for our and a residence or going from the one in two bedroom units to the theme four bedroom house to the exceptional needs house they 're all six star energy rating and they 're all DDA compliant so all the bathrooms are DDA compliant they all face north south and not only for natural light but also for the passive ventilation as well if it 's all of that we 've got large windows and doors to really no steps and nor thresholds through all the properties so no steps into dwellings there 's no thresholds showers or balcony doors we 've got integrated drains just to provide a seamless finish now we 've got wide doors or name 20 white doors and white corridors with done in circles to support people with mobility issues or if they 're in a wheelchair one of the great things we were able to find out of Switzerland was a new floor covering and that 's called born it 's a woven vinyl so it moves away from sheet vinyl which is very clinical and institutional and looks just like carpet but has the benefits of of your traditional sheet vinyl it 's very expensive but makes the wailings look much more homely basic things around the possession of light switches and powerpoints or reduced height of light switches raised powerpoints door and window hardware and handles that have returns on them that are easily easy to grip and the window winders are the jumbo buttons so that people with arthritis or issues with our hands are easy to operate we the laundry as well and similar to what Astra did mentioned we didn 't call for the flexible bench tops but we have designed the joinery that it can be the carcass can be pulled out at it could top the sink and also the sink in the laundry we 've got an integrated fridge and generally the joinery as a whole can be locked if need be depending on the individuals behaviors or support requirements in the kitchen and there 's very few cupboards it 's all drawers for easy access there 's pullout pantries and we 've also got isolation points for power in the kitchen and it can isolate all the main appliances and similarly in the bathroom with water we 've also implemented some assistive technology as well and probably not to the extent of Astrid but really our own swipe card access into buildings because we know that the people we support can 't really operate with keys but it also enables us to track movement as well and we 've got an intercom system at the houses and the apartments that not only provide the corners of your support system as well we 've got motion detectors through all the bedrooms an apartment so that if we can so passively monitor people 's movement and we can set up support plans that see it for example of someone 's and shouldn 't be moving around at night and if they move into another area or a bedroom that they shouldn 't be able set off an alarm and it will go to a concierge system and staff can come and support them and we 've got reed switches and doors and we 've also got the talk back call points as well staff will be using the deck phones and iPhones and we unfortunately couldn 't get to the point of the individuals using iPhones just because the cognitive ability of residents to use use that type of software but we believe there 's a lot more innovative solutions around that assistive technology for people with an intellectual disability and we also looked at the remote environmental controls through our BMS or that we can manage so air conditioning power and water consultation was so we had a really robust governance and committee structure with our board with a committee a project control group various different working groups for residential properties retirement and lifestyle as well as a number of user groups that went underneath that and we when we engage the design team where we made it mandatory that they had to volunteer within a certain area of our business to really give them that sense of what what is like to live an environment like this with a disability in that I have to say is just such a great lesson lamb and we had a an EBD which is exploration by design workshop we are over 120 people attended not only internal stakeholders but also external stakeholders as well and it really helped frame some of those guiding principles for the site before we even started designing so it took about nine months before we actually put pen to paper on any designs and we use the self-advocacy group as well as part of our stakeholder group that really helped form some of those guiding principles as well and public consultation of the master plan that enabled the local community to get involved as well which was great future of disability housing I think one of the things I 've I believe is that affordable housing doesn 't equal disability hosen sure it needs to be a board affordable from a place point but the actual form and function of affordable housing doesn 't meet the needs and what we 've realized is that the spatial requirements that we need to support people a person with intellectual disabilities in some cases fifty to hundred percent greater than what you would find in your typical residential house so what comes with that is create our capital costs and also when you look at the DDA compliance what you to move towards non-standard componentry as we also you pay a premium for it so residential dwellings were really classified as a commercial developments or the square meter course the development increases as well so how do we how do we bridge that gap and how do we move toward fill community integration and I think the fundamental is having residential thought that can order to do that certainly in South Australia the BCA needs to change BCA supports DDA in commercial development but not in residential development so that 's a fundamental and it 's something that UK done probably 10-15 years ago was made DDA compliance mandatory in your residential dwelling so that there 's access from the street there 's access to the property the weight of doors all those can have benefits and the circulation space within bathrooms I think that has to happen so changes to the BCA streaming standards but also thinking around policy change in the planning environment so that if we have the common ground models just fantastic for affordable housing I think the same needs to be developed for people with an intellectual disability so that people are developing a subdivision or an apartment building that a certain percentage of that building stock has to be fit for purpose and it has to comply with the DDA requirements and then that way we are spreading the suitability of accommodation through the community I think we need some clear design guidelines for disability housing and when not just they wouldn 't believe that probably is there are some of stewing standard around adaptability but really disability and certainly intellectual disability there 's there 's nothing there so I think there 's an opportunity for the sector as a whole to come together and and really develop a set of guidelines that can support new developers and new organizations when they enabled to develop a disability friendly accommodation and we need to look at innovative ways of construction to reduce the cost of construction to make it more palatable for organizations like ourselves but also for the private real estate market as well to actually afford to build these types of accommodation and how do you bridge the gap between an affordable rent and are really expensive cost to develop and as an opportunity for an n R as equivalent scheme to help bridge that gap and we were fortunate to have n rise in our stage 1 which is helped hasn 't made to feel way but it certainly helped so I think there has to be some thinking around that certainly to encourage the private that 's that 's me you _"

    "text": "good evening everyone I 'll start by making just a few broad comments without the context SIA will then go through a basic analysis of the site and then what I will do is give you three options than how the site can develop or disguise just in terms of the overall context and everyone is very much aware of this camera has been growing very fast in the last ten years and it 's likely that if that population increases we 're going to be another ninety thousand new dwellings in the next 20 years or something like that the only other place i know that 's been growing as fast as Canberra I don 't think it 's worth it 's in fact the other territory it 's done so it 's the two territories in Australia that are growing incredibly fast and one of the strategies are for dealing with that increase in growth is to have development down transport corridors and hence the policies of the light rail and increasing the density down those corridors now I know you as a community understand all that and this blotter land is because as densities increase you want to make sure there 's sufficient land for community facilities the site is incredibly well located next to the dixie group centre and what we end up doing with it at this stage where there is a lot of growth happening is critical so the decisions we make now are very important and doing nothing is probably a bad so we just don 't next one just in terms of the just so everyone understands the current zoning of the site is what 's called CZ six which is leisure and accommodation and the things that we have on the site at the moment but community centers tennis courts char care facilities have a hotel on the side of the moment and the things that we could go on the site caravan parks clubs indoor entertainment centers in our large indoor entertainment center could be put there in the future public transport facilities shops restaurants all these things of the mythical and and one of the issues to me is that if if one does nothing then what can happen i want to put an entertainment facility there and there is really it 's allowable and there 's no forward planning for that sort of thing I 'd better to have a plan so we 'll come to that in a minute so seer is this going to go through just remind you about the qualities good qualities and bad qualities of the site and then I 'll talk about options for the development of the side it 's just can everyone hear me actually so following the last workshop we were trying to ascertain from there what you as the public appreciated about this site and sort of areas that you thought it could be enhanced and by doing so it sort of began with the life process for one day and I so as part of that design process and starting this sort of to tell the story of the site it 's important that we go out on the side and walk around it and get an appreciation ourselves and what it did is actually reiterate to us a lot of your concerns that were raised at of them you know we saw as opportunities to enhance like further we look at other options and taking them to the next level of detail so the site as you know has two main pedestrian links at the moment which occurred like 12 the southern side and in one side of the drain and there 's nothing in between there 's no other way of crossing that drain so being mindful of the connection issue that you will all that was sort of something which stood out to me by walking past like through the side that it was imperative to sort of maybe introduce mother leak somewhere through the side so by walking through here you have to when you cross the drain at this point and you walk along the side you 've got the beautiful design which is under the trees and the psychopath which is currently completely exposed to the Sun that runs parallel to it there is a point here that sort of intercepts and connects back into the suburb and at this point when you come out of the path from the suburb when you sort of continue down this area here the back fence is it 's interesting because you sort of get some open vistas into yards and some are quite in close it 's quite sort of mixed probably the casual sort of surveillance doesn 't occur as much because it is people 's backyards as a person their front yard so they 're not always intrigued you know like we 'd cut vehicles and back and forth so and then likewise down here you 've got Peyton Place and that 's a beautiful avenue that sort of starts from this point goes up to Mount Ainslie and the rest of here they 're the focuses on 15 hotel structure over here so we be an opportunity because this is where you should commence a wonderful scent of existing your collapse there and that satellite and that experience of walking through the canopy on shea parallel so but yeah they wash like a good little child screaming like that 's all different layers and levels because of this job changing the new clips along here and then you sort of the new boss previous slide and choice is quite some stone here so technically you should me into that area but it was important to give a presentation of the whole area and is the future of gaming that space as part of a potential like public government wretchedly slave has a really great career or avenue of plane trees but again when you look down to this sort of finale of suffering oaks which sort of obstructs the view and that visual connection back to the drain so that may be sort of opportunity of course it 's very loaded sort of area of unmaintained land here and in the clients here a lot of the roots have become exposed so I 'm not sure physically how healthy they are and how long they will last as a result of that because there are a lot of stress and that again into the fire line and the main it occurs back into decent shopping center my people have actually wander through the car over in front of the swimming pool entrance or that seemed to be the main part out there and then around riverside here you can get a sort of unmaintained view back to the to the site where there 's no scene there 's no rhyme or reason it 's sort of quite ad hoc in its character they 're sort of graffiti to the reward they expose bus stop here with no shelter it 's hard to determine where that entrance are two rows of you is so to wanted to encourage that use of the community it would be hard to actually work out where that polite workers and likewise with the collection that have brought it there was across the road there 's a part that comes from downor onto anti street and again at terminates at the median and when you look across it 's actually just looking straight into the Salvation Army site so all connection back that way so i suppose in summary like I could see sort of a lot of your issues that sort of came up with the connection connection the maintenance of the landscape sort of being required and the casual surveillance the lack of lighting site and you know like it was actually quite scary to sort of walk among mr. can 't feel the need for some of the connections back into the suburb Dixon shopping center to the sub fields and beyond to down as well and also sort of looking so down here it was nice sort of sense of design nice dancer or anything on that Street skate so I suppose it was a case of seeing the opportunities that arise with your connections with maintaining your landscape getting a sort of bed of public domain or something really sort of thinking area here like that could be utilized by the tennis club as well as community that you might your space because connection sure so where there 's that sense of avenue here there was sort of we felt that there may be an opportunity to again bring in as like public area looking casual sort of meeting place here likewise here and also combining potentially bringing in a hook a more structured for carpet meander through the space okay so given that site analysis see everyone you 've been we believe there 's three or run you believe and see oblivious three so now the nice Rodney just to take us through those three drawn approaches thanks for those see it 's done a lot of work on the site and on these things amount of all things there 's lots of images of the sighting and comics and so and so forth so seamlessly yea indeed we 'll start we 'll start with doing that interest these drawings a little bit hard to understand why solid agree this is no spear street through here this is the community center it 's the hall we 're sitting in this hall here this is the art center what 's a call done anchor anchor this is the child care center this is the dance building last time we 're out here the dance building is quite low I 'm notice about three stories high now it 's developed a lot in the last few weeks the hotel here and Kingdom all over there just as a real truism it 's a sort of a first off thought looking at this two parts the first part is the part around Rose vs 3 which is really quite pleasant _"

    "text": "thank you for the lovely introduction and thank you all for coming and I 'm very happy to be here I don 't often come to Canberra and I 've been in Australia I 'm sort of out in Australia three or four times every year but Canberra isn 't often on the agenda so it 's a pleasure to be here I 'm going to tell you a bit about who we are and what we 're doing and how we work in some of the projects that we 've been working on and hopefully that can save some for some inspiration here and I 'm not going to show you some many glorious examples of how light will go through City but it 's more about the totality of cities on how everything works in concert and works together so so it 's more about city quality but I 'm always going to tell you just a little bit I talked about the starting point and why these Danish people all the way down in Australia and why how come that makes any sense at all so it in 1960s it 's a good modernist coming out doing some good concrete buildings for people to live in and then he married a psychologist who asked why are you out sex not interested in people and that kind of twisted this mind in terms of how what is the relationship between people and physical form so how how does the design of buildings influence cities of streetscapes how can you create environments where we enjoy being how can we create environments where we don 't enjoy being and how can we also take more care of climate issues when we do buildings and so that we start to to create buildings that actually fit the setting Marian this led off to a long academic career at the architecture school in coming and also writing a number of books and the latest one cities for people and the first one life between buildings and all of these books have been translated into 25 languages which I think talks about the whole that kind of need that kind of compassionate understanding of the need for understanding how we actually work in for us very interesting in terms of how the ideas have just been embraced and how there 's this eagerness in terms of of trying to do a little bit better yeah so that has led to the office we 've been around for 15 years with based in Copenhagen these are some of them 40 passionate employees have just opened in March in the US as well and so another 12 in San Francisco in New York we 've which for me personally is at this point because I always thought we were doing in Australia first we 've done much more work here but well that wasn 't how it was going to be so we work all over the world in many different settings it 's always at our level it 's always getting down at the 173 centimeters and understanding what goes on at eye level and how do we understand it and using the whole methodology around making people visible around collecting information about how people use cities where people walk how many at what times of the day so what is the rhythm or doing when they don 't walk and how much time do people spend what are the age groups what is the age and gender split so trying to understand more around the people movements and becoming just as informed as we are on traffic yep waking cross-disciplinary we 've also got anthropologists modern culture all kinds of other different education backgrounds very optimistic about the future we had 16 Gill kits in 2010 so they 're quite an optimistic crowd of people and the overarching goal for us is to again to improve quality of life for people in cities that 's what we are aspiring to and what we are trying to achieve for the project are we doing a create good yeah nice environments when we enjoy spending time what can even be inspired to take our computers out and sit and work for a while and make yeah create new friendships among people who create meeting places where different age groups can come together and meet and create a sense of community and then we also curious why some places this is killed muhabba why do they and why does it feel uninviting and what can we do in the future to avoid places like these another one yeah so yeah these housing developments that I think are global phenomena as well in terms of after is completely forgetting the scale the space the spatial scale between buildings but going straight from benches to buildings and there 's nothing in between yeah and then all the other attractive places where people actually enjoy coming and that become destinations and why is that so what what is it that we 're enjoying and what are the qualities that we enjoy in cities and how can we understand that and translate that into new developments as well yep over populum these guys are watching Australian Open in Federation Square it 's a very popular place and that 's it once it yes it does so it 's all back to the working animal so understanding the physical constraints of the muddle a while commands are being improved all the time new systems high speeds different things turbo diesel or whatever this is the same little creature that walks around are very sensitive in terms we use all our senses in communication we use our senses when we walk through the city and we need a certain amount of stimulus to be able to enjoy places to be able to be feel invited to to walk to different spots the visual sense the view is the most important one and especially at eye level that 's kind of where we take in the majority of all our presents so ground floors of buildings is kind of the crucial it it doesn 't matter about the penthouse or the new thing at the top but how you building meets the city is a really crucial part and that whole interaction between ground level and the city is is critically important in in the senses of transcendence of cities so we 're talking about five kilometers of our architecture what what are those environments and what is needed in terms of detailing and an elements that can help to invite us and what are the 60 kilometer per hour architecture that more talks about getting into your car and moving through and walk through yep then back to when Yan was educated so this is we call this the Brasilia syndrome where you plan the city from above that has been quite yeah been the principle for many for many decades in terms of fixing things so the architecture the eyesight that 's the math master planner of doing the beautiful forms putting together in a wonderful composition and dip it perfect it 's just right and forgetting a little bit on how that influences people 's scale I don 't know so when we sit up here and do big plans like that do side planets like this well what is the experience down at eye level we 're still slow moving little creature so what is the experience that we provided at eye level and how can we make sure that these things up and that we are actually have something interesting to look at then the whole notion around yeah again pulling down so the the early city census and crunking out new and stuff that maybe didn 't really cut the cake for many people that got a notion around scale this is Singapore waterfront very popular you probably know better than I do but very popular stretch to visit in Singapore it 's a build a hundred years ago and lo and behold what is in the background and so for us it 's in two things you understand what happened in between here scale wound up but how about ground floors and how can we create something that meets the city better and we tend to ask don 't ask for the city can do for your building but ask what your building can do for the city so they 're part of a bigger picture and not isolated objects then the whole notion around density how these different models show the same density but in different ways so really you can do the the tower you knew the road houses you can do the more compact city blocks and it 's the same density the same amount of residential going on but they 're just very different ways of arranging your density and with them there are also very different ways of meeting the streets do that and we tend to say that this is sort of the lazy architects response to density and where you need to pay more care so how you actually meet the city and how we create a a good environment and a good microclimate at the ground yep so some of the challenges we tend to get a lot of the manufacture on deserted areas and this is from Copenhagen again in the new development outside the city centre although they 're just as many people walking through here is one of the more popular places in the city centre a very very few choose to spend time here it 's quite windy and it doesn 't feel very vibrant the picture so again it 's about figuring out what how can we understand our preconditions better and this is looking at how public life has developed over the years so this is 100 and this is 2000 so 100 years ago a number of necessary activities took place we had to drag our goods along we had to sell things in the streets we had to walk to took place these have gradually gone down with all of us many of us are in front of computers in our offices or laptop in lemurs and we only have to go out and when to pick up the groceries pick up the kids and I 'll go to work and so the necessary activities are fewer than they used to be and then the optional activities are really what makes cities come alive so people choosing to spend more time so it 's not just about the number of people coming in but it 's also about time spent so how much time do people actually spend and how how can we make places more inviting enough higher quality so that people would choose to spend time in yep so this is worst-case scenario if it 's not provided this it just dies out and becomes deserted and so we need to develop communities that put people first and and provide qualities that people will enjoy and can help create livable cities this is one of the principles that we 've been been working at in terms of looking that can be expected how many people will live here okay go to school pass through come to shop and what out of that what can we expect in terms of the amount of people spending time in the places so what is the public life that take place that happen then what are the public spaces that can create a framework around that are the amenities for it and then what are the buildings that create the public spaces and what are the ground floors that activate them so this tends to reverse the planning process where often when we align different places it 's starting with the buildings then some spaces are created in between and perhaps something is going on in the street so maybe not it 's very hard to fix afterwards if it went wrong it 's better yeah it works better to kind of think it in from the front now I 'm going to show you a little bit from my home region so we are fanos even colder than here you think it 's cold now knows it 's so far north this is Sweden and this is Malmo same size as camper almost 300,000 and there 's a bridge in between everything bridge and this is a new development or ten year old with development that happened anomaly that we 'll just talk briefly about in terms of how that was created and the story around Malmo is that that 's very much a city that went from City of Industry to city of knowledge so that before people would come and locate in the city to work in the different workplaces we 're now a general tendency in many cities is that people go where they find a livable city or where they find a nice city where they can see themselves and their families right and then businesses and workplaces will have to come to these cities so that 's kind of a major shift where we used to have the steel factories I spent time in Wollongong last week where then you had the heavy industry they were cater for workplaces now it 's the other way around and how can cities is more on livability in terms in Malmo 75% of all workplaces where locally located outside the city centre and 15 years later at 75% are moving inside it 's a big change in the city this is the harbour area a lot of industrial land in the city centre and and looking at how would that be developed over time so it 's quite a massive amount of development that will go into this area and the one that I 'm focusing on is this one which was one of the first ones so that 's the prognosis for the entire area is 20,000 more inhabitants 10,000 students and 70,000 workplaces so quite a lot to fit in yeah this is talking something about quick symmetry how easy is to get there and what are destinations around it and this is looking more at the development and 24 hectares of land it 's well in the department 700 inhabitants and looking at creating a mixed-use development and yeah so part of this is that we are up in the cold part of the world with a lot of wind as well and what they were and just twist twist it so that we create so that we actually break out the wind coming from the west to just break up the wind so it 's not so easy for it to filter through the entire development and also and how can we prove that also create more interesting walking routes or more interesting places to stay I 've spent time in in that area so this is the plan that came up in terms of developing these quarterly twisting and turning them a little bit there 's a central park at the back this is the waterfront yeah fine brain that works for many alternative routes very easy to to move around in this is the waterfront this is some of the scale of the housing it 's actually quite high density in this area but the interesting bit is perhaps that they 're looking at this it 's both makes use but it 's also very mixed in terms of how it was developed so there are a number of developers in there the number of different architects and the whole idea was that just kind of makes it makes the architecture so that was constantly challenging and challenging or being attractive to walk through so giving new experiences and also offering different types of residential that would that would attract different types of people yeah so both being able to live in your little one family house but also having higher the residential development yep small courtyards green areas looking at creating places where you could actually spend time where it could be with your family away you could meet friends and how that related back to the more public areas in the city a flexible ground-floor use so that was looking at saying well this development is changing over time and there needs to be some flexibility and have ground floors I equipped so we can change them over time and adapt to to how the area is changing yeah so in many of the deep ground floors you found the corner shop the cafe or some shared facilities shared washing shared whatever and and this all mix worse both along the frontage there so a long street level but also vertically lively at night there 's something going on at night that 's light and those are people overlooking the public spaces so people actually living there looking after it and rapport if something goes wrong a quite focus on sustainability measures as well in terms of providing for an area that has don 't wanna so good very interesting area to visit if you ever get to Malmo or you pop by our office incoming we 're more than happy to take you there so popping over the water and talking a little bit about coming my home city and that has gone gone long and I 'm probably doing this really better gone from being a traffic place to more of a people place and with the overall notion of trying to invite people to walk and bicycle as much as possible and then it shouldn 't be forcing people but it 's just an integrated part of moving so this is how it looked in the 60s and 70s all the squares where parking lots and then in 62 the pedestrian street was first created and that developed into a network of both pedestrianised but also shared space and creating a network that actually activates a larger part of the city center and that creates yeah that takes advantage of the spillover effect from the main pedestrian streets to also invite people to use other paths and also have other uses in the city centre yeah so that 's the pedestrian street before and after some of the squares again before and after by checking parking out and doing it very gradually it was never a massive movement in terms of freeing up space in the city centre and as part of doing it very slowly and over many years the city was also able to step up on public transport in terms of servicing it and this is our waterfront some around small canal coming in that again used to be for parking and now is a restaurant strip were very popular throughout the day this is Thomas well used to be a nightmare to cycle through here and that has again also been simplified the bus station has moved out and now this entire area is constantly transforming and what has happened is that people spend one more time in the city and so the more the more public space a space they 'll add for people to use the more people actually started spending time there and spending longer time there so there 's been a big positive response from citizens in terms of actively and and this year again it 's an hour parking place for people all of them and constantly looks like this throughout summer and also we see now that may be the most positive development has been that one third of the outdoor activities in the evening and entering the early night so that 's a really positive development but it 's incoming it 's taken for four years so a very long time to to make the changes and also come hang started early and was maybe a pioneer in some of it and but what 's interesting is that it 's continuously been documented so yeah inside the university and developed a methodology for how to count people how to map out what 's going on in the it was doing and constantly be able to measure new improvements in the city centre new public spaces and whether they have possibly been positively received or whether it was a failure so it it makes the city more informed it 's not about guessing what 's going on it 's actually about knowing this is a new public land policy the world 's finest sea was adapt to it and put out setting measures on how to increase the level of activity in the city but maybe more interestingly what has happened also incoming is that in order to deliver these projects are now in order to move forward the city has had to move from a situation where the city government was more set up in in different areas to some taking care of the building some living after the trees some looking after transport for getting a little bit about the people into a more holistic thinking around how do all the elements come together and how can they benefit each other and how can you make the whole thing appear as a whole thing and a the synergy of a wider precinct or wide area and won 't fall off as isolated bits but part of a long-term strategy so what 's happening now is the public life is growing in the city center so from the city center and also to the town centers around so people come into the city sense and thinking why do I have to travel all the way in there to get a cup of coffee maybe I could also get that where I live and then that is now growing also the harbor is clean enough so you can actually jump in and get a swim before we could aim and this is probably the only place in the city where you 're happy to walk around in the air in the middle of the city so very interesting change then also the events of increased so the city being used all the time for more events but also for bigger parts of the year not just during summer so we started to understand that well winter is not going to leave us so how can we make the a little bit of that bicycling and just about how that 's a citywide network it 's for everyone it 's for kids elderly families young guys not in lycra but something similar so here just talks about that there 's a citywide network of lanes provided cycling is provided for people and that the modal split has gone up so we got 37% using bicycle this is even going further up now 27% driving cars to the city centre 33% using public transit transit and 5% working the rest people traveling to and from the city centre and again this has been a gradual change for many years and trying to get to this point also is cycling hasn 't always been popular in Copenhagen there was a point where it was decreasing but then all across the citizens energy fray and it was kind of reef or maybe we should encourage more people to bicycle yep so going up a developing incentives for people to go so if you keep at a certain pace you 'll get a green wave you don 't have to hold that advance 's kind of bicycling 2.0 and also interestingly enough 70 percent continue to bicycle in winter and why on earth do they do that a yeah that 's a big question but if you ask people why they bicycle it 's also interesting if you ask them whether it 's because of the environment yeah health yeah prized because it 's cheaper yeah convenience yep it 's convenient it 's reliable you know exactly when you 're going to arrive and and the system is also laid out for you so it 's easy to move around so quite and it was a big part of the bicyclist actually continued although the conditions are challenging yeah so now there 's a new bicycle strategy with the first one which is interesting again that we haven 't done much in terms of actually looking at the end goal it 's been incremental so little steps but all in the same direction but nowadays cycling strategy and major complaint is congestion but that 's yeah so serious congestion and that has had to be helped of in whinings bicycle lanes and also this and it 's grades and stuff there are also people who are a little bit reluctant to make the compromises and to enter actually yeah come to terms with that the city needs to hit a certain balance and that there 's a limited amount to what the traffic that can be invited to go through integrated public transport a very important part you can go from the suburbs into the city centre this is the Grand Prince Frederick this is all she kept half or seek it Hey bicycling as well and so very kind of positive turns around that maybe more even more interesting is that economics so city of Qom pain has been calculating what are the economic it surprises me and he says that the economic advantages of shifting transport from parts of our city is 60 cents per kilometer so the infrastructure is cheaper but also when you live in London you just have to pedal 30 minutes a day you live longer you pay more taxes and you have a more healthy lifestyle and you don 't go to hospitals as often you and so yeah 30 percent level mentality on adults who surprising irregularly and this is kind of a staggering number of saying this is the total health effect on all of the kilometres cycling coming 335 million Australian dollars per year so this is what the city is earning so it 's not about investing in bicycling infrastructure it 's about it 's actually a business almost where the city is really cutting down on health cards getting more taxes and also creating more livable city yep there 's a probably the last one I 'm doing maybe so this is jumping around the globe down more down towards your part of the world so this is looking at Melbourne and I think some of you might know this and some know it but Melbourne did some years back a study looking at transforming and confirming the Australian cities and that was looking at at Melbourne in particular and thinking about how to fit in the future growth in Melbourne a 1 million inhabitants and how that could be done by not focusing at the fringes but feeling differently so fall around Melbourne and with newer developments coming up even further out this was actually building in new poverty zones so with oil prices coming up and petrol price rising eventually and this will be a very expensive house in 30 years time so how could how could Melbourne grow in a different way that didn 't include growing at the fringes with more live growing more at the centre utilising the land yep so this is city centre Melbourne and then looking at what are the corridors where we what are what is already serviced by the tram system and the public transport and the fringes are not and public transport will possibly never get out there but we 've got a number of we 've already made a big investment in public transport so how can we utilize that better and this is looking at then what is the growth that could occur along the corridors to utilize the public transport network that 's already in state and utilize the land that 's already available so yeah building in more and more Street pattern and then just looking corridors and still keep some of the characteristics from Melbourne up the little scale the signal family houses and what you have so not changing the character of the city incredibly much but but looking more at the corridors like this and how how could the future growth what would that look like what happened so yeah so looking at future growth and and how could that be introduced and actually provide you know underpinning public transport but also provide a more exit edge along the corridors where a number of people are working and bicycling anyway today this is another example one of the corridors and again what could happen Nicholson Street what could happen along the corridor if growth was concentrated along the corridor and again utilizing the infrastructure another one so interesting a and the big positive message was that you could easily incorporate the extra burnings in side the vicinity of the city center so you didn 't have to go out and get new greenfield developments but you could actually get it integrated within the city fabric yep also looking at densities again and how way that also feels like Melbourne that doesn 't feel like anywhere else and how how that can be achieved at different levels that doesn 't necessarily include higher eyes should we include that and then okay yeah this is just last week and so Wollongong is 300,000 people South Sydney you know what even better than I do probably but we 've been doing some work we see a will and I 'm looking at the city centre and looking at the public spaces and public life in Wollongong and studying how can how to revitalize the city centre and what how to increase the quality of the public spaces and also how to how to start documenting what 's going on and how the city is performing to be able to come back and measure how the city is changing over time and so again coming from the nose from a very flat little country this is an extraordinary setting we got the escarpment at the back and you got the foreshore here and this is not any ocean it 's the Pacific it 's for us but even a little bit of topography in the city centre is quite beautiful the city centres but walk upon you got a kilometre from the mall down to the for show so it 's quite a walkable to get around in the city centre then we started looking at documenting how many people are working and where they 're working and we it was very concentrated around them all yeah it 's a favorite I 've seen you 're more here as well and it 's the favorite Australian thing of sucking up all the week selling with us but and for saving one guy of having them all here the shopping centre and then the open wound here with the majority of the deaf students there and you don 't have to get very far away from that before it kind of rapidly drops also towards the for show so not a lot of activity outside the mall and also what we looked at was what is the pedestrian patterns during the day how does it increase during weekday and around lunchtime and how what happens at night and closes down with the chef 's and then people go along but there 's a lot of potential in terms of a number of people working there and 34,000 students sort of close by but not in the city centre then looking at the main street that leads Crown Street that leads from one end to the other to the foreshore into the railway station and and sitting Wollongong have been doing a facade rejuvenation program along it that 's been quite successful in in providing some funds for businesses to improve along along with that stretch and I 'm also looking at how to how to upgrade this part of it looking at the mall it 's quite a large mall it 's two times Pitt Street Mall in Sydney and so quite long and quite wide and and it takes a lot for a city of that size to populate it what we found was almost 11,000 people walked past here on a typical weekday a more than the population a fig tree a little suburb just outside and but what we also found was that it was markets on Friday were really important in terms activating it in terms of making it feel more lively and more populated yep the bloom on the foreshore the most popular place for recreational activities that 's where most people go to spend time and it 's only ten minutes away from the mall but still very very few people actually walk down there from the mall so very few people would Clarence it actually using the whole length of Crown Street and there was this tendency to get into your car and just drive very short distances to get to where you wanted to get to because it was so easy and this is hard to see but this is the city center the definition of the city centre Wollongong and it 's actually again twice the size same size as Sydney I can 't read the numbers yes a twice the size of the Sydney CBD so again a massively big area to actually call a city centre and to define in terms of where and future developments should go so in woollen I 'm very much residents are up at the periphery of the core of the city and the only 650 people actually live in the core of the city area which is also part of why I feel it 's quite deserted at night so so what we support of the project has been to discuss is there a need of defining an incentive zone or future innovation zone or something like that that can help to focus investments and growth into the central city area and avoid again that all developments go to the fringes or even further out it was much easier cheaper to develop again looking at density same same stories as before similar densities but very different outcomes looking at what would what what 's the right scale so he said we after iconic buildings totally laughter after an iconic place that still celebrates the US government and how do we how do we deal with the wind that comes in from from the water and yeah so what we know is that the high buildings tend to catch the fast winds and create a downdraft so very windy places are created it more compact and closer together the wind tends to sweep over it again shade that has been mentioned also during today from some of the trips that we 've done in the city that here it 's also really important with getting solar access to the public spaces and how to create the best conditions for their quality of ground for frontages exit again how does to be buildings meet the city and we evaluated frontages in terms of how how actually they were and how enacted they were and what we came up with was that 60% of all frontages in the city center we 're enacted so not much going on and looking at the actor once that was only 17 percent of all entities and then there was a lot kind of in between its acquired an important job to be done in terms of the facade rejuvenation and in terms of looking at how to activate the city all of this was put together in a number of posters that were in public display so all the information that was gathered was put together and size street signs that were put up in the city in different places talking about what 's actually here so what are some of the potentials that we could build them and everything is is now displayed at this website of City world where people are also invited to engage and keep their opinion about it and the next races will then be to talk about what can we then do about it what are some of the projects that could try the child a nuts and and create some of the connections that are missing today yep I think I will probably end here I 've got something more lots more stuff but I think I might take too much time out of the panel discussion so I think I 'll just end it here by saying thank you for inviting me it 's been a pleasure to be here I 've been to Dixon Gungahlin City Center so I 've seen a little bits and pieces for Canberra it 's been a pleasure and the weather has been wonderful so thank you very much _"

    "text": "thank you very much for the invitation to come and speak today and thank you for the introduction we 'll just get the PowerPoint slide up so I was good coming back to Canberra I lived here for nine years and if you scratch me I still bleed lime green and if my pulse always goes at that tiny fraction Y hear the word Canberra Raiders so it 's always good to be back you even though I think lastly few seasons haven 't been the best but Ricky will turn around okay in this work I 'm going to talk about in this presentation going to talk about some work I 've done with some colleagues relatively recently so this is work we did in 2011-2012 uh Emma myself or listed here but also we had colleagues such as Rebecca Bentley and Lawrence Lester involved in this project hope they 'll get this to work what I want to do in this presentation is provided context and summary of what we know about housing and disability in Australia and how we need to understand housing in disability then I I want to talk about housing careers and then I want to talk about estimating the risk of homelessness for both the general population but also for the population of persons with various forms of disability and I want to talk eular about why intellectual developmental disabilities are particular focus here then I 'm going to finish off with some discussion around issues around dwelling design and I guess what I think of is the broader social context of provision of accommodation for persons with intellectual disability and why it 's important so I guess what we all know is that housing affordability is a major problem in Australia we know that 1.2 million households in Australia roughly face difficult housing circumstances and this isn 't a cyclical problem this is a problem that 's been evident probably since about the year 2000 rent and mortgage costs have increased significantly for many Australians by almost fifty percent and we 'll see that there 's a serious housing shortage the national housing supply council in their 2012 report estimated that the shortfall was around 30,000 dwellings across Australia whereas in they 200,000 dwellings significant shortfall of course many that much of that shortfall is really a shortfall in terms of distribution rather than absolute numbers because there are many people are in second or even third homes for various reasons about 106,000 people homeless census night in 2011 according to the new and modified methodology interestingly that number was very similar to the 2001 method enumeration of the homeless population since it 's not and so a new method and new sets of policies hadn 't really shifted the number of people at enumerators homelessness I know in South Australia there isn 't really no evidence that despite probably a decade a very focus work on homelessness there 's no much evidence that the homeless population is actually smoke getting smaller the rain government when it came to power in 2002 you made homeless as a major focus of the social inclusion initiatives a huge review and huge refocusing of efforts but homelessness remains a major problem in South Australia and something like continue to get priority till in terms of social policy development is up to thirty percent of low-income are forced porn positions in order to pay rent and I think it was one of the major findings of some work done by the Australian housing Urban Research Institute we paid of Thebes and Terry Burke indicating just the level of extent to which people go without food in order to pay rent and keep a roof over the head so first I want to talk about some some of the outcomes of our research and this research is actually published on the I can never remember it 's the national homelessness Clearinghouse the Australian homelessness Clearinghouse but if you look there and go looking for our research report on homelessness and disability or non psychiatric disability you 'll find the research what you find is that if you look at the population without disabilities which is the diagram to immediate left you 'll find that as expected home purchase and outright home ownership remains the dominant tenure across all of Australia 's population if you then look across each of those other sets of bar charts what you find is firstly persons with a disability or households that have a different tenure pattern there must let much less likely to be person the muscle much less likely to be in home purchase some groups are more likely to be outright homeowners and that 's an important point and they 're also much more likely to be private renters and in particular public renters and I draw your attention to the fact that don 't have got a pointer on this one person to the intellectual disability a much more reliant on the population on public rental housing than any other group that we identify there and they 're also much less likely to be in home purchase than the other group that we identify their about twenty-seven percent compared to almost sixty percent for the Australian population overall so key message here is that firstly persons with a disability in their households occupied different forms of tenure compared to the rest of the Australian population secondly that persons with a disability are at one group that if you even break them down into four broad categories you find their significant differences and as I 'll discuss later it disability of course it 's wrong to suggest that all persons with intellectual disability the same the nature severity and impacts of cognitive disability or intellectual disability of course vary considerably so this is a complex issue with a complex set of challenges in a policy setting and if you look at the distribution of a person 's or households with disabilities physical disabilities dominate psychological important century and speech are important in intellectual disabilities are fourth very important but overall the other point I 'd make and are probably evident everyone here is that psychological disability is the group most likely to experience homelessness so if you look at the homeless population estimates are eighty percent of the homeless population are have some point of a psychological disability or psychiatric disability I 've no reason to doubt that one of the key issues is that of course people with the psychiatric disability often have comorbidities in terms of disabilities and one of the issues that emergence from our research is that often people with intellectual disabilities acquire psychological disabilities after becoming homeless so a very unfortunate but fairly typical intellectual disabilities gets larger reaches adulthood becomes difficult in the Hart family home parents or caregivers don 't really know what to do what do they do they don 't really do much that I address the problem is not support available for them the person become behavior in the home becomes more challenging they leave home somehow they end up either on the street or they end up in a shelter they don 't do that and they quite a psychiatric disability through that process it might be exposure to substances it might be exposed to violence it might be exposure to poor living conditions but they acquire a psychological disability on top of the intellectual disability and partly that it can be because people working in the homeless and shelters stroke service provision are used to diagnosing people with psychiatric disabilities when it may not truly be a psychiatric disability so comorbidity is a major issue you 're not just looking at neat barriers in terms of what person having presenting with one issue rather than a suite of issues one of the key issues is that people mobile through the housing market now you can say is that that 's actually a good thing because in fact they 're stable they have stable housing arrangements for them but of course it 's also a bad thing because it means that when we move through the housing market we tend to move for fairly good reasons we 're adjusting our housing to meet our needs and if we 're not adjusting our housing to meet our needs it means it may not be occupying the housing the best suits our needs at that point in time so people with disabilities overall tend to have a mismatch if you like between their housing and their current set of needs and some work we did for hurry on 21st century housing careers for persons with a disability clearly identified that is major a major issue persons with a disability and the households were much more likely to want to move from the population overall and of course once again we see some variation and of course cyclic person to the psychological disability much more much more likely to have moved process of moving from place to place or so draw your attention to fact that for many people your health condition your disability is a major cause of why you move through the housing market compared to persons without disability is being or reporting your disability as a reason for moving through the housing market and if you look at a low income households what we find and this can be it 's no surprise to anyone in this room persons with disability are much poorer and they have much greater difficulties in terms of paying their rent and mortgages and we see once again a gradient psychological to the psychological disability at the top and then persons the intellectual disability second highest proportion of households on low incomes struggling to pay relatively higher mortgages or rent and also reporting relatively low rates of struggling to pay rent overall now one of the things that I my colleagues worked on over the years is housing careers so we 've looked at housing crees mining and port we produce who he called 21st century housing careers in Australia 's housing futures about first of all the traditional approach of a housing ladder where young households start off at the bottom no work their way up until they move from living with parents private rental public rental all the way to outright ownership that the Great Australian Dream realized in many respects and we suggested that that 's not always the case that in fact for many people in fact your housing through the life course is in fact a series of transitions and in fact it 's really a game of snakes and ladders sometimes you 're going up and sometimes you 're going down if you 've ever been divorced separated you know the down side looks like you know divorce is really bad for your housing career I just don 't recommend it to anyone as part of their housing strategy over the life honestly I don 't and if you then look over here you see something we talked about the life course over periods life ending at age 82 most of us in this room actually get more than 82 if you 're a woman aged 16 expectancy but you see a period where you move from various ten years and then you get serious a period of but incomes and expenditure in various times your income is greater than your expenditure which is good and various times your expenditures greater than your income which is not good and we then talked about the impact of inheritance or show the impact imperatives being cared for providing care to others which is increasingly an important part of people 's life experiences in Australia and of course a really bad thing of divorce which has me and direct impact on tenure for many people but if we talk about people with the housing groups of people with a disability what we 're talking about is something different we 're talking about a number of things we 're talking about low incomes we 're talking about high housing costs talking about limited options within the housing market limited capacity to fade fine pay work which is really important and the costs associated with the disability as well so if we look at the forward disability types that we examined we disability developmental disability or intellectual develop ability front of flat housing Cree often got relatively few options available to them particularly if the disability means they can 't find pay work and they need care and in this example we were talking about households that were living essentially in independent living units which is the term they used in Victoria over here mobility impairment through injury going through the anticipated life course and housing direct you typical Australians and then you come off your motorbike quite our brain injury or become a paraplegic and all of a sudden your housing career becomes somewhat limited and then you move mobility impairment from birth sensory disability and psychiatric disability include significant periods of homelessness and very low incomes van comes in excessive spent below expenditure um one of the things we want to do is we want to talk about the risk of homelessness and so in the 2011-2012 piece of work we actually did some work where we looked at the factors that can lead to persons becoming at risk of homeless homelessness and so I will devote an index of per se these aren 't people reporting their homes but they had the characteristics of people who were homeless if you can understand and appreciate that difference and what we looked at I rhr standard stand for index relative housing risk and there that 's the risk of becoming homeless so oops I want to extreme but and go back which I don 't think i can i 'll just show you on this side one extreme what you see is you have a population overall to the black line that 's the general risk of homelessness for the australian population and it 's roughly a normal distribution the other other hand you 've got the bar charts which show you what 's the relative risk of homelessness for the population affected by different types of duelin two different types of disabilities so the physical disability for sensory disability for intellectual disability and for psychological disability now what you find is that in fact for some forms of disability the risk of homelessness which is seven eight nine high risk of homelessness both so for sensory disability sections lower than person is the psychological or psychiatric disability is higher than general population that 's exactly what we would expect so it 's sort of ground truthing of providing face evidence that the index is measuring something that we would expect but what we found to our somewhat surprised is that in fact very few people with intellectual disabilities had low risk of homelessness very few but more people had a higher risk of hummus than we expected and as a significant middle cohort so persons with intellectual disability were our unexpected finding in this piece of research because what we found is that there are at high risk of homelessness and we didn 't actually anticipate that when we started this piece of work we expected this we didn 't expect this and we probably didn 't expect this while the difference between sensory and intellectual because I think we have better policies programs and procedures for dealing the sensory disability than we have the intellectual disability intellectual disabilities a much more complex policy task or ask then sensory disability Royal Society for the blind we have a specialist pension communities of deaf people there were local entities of persons with vision impairment you don 't necessarily find that in the intellect invincibility field onset of disability might also have a deep impact as well thank you very much so differential risk of homelessness highlights groups extreme risk of homelessness and within our population with intellectual disabilities what we find is schooling employment restrictions intellectual disabilities are major challenges in terms of your risk of homelessness so exposure is not evenly distributed and these two groups here psychological disabilities and mental illness as reported in the general social survey or actually as expected but the fact that schooling employment restrictions intellectual disabilities are actually a major problem I guess the key message I want to give to you is that one of the things that we found is that somewhat to have surprise having a mild intellectual disability was actually a major challenge we would have assumed that there was a gradient a greater your disability they go to your risk in terms of intellectual disability but of course if you 've got a considerable disability there are government support you really risk and if you have schooling difficulties learning difficulties mild intellectual disabilities you 're not going to be competitive in Australia 's labor market in 2012 2006 2002 and that puts and often you behave interact and do everything in a way that people understand within the general community but you 're at risk because you 're making poor decisions you 're at risk because you 're not able to get into the labor market etc I just want to make a couple of points about design I think there 's actually very little work in Australia on dwelling design in terms of persons with intellectual disability but i 'll give you what I 've been able to to Glenn over time first of all building code of Australia doesn 't actually make any mention of intellectual disability and that 's something we 're thinking about and that 's something that could probably be addressed in various ways there are twice as many in selective just about intellectually disabled Australia 's our vision impaired so that 's a significant gap one of the key issues with it persons this you about wayfinding you need to have dwellings which allow easy way finding how do you find your way through how do you walk into a building and immediately know where you should be going I walked into this building and I had to ask where I was going so you know I don 't think I 've learning to talk to a disability if I did have an intellectual disability with problem why filings important dwelling design needs to assist the process of wayfinding and these powerpoints are provided to our organizers so it go through them but essentially you need things to be clear you need to be concise you need to have signage which is consistent which is legible which uses culturally accepted culturally accepted colors for various forms of in various forms of signage you need to have clear line of sight I walk into a building I see the table I wanted to go to I see the building i need to remind go to and that is where i go to straightaway that 's the sort of design we need i would just it i 'm almost out of time i guess there are a couple of things to consider one is yes there are things to say about building design but building design in terms of neat involves consultation with persons with intellectual disability involves wayfinding involves eligibility but really we need to be thinking more broadly about the building design or the design of housing for persons with intellectual disability working with non-government organizations in South Australia one of the things that if emphasizes the broader social context and the literature does this as well the broader social context of accommodation provided so it 's about not providing concentrations persons with a disability there 's a program recently on the ABC called dream home where three or four adults with Down syndrome and moved into an independent living away from their parents and they tracked them through that process it 's been critiqued in the disability community because they put all people with intellectual disability in one room in one dwelling in fact the preferred mole is then you mix them up with persons with a disability and persons without a social context we need to acknowledge that there is a risk of homelessness for this group we need to ignite this risk is greater than this or other persons with a disability in many instances and that we need to consider how persons with relatively mild disability is going to be affected by this process so it 's about supply it 's about good design is about social setting thank you very much you _"

Stanhope was the chief minister as i was walking over to the Cabinet Room I said to the head of the service I said has my seat changed and she said no you see it hasn 't changed so not much changes and when Minister gentleman came in and we gave him a small map of the table when we put his head where he needed to sit and he 'll sit there until we change the cabinet again so we had some committees of cabinet we talked about the budget and i 'll take you through the budget cycle but we never stopped talking about the budget as a government expenditure review so that 's really what unkind people call the razor gang but what we consider looking for efficiencies and parks and conservation capital metro that would be the 12 or 13 kilometres of light rail between the gun gotham city centre and the center of town is the first step to a light rail network urban development that 's where planning is a big issue in this town as you would expect because we have both municipal functions and state functions so we have an urban development committee of cabinet that really just talks about yet urban planning and land use policies and Security and Emergency Management cabinet which we get together every now and then and that 's probably i 'd like to tell you a lot about what happens in that one because that one 's almost the most interesting cabinet meeting but it does involve the chief police officer and the head of the esa and we talked a little bit about counterterrorism and bushfire threats and other other things that if we knew too much about we wouldn 't sleep we take our security of our documents very seriously so each of our cabinet ministers and officials are given a cabinet iPad which has cabinet and if if a cabinet iPad got stolen and we can shut it down remotely if this year I think we 've lost two cabinet documents that have turned up at the canberra times and the AFP been called on both occasions so we do take the security of of what goes to cabinet quite quite seriously the chief minister chairs the cabinet meeting and really it 's it 's part it 's part team meeting you know just think you and your six colleagues getting together what 's up what 's happening this week so its part to meeting and part discussion around what sue talked about you know ministers talking about what they saw in the weekend who they bumped into these part of that that goes on in that sort of team meeting environment but the submissions that come to cabinet and the discussions around proposals and these quite a formal process the chief absolutely decides what gets on the agenda what is not on the agenda if she 's not happy with Urban Development Committee for example she might not call a meeting for years it 's the chief show and has ever been thus and if I went to a different government it 'll be the Prime Minister 's show or the premier show but it really is achieve and her team getting together so this is what cabinet does I had to look it up in a textbook so that I could give you the right answer they make political decisions decisions they resolve disagreements they decide policy and strategy exchange information ensure whole-of-government coordination and set rules for government administration so when they come together they do make political decisions and Jenny asked you know we had a couple of questions earlier today about you know where does the politics come and I think in the Cabinet Room that 's the time where advice provided by the public service gets put in advice provided by their political advisers gets put in advice provided by their party mechanism by think tanks by lobbyists all of that gets discussed in the room about what what the cabinet ministers are hearing on the street certainly the documents that go other than documents they may be the minister 's own those documents once the decision is made of cabinet we you know we type up that will write up the decision the head of the public service is officially the cabinet secretary and that becomes a shared government decision so all ministers own that decision and it 's it 's not appropriate to after the decision to go I will I 'd never really like that or that was minister corbels idea or we let that one go through because minister bar was in a bad mood there 's none of that discussion it becomes the government decision and that is the decision that is then implemented furiously by the public service as a whole it 's up to the ministers to balance the politics the policy in the administration it 's for the public servants to worry about policy in the administration of you so when we do decision making when it comes forward there 's always an analysis of the options of the available options for government to act we do a triple bottom line assessment so we assess the government assesses whether it impacts of anything we look at a communication strategy it 's very important to this government that they tell the community to be out what they 're up to and keep the community informed regulatory impacts and financial implications is also a part in there every cabinet submission where we talk about consultation and that 's consultation both internal to government so if health is doing something what does education think if Community Services is doing something does it overlap with Jax and what does the Treasury think of it but also engagement with external stakeholders you know that engagement with the external stakeholders can take many forms that can have formal consultation processes over six weeks it can be include rammed tables you can unsolicited voice comes to the government in many forms so that that 's acknowledged now having talked a lot about the the secrecy of our documents we are a very open government two weeks after the fact we let people know and what we decided in cabinet by putting out a small summary of the cabinet outcomes and i think i think on last count an immense amount of interest in the work of cabinet and i did the maths and there were 70 members of the Legislative Assembly but six of them already in there so I can is six others but these are and Robert yachts so now we haven 't tracked down the amount of people that do that but I think what it is what it is is understanding that the the chief minister and she 's spoken on this she 's committed to keeping people informed and even if it is underutilized the fact that we do it and we 're open to it keeps people up to date with at least what we 're doing two weeks after the fact so it 's a it 's a small summary it doesn 't have any of the juicy bits but it tells you what was discussed and and what the general decision was another thing unique to the territory is that we release our cabinet documents only ten years later after they 've been considered so at one extreme or at the federal cabinet it 's 30 years so people cabinet secretary and you 're a nerd like myself we we scour the New Year 's newspaper and find out what was discussed in cabinet 30 years earlier in New Zealand they have a real open government approach and actually release the documents in a couple of weeks after so they take a very different approach to to them and we have one where ten years and we release those on camera day so we just release it a list of the documents that were discussed ten years earlier at that time we normally get a few calls from the camera times and interested policy wonks around town and we we send out the documents I think when the 10-year mark was put in no one actually thought that they were being government for 10 years so it 's quite interesting to be in a place where it certainly Minister gallaher and later minister bar were in the early cabinets and we 're releasing the documents out of that so that either again we be open and transparent now we 'll talk about the exciting topic of the budget which 's a bit of doom and gloom around town people will have seen that the doom and gloom around and Commonwealth public service cuts etc and i think that 's that 's absolutely true i mean we have had a that we have seen a decrease you need to state migration the normal people that move into town didn 't move into town this year discretionary spending is down in this town at the moment and i think what happens is when you 're concerned about your job you don 't buy a coffee you don 't go out for dinner you know you start you decrease your consumption you decrease you can see me confidence and if you 're running on a small business you don 't put on an extra part-time employee you just we 'll just see we 'll just do so i think there 's a little bit of a little bit of that around the town the government the acct government is certainly concerned about that but also i 'll just put in perspective they don 't the acct government really doesn 't have the spending the annual budgets around 4.5 to 4.9 billion dollars which is less than ten percent of the acct economy so even if we decided to and you never would even if you doubled the spending of the acct government it would have less than twenty percent impact on the UM on the acct economy so we are as a government a small a small player in this town and but they said we can do things I think people would have seen this year or the Stephenson oh here we go the next slide cuz I 'll talk about it so this is known fact that is this where it comes from so that 's that 's what makes up four point eight billion dollars 4.5 billion dollars so come with grants that 's you know driving health and education taxation which we all love pain i enjoy enjoy every time i get a parking fine i think yes investing in my community so if anyone should think that it 's just another investment in the community and giving our word for the isotope nothing i should be able 's just a running costs for me um interest income sales goods and services and so that that 's roughly what it is and people will be aware that that taxation makes the the treasure is going through a big change to move us from less less reliance on stamp duty and one off taxes and more reliance on rates so that thirty two percent will remain thirty two percent it 's just what 's in it will change and here 's what we spend it on it 'll it 'll surprise you all I 'm sure 1.4 billion dollars on health you know that 's where the cash is if you want to know where the money is it 's in health government schooling so healthy and smart 2.5 billion dollars to get through our health and education systems disability justice and community safety housing policing and emergency services that 's nearly a billion dollars there urban renewal 700 million and then growing the economy 300 million but our big expenditures absolutely health and education if you want to know if health expenditures got a 10-year average of growing will be will be well actually will only do health by about twenty fifty because we might have money for anything else education runs at about six percent on a 10-year average disability in the last five years has been about a forty percent increase each and every year so they 're big spends and big increases in those in those areas about forty seven percent of that is wages for the oct governments I think about your own organization so it 's you know that 's that 's where the money is we 've got about nine and a half thousand FTE or twenty three thousand public servants so that 's a that 's a big lot health 6100 FTE education 4700 FTE so these are big organizations that we 're running in a you know in a relatively small town and when it comes to budget time just again to put it in perspective when we have the big gala day of budget day which is a highlight of the it 's a highlight of the calendar for most of us we 're really only fighting over about on budget day will write will ranking around about a hundred million dollars if we 're lucky in a good year so about two and a half percent so that means basically ninety-eight percent of your budget is what we did last year so if you want to know what their budget next year is going to look like have a look at this year 's budget its ninety-eight percent written if you want the one after that it 's also ninety-eight percent written so there 's not a lot of change so when we 're fighting for new initiatives both all looking for new expenditures we 're not looking to we 're not going to close Canberra Hospital to put that money somewhere else Canberra Hospital be there for a while so we are all fighting for a very very small amount of money as search ad man said earlier the best idea really i would say for the community segment is the same thing we do how can we make the work that we do fit in with an election commitment how can it fit into a parliamentary within the current spend because if you 're waiting for new cash it 's hard to get that new cash and it 's going to be harder for the next well you know the foreseeable four or five years this just shows only Treasury would put together a graph like this and it shows where our money goes over your life span so when you 're born you get about 12 grand a year and then you go to school and then when you were you 're working out today city government doesn 't spend much money on you at all and then you hit 60 and then you hit our health system so only if you 're only Treasury would think to put that together but I thought that just shows where I spend that 's where our spin goes so that 's why we do have a world-class health system that 's why we have a 1.5 billion dollar health system and we have a you know a wonderful school system but all of us but the acct government spends its money on schools and hospitals after that we put together the budget well this is how the government puts together the budget on the first tuesday in june we are we we have budget day which is the festival and then on Thursday Susan run the SIA the ACT cost forum where she tears apart the budget and we all we all go back and and self-flagellating which we 've done something and then we have estimates and that 's where the opposition parties get to question every dollar spent by the government and that 's every dollar that 's the four point nine billion dollars so that 's something that public servants particularly enjoy those two weeks where we get to justify our existence and then in August the budget is debated in the assembly and then we start again and then it sep tember comes and we start working on next year 's budget so today or tomorrow the the treasurer will announce that budget consultation 2015-16 it opens today or opens tomorrow he doesn 't need you released tomorrow and runs until October the 13 last year I 'll talk about the consultation I that 's when treasury come across and the treasurer says by the way we don 't have any money and that 's what they do every november then we agree that we have no money then we think of a plethora of good ideas either brought to us by the public service or the community we weren 't furiously over those over the summer months and then we come back in February we we still haven 't got any money any are 300 good ideas retracts to about a hundred good ideas and then over a period of the next two months we argue out of those hundred good ideas which 40 will get money and then we announce the budget and then we go to the eighth cost forum and then we go to estimates and we do it all again so that 's a that 's the yearly cycle of the budget there 's no secrets in that I think this treasurer has been extremely keen to get early consultation which is why it 's the September in October because that 's the reality of if it 's but the government needs to find the money the decisions would take some time to be worked out so last year the submissions you can do them online or you can send them in probably many people in this room we 're part of the 80 people that wrote in but you know I don 't know if anyone 's here from the equestrian association Roman films property council cares a CT Deacon residents association but also once brought on to yourselves a CT shelter Youth Coalition ywc a so 80 submissions were received over that over that six-week period and then they are considered as well and some individuals some local Canberrans probably about a dozen local Ken Burns just decide to put in a submission on their own behalf but dust a stress yet again we 're really where we 're fighting over about 2 2.5 percent of the budget if we 're lucky so every consultation vice consultation and this consultation has the same series of questions and they 're online and you can either fill them in on the online form but what services do you health and education our spending pattern would show that you 've guessed correctly but this is really about what does the community want what infrastructure priorities should the government consider are there any services that we could deliver more efficiently and I think that 's where truly that I think that 's where we can draw in the community because I think we 've all seen an arm of government that you wonder I wonder why that doesn 't quite work or why does it take me 25 minutes to try and work out the online form to enroll market at preschool not that that happened but you know there might be more efficient ways and that 's the sort of thing that we could we could do this one 's a hard one but you know should anything be a fee-for-service you know you know probably there 's certainly people in this community that are doing it tough and I don 't discount that but these many people in this community on jul incomes who are probably accessing services for free with a health education or any of our that 's what the government is interested to know and can we stop providing a particular service and that 's also going to be a different one I don 't think anyone ever has ever suggested that we stop providing a service but we 'll see anyhow that 's that 's there 's an online form you can fill it out or you can send in a formal formal consultation and then that will be be fed into the mix then just talk a little bit about how to get involved with government generally which is so there is the formal consultation process that we talked about and answer Chapman also talked about bumping the ministers at the IGA and and getting information from our community but it is true in this town we are part of our community and many of those casual conversations do turn it into good ideas or at least get questioned and they certainly do get followed up on but if you want to all our consultations are at that time to talk a CT gov that are you Twitter cabinets something that when I Australia which I which I do do they laugh at the thought of Twitter cabinet knowing that cabinet is a very important thing that you know with all the processes that have existed since Menzies when I say that you know we 've got a young we 've got a young cabinet we do we got a young cabinet there all I fait with social media and they can hit on the Twitter cabinet what happens on Twitter cabinet is the cabinet ministers do go into the Cabinet Room we set them all up with laptops these big screens not dissimilar to this and people tweet questions or comments to the government and the ministers sit there and busily tweet back and it 's hilarious to watch but also it 's if you want instant access to the minister 's it absolutely happens it is there yeah I was going to I was going to point out like even on Facebook or LinkedIn if you follow mr. barrel or that they actually do that themselves we actually don 't have 150 public servants that are tweeting on behalf of the when the the treasure is not sleeping because he had a lot of late-night updates and in the eyes in a bad mood but he tweets he does all his own tweets he does all his own linkedin updates he does all his own facebook updates and they are keen to get involved and we 're actually we are thinking around once we move we 'll Wi-Fi throughout the city you know how do we engage widely and with people when they 're on the run when people are busy on the run they might not have time to hit in Community College our formal submissions but good ideas can be you know in a tweet and the the chief minister also has their blog in her age I think she gets some people to help her write it but she certainly she certainly got a she they 're very personal messages so again she 's that 's that 's how you can access the chief minister chief minister topic is a hoot for the listen to it we are not the Northern Territory is the other they also have in the government in Australia that go down that path you can n on chief ministers talk back absolutely we follow up everyone and not only do we follow up we publish a fortnight afterwards the follow-up that we 've done as a public service the chief minister loves that time and she also makes sure that anyone who rings up at least gets a phone call or their problem address quite quickly so think about for yourselves through your own organizations or for your people that you 're dealing with these are the ways that you can access government without having to learn the wonders of cabinet and the wonders of the budget process you can still certainly engage with our ministers and you can email them direct their emails you know to reveal the secret they don 't do their own emails they do their own Twitter they don 't they don 't all do their own emails so sometimes you 'll send in an email and you 'll just a screw you know I 'll just by the way that sound so happen and then then three know three other bureaucrats and you know have been thousands of dollars of taxpayers money is gone into responding to that email or you just tweet them you guess which I would prefer you do now it 's really what we found and we 're talking to a guy from Queensland premieres and they 've just done a they did a survey of constituents that road to government and they found that of the constituents that road to government forty-four percent of them actually didn 't want to reply they just want a government to know what they thought now we in the territory we one hundred percent you write to a minister you will get a reply our ministers drive that absolutely but isn 't that interesting how people engage with with government that they just want their they want government to know what 's going on but they don 't want a series of bureaucrats to give them a bureaucratic reply they want someone to to listen so I think that 's there 's something that I 'm spending a bit of time thinking about you know how Canberra because those are busy lives you know we 've got school pickups with your group of appointments to make we 've all got that so how can we engage with our community in a meaningful fashion but also for time poor people and we also had a digital newsletter on the Canberra Connect website what you can do there is you can even just log on get yourself a little profile on Canberra connect and then tick the boxes of what you 're interested in and if something if the government 's pushing out a message or a media release that hits one of your topics it 'll just get sent to you so that 's not a feedback chain I suppose that 's an information-sharing channel for the government to to inform what 's going on but they said I think about 30,000 cam bearings received some information via that channel so i think what what I 'm saying at the end is really the government is trying to keep engaged I think consultation takes many forms and you know in this formal consultation but there 's also it but also how we should do it and so I think just trying to keep engaged with with government because many people don 't spend their careers in government unlike myself I think that was all I was going to say I will Alison saw that another 11 other consultation that happened this year after the federal government budget the Chief Minister pulled together a few round tables so that if you look at our cabin our budget cycle that was like right at the deaths door you know a lot of months and months of work had been into it but the Chief Minister Paul put together some round tables there was a business one and there 's community sector one there 's a young people one and truly in that final sort of two weeks of the budget things were changed so it 's a long as it 's a long birthing but things still can 't changing that in that process and I think the chief minister is going to report back either in October or November on the outcomes of those round tubes but again budget came out from the feds on Tuesday let 's get together on thursday let 's have a quick thing about what we can do let 's change the acct government budget just a little bit so I think that 's the way we 're consulting the community has evolved over over the 13 years of the Stanhope gallaher government and I think it would be remiss not to take up those opportunities and so you know if I can get someone in my team that would teach me how to use Twitter I 'm sure someone can find a twelve-year-old that can I don 't know i 'll just say a little twitter fact cuz I thought I was really hip when I got onto Twitter you know I thought I 'd be breaking new ground and then I found out the average age of a Twitter user is 38 and I 'm thinking I know where I fit in that bell curve and i thought i was with the young people so that 's cabinet and process in consultation happy to take questions on any of those topics common funding these are a process by which the budget process or the cabinet process can address that to look at whether other contingency funds are used for web process of winding down well the process is exactly the same what it what it really is is it 's a call for new funding you know it 's the Commonwealth stepping out of stepping out of an area that the Commonwealth traditionally did fund the as treasurer bar set at that forum there there is no there is no fallback plan either you also said let 's see what gets through the Senate and let 's see what budget is actually delivered but the other thing and the reality of it is if the Commonwealth pulled out health funding there is no way unless we tripled quadrupled in no way we could feel every gap the ICT government wouldn 't have the capacity the the taxing capacity to feel every gap of the Commonwealth however if if any program was defunded Botica by the Commonwealth and the need still exists on demonstrated need a CT government would have to act and and actually the there is a Senate inquiry into the into the impacts of the of the of the abbot budget and our government has put in a submission into that and it just outlines exactly that that we don 't have the capacity to step in it 's not right that the the acct government should step in just because of a change of Commonwealth Government I think it 's only went for an interesting time in this space people health reform took three lots of goes before health reform actually got through a co egg so and then it got through and then he almost you know within 12 months of the third go of it getting through Co egg and the Abbott government 's walked away from that third wave of reform so I think it 's an interesting time in that intergovernmental State Commonwealth relations there 's a white paper on Federation which is also a policy debate being had with that so that 's that 's a broader context in reality if if these are demonstrated need the the government would way up that sees but I don 't know yeah there 's a lot of I 'm surprised that I mean when you think of budgets and we 've all been around for a while the you r inland budget night would be the lock up the formal lock up and then they 'd they 'd cut to the commentators and the commentators would talk and then they talk to their a cost may see to you and there 'd be the whole line of you and now tweeting alone seems to get as much media coverage in the days after the federal budget I 'm surprised at how governments are responding to that including this government so you should write a letter that put it but it made you look like a formal business case because you know it will have to be a formal business case at some point questions the directorate 's yep the extent to which they don 't talk to each other I 'm perhaps not thinking of the cabinet level process there is a lot of stuff that doesn 't go to cabinet I was wondering if yeah okay and the question was how does the public service the bureaucracies the directorate 's work together or work across or communicate pryda fingers going to cabinet or prior to them being elevated to cabinet i think is probably more more important one thing that we 've had since since 2011 since the the change to the ICT public services we have a strategic board where the head of services the head of the service and all the directors general me and they made on a fortnightly basis and that 's to discuss and both the policy and the administration of the government there is a keenness by both previous head of service in this one for early engagement so in the cabinet process absolutely any document that goes to cabinet gets circulated to every other agency at least twice in the development of that process and you hope that that 's also backed up by either round tables or consultation so there 's a very formal process of it going around twice and you can read textbooks around that because that we actually follow that the policy cycle is these it 's more about the value that is placed on it and the acct public service has been told well and truly by the government that they need to talk to each other more and I think that 's what 's being rewarded and that 's what 's being valued so I think that sets the values of the of the service but you can 't you you can 't get away from the fact that human services of human services and where did delivery with the one community so the more we work together both at the coalface at the service delivery end at the policy proposal in end of the cabinet end hopefully that would that would get it but is certainly a great value placed on working together questions all I have to say that one of the things that I learned it out of that this is now my personal objective to reduce pressure on the acct budget it just might be yours as well and that is to work until you 're a key stay healthy the whole time live in your own way that way will protect the acct budget so that 's my mission from now on my mission is to pay enough parking fines so that when i do get here i 'll be out on a hill system that uh that will save me so join me in thanking _"

    "text": "so thank you very much it 's it 's a real pleasure to be able to have an opportunity to contribute to this conversation it 's one of the most important conversations I think for the future of people with disability and the NDIS is obviously going to work on one part that the issue of housing is a really challenging issue so just very quickly about the summer foundation it was established in 2006 its mission is to stop young people going into nursing homes because there 's nowhere else for them to go and basically we work on three key strategies the first is research so developing an evidence base that will give us the grounding for the sort of policy change that we will be advocating for creating a movement so that we can keep the issue in the public mind and on the political agenda and the third part is the housing part which is establishing a small number of demonstration projects around integrated housing and support for people in our target group so what I 'm going to do in this presentation is give you projects that we 're working on to talk a little bit about why the summer foundation is establishing these projects and then to spend most of the time on a discussion of the the various aspects and insights in more detail with a particular focus on on design and technology but also a little bit on support and then talk a little bit about the NDIS and some of the opportunities and some of the issues for some of the models what has struck me sitting through the earlier two presentations is just the similar themes I 'm talking about quite a different target group here than we 've talked in the first two presentations but the themes it 's it 's like we 've been given a list of themes to work to because they 're just so similar if there 's time I also would like to just show you a short DVD at the end so the core features of the demonstration projects that we are working on individual units peppered through a well located apartment building Universal Design highly accessible and adaptable communication and home automation approach balanced with some efficiencies from close proximity of the units access to 24-hour emergency support one support provider for the first two years and property in tenancy management by community housing organization so why is the summer foundation establishing these types of projects the first and foremost reason is that the research and consultation that has been done tells us that we need a wider range of models and opportunities for young people who end up in nursing homes or who are on their way to their because there is nothing else and end up in in very poor alternatives one of the other reasons and particularly now with the NDIS is a need to think accross building design technology and support approach and how they can work together to support greater independence and deliver better outcomes in the past often those components have been very very separate and there hasn 't been an opportunity to think about how they might all come together and to actually plan and deliver projects where they all thought about together so it 's an opportunity to do it slightly differently so we and critical reflection often there isn 't the time when you 're developing new models to actually do this the summer foundation has thought there is a need to be able to do that because we actually don 't know how to do it well and we need to continue to work out how to do it effectively and to deliver the best outcomes for the people that will be the beneficiaries of of these types of new models so there 's a very strong action research focus the other part is to document and formally evaluate so that we have really good information about what works and what needs to happen to be able to sustain these models so there 's a strong focus on post occupancy evaluation and outcome focus for people in these projects and also the summer foundation is doing this so that it can encourage replication of the model and of the ideas that come through the model so the role of the summer foundation is actually a broker of the ideas and the model we 're not a service provider but we do contribute contribute the housing component there would be no project but it really is important week so the job is to actually work out how you put this whole model together how you assemble it and how you get it in place so you can work out how it works and what you need to do so ultimately we would like to be able to provide hard evidence that well-located good quality well-designed and accessible and adaptable housing incorporating technology and independence enhancing support approach results in increased quality of life increased independence and reduced lifetime care costs so highly aligned to the focus of the NDIS so let me tell you about the two projects we 've actually got off the ground so this is the building in which the first project is it 's an inner-city apartment development of 59 units a mix of public and social sorry social housing and private housing that was developed by a housing organization so there are six units in this development that are part of our first project the summer foundation owns two of those and the transport Accident Commission owns four up probably one of the most interesting parts of this is the this project was about 8 months from completion when we I 'm interested in the properties so it was all the shell of the building was there so it was quite a challenge but we decided because it is so hard to get projects up but to actually have a project and really try and run with it and get it up despite some of those sort of challenges was was worth doing and that has proved the case because we 've actually got a case site now from which we can learn and build the knowledge and we 've also been able to say yes yes you can do it so this is the second project and this is in a mixed residential commercial private development with over a hundred residential units in the Hunter region in the ndis trial site there the that 's not there yet that building construction is just starting on that site we 've completion due at the end of next year so we have worked with a private developer who has development which we 're very pleased to have been able to find someone who 's been prepared to do that with us so what we 're planning here is 10 units for people with a disability and one unit as a staff support base and there 'll be a mixture of sizes in the units there there are two units that 1.5 bedrooms so a full bedroom and I sort of study sleep over area six units that are two bedroom and two three-bedroom units to provide the opportunity potentially for families to stay to to stay together so here 's going on one of the things that 's coming through what we 're really coming to the conclusion about is location location location is just such a foundation for setting up these models and one of the key questions I think you know that will be asked in the NDIS and we 're asking ourselves is what contribution does location make to reduction in long-term care costs and how then can you weigh up the equation if you need to spend more because the location is slightly more costly does that work in this new world and by central location and this is a theme that 's come through the other two speakers near shops near services accessible transport and recreation facilities and what that means is that that people don 't need to catch taxis to visit the bank it 's not a hassle to get out and do your normal your normal stuff you need to do it 's just outside your door it 's just down the road so you don 't have the I suppose the Disney incentives of the difficulty of doing that and you also don 't just have the support costs that you might need to do that if you had to go a long way or the transport costs and the experience coming out of the evaluation of our first project is that is actually confirming that the good location is supporting people access their local community so just to talk briefly about the target group for these projects they 're basically young people who are in aged care facilities or who are at risk of being placed there so they late onset disabilities so they 're mostly people like you and I where something 's gone wrong which is always an interesting framework to think about when you 're planning services because it 's about what would you want what would you want if it 's you or it was one of your children or friends a very different frame sometimes to what we use we think about disability housing and support services and while our demonstration projects are focused on this group it 's pretty evident that some of the things that we 're learning will be relevant to quite a large group of of people with disabilities that 's just to give you a shot so let 's talk about design the design objectives that that underpin what we 're doing is Universal Design functional and adaptable meeting platinum level of the liver all housing design guidelines and we 've just actually had our plans for the New South Wales project approved and got their stamp as meeting the Platinum level guidelines so we 're very pleased about that planning for potential 40 years of use by a next door and using mainstream products as much as possible and also robust design because particularly with wheelchairs issues of damage and maintenance costs and it starts to look tacky are really important so looking at you know you 're full of board walls instead of plaster so it 's more robust nice corner guards not the gray metal steel things but things that are very discreet and look like you put them there deliberately because they 're a feature and also have resale or rental potential on the open market so these are sort of challenges we 've set ourselves with the design the other I suppose aspect of this is particularly an apartment building is needing to be involved early in the design because it 's not only what you 're doing your unit it 's actually also what happens in the whole the whole building so it 's around being able to influence common area design such as access and draws believe it 's the corridor widths and also two parking spaces so we 've been learning a fair bit about design from our first project is panic and so in a second project we 've really focused on getting far greater adaptability into the design because we 've really learned that everyone 's different and that if you really want to support independence it 's the fine detail of design that will enable you to make the difference and that is if someone 's transfers right or left if you don 't have the whole unit set up to manage that then it 's really really difficult some you know someone can approach the kitchen bench from a certain angle but not from another if you haven 't designed to be able to do that then you 're really limiting the possibilities for that person to be as independent as possible so given that you usually don 't know who 's going in and the same person isn 't going to stay across the 40 years this whole area is really real importance and it 's still you know it 's still an area where there 's a lot of work that needs needs to be done and when we need to understand costing impacts so second a second project so what we 've done in the kitchens is a design where we can have variable Heights capacity to easily move or replace under bench cabinetry so we 're not designing them as you would your standard disability unit with everything pulled out we 've got options to leave them in or not depending on the person 's needs and a moveable kitchen bench that can sit there is an island bench but can also be secured through having a power point in the floor now one of the things we 've learned is in apartment buildings you only get one go at it if you don 't get that in when it 's built it 's a very costly process or it 's going to look really tacky to add on so all the time it 's think you 've got to be the front of the game rather than the back of been doing a lot of retrofitting in apartment buildings because it is so difficult to change some of the structure the bathrooms all with all the walls are reinforced walls so you grab rails in until we knew the person going in there toilets without a change to the plumbing we 're going to be able to move them to the left or the right and replace the disabled toilet with a normal toilet without it 's just a small change to some of the some joinery and also a hard adjustable vanity unit it 's another feature with wardrobes and this was particularly around who you know people need to wheel in one way or stronger on one side of their body than the other some modular joinery that we can move to suit individuals capacities and preferences quite easily so moving on to the technology in the first project the the range of technology we 've got is emergency alerting capability which is either through a button on the wall the very traditional nurse call system a pendant which is also a very traditional thing or through an iPad a button on a knife we 've also built-in ability for communication with staff via a two-way speaker system that 's hands-free so once the tenant alerts the staff that they the microphones that are in the ceiling and the person can talk back to them we 've also incorporated a range of home automation technology which is lighting control air conditioning control blinds automated doors and sensors as required and they 're controlled by an iPad or or any sort of tablet or as much a smartphone and the other thing that we 've done more recently is put in an infrared control for the lift operation so it took nearly a year in the planning and coordination but we have one person who for a range of reasons can 't_''_969.82 control the lift buttons and this now has enabled him to move in and he 's got a little keypad with nine buttons and it can do every function on a lift very safely on that and we understand that from the lift company it was the first time it 's been done to one of the modern lifts but that made the difference between someone being able to move into this development or not so it 's it 's fairly big stakes in terms of what you can because we 're in too gimmicky stuff it really has reinforced for us that some of the assumptions we have made are actually quite correct it actually gives people privacy and control over their environment they can close their doors they can close their blinds they can turn their lights on they can turn their heating on without having to bother anyone else ask anyone else or take anyone elses needs into account or wait for staff to be there they 've got a sense of safety and security they can alert someone in an emergency but they don 't need a staff person within the whole time they know that if they need someone they can let them know that they need them it reduces the reliance on staff so that who can start to think about how they want to live and the timing and the way in which they want to go about their daily routines and the evaluation indicates that home automation supports a sense of Independence and control so it actually reinforces for people you can start to come back into control of your life supporter to calm that there are ways in which you can live the sort of life you might have dreamed of and there are people that would not be able to live independently without that the technology they would always need other people to do things for them if they couldn 't operate that their basic you know features of their house through the technology so some of the learnings to date on this but in fact their while there 's a range of mainstream technology available there 's no actually off-the-shelf program that gives us everything we need so it 's it 's a bit of a challenge we 're moving from the experience of the first project into the second project and will be very interesting to see how far we get in being able to almost push the market in in terms of being able to bring products together or to demonstrate how we brought products together to deliver the outcomes we need the other really big lesson is making sure what 's reliably from the start to clear the emergency communication system for some people moving out and shut the door and they 're fully on their own is a pretty freaky freaky time and if the systems don 't work for them it doesn 't give me confidence so that we 've learned you 've just got to have that right from the beginning you need flexibility and capability to change the monitor and and monitor easily so we now in our current system we 've got to go back to the technologies to change the temperature settings or some of the parameters in our next project we 're really looking at how the support staff might would be able to do that really easily so that it becomes a much more integrated part of the service thinking about what are we need with this person and also in discussion again it also means you can turn temperature sensors off when people go away on holiday so you don 't have alerts going off 40 degree day you need capacity for customization of the individuals that 's a you know partly about the devices they use because people have different capacities and while we haven cognitive issues we do have a couple with some mild cognitive issues and we 're learning about you know what you need to do to make it workable for them so it 's not confusing it 's important to understand long-term maintenance issues and again who 's going to fund them and how do you you know how do you line that up with with our new funding model for the future and the other interesting issue is the role of the support provider this is the tenancy and property manager in maintaining and being responsible for the technology where does it sit in the system and how do you get the right incentives in there to not have it fall into disrepair and no one 's interested because it 's a hassle how do you how do you set up the incentives and the way set it up so it 's an ongoing understanding and the importance of keeping the system working we 're working on that one so the support model focus is really important in this model and I think there 's been some messages coming through beautiful build all the good technology but if you don 't have a support model that actually works with a focus of supporting people to live their own lives to be responsible for their independence and to make sure you don 't take over doing what they can do you 're not going to get the outcomes you want so in the Melbourne project an ecto is the support provider one of the one of the contributions they made to the model was saying that we really needed intensive transition support and so that 's been done through a community inclusion facilitation role and what that role focuses is on is really getting people well before they move their to get their head into how life could be different I think I believe their life in this new place where things are different which is a bit hard to imagine sometimes for people who 've been in a nursing home or shared supported calm but unless you work with the person to change their own headspace and expect a they 're actually not going to make the best use of role and that 's continuing beyond when they 've moved in to continue to go back you know sort of an just check how they 're going with continuing to work on their plans for independence and what support they might need to do that part of that and part of support approach is tenant capability building so problem solving planning for living decision-making accountability and community linking as well as supporting as much practical independence as as possible and just one of the examples of supporting you know a range of these things was that that an actor actually worked out a process for the people to be part of the process for selection of the staff that we 're going to be engaged to provide support it sets some real challenges in place for HR practices and everything but they actually managed to work a process where three of the four people that were in those units at at that time were they 're an active participant in the actual interview process which was a very empowering and also a good learning experience for all the professionals involved more independently is key this is a model focused on supporting people 's independence so it best suits those who really want to do that and that 's really really important it 's critical to have capacity to evolve the support model an approach there was very high anxiety in the first three months and a greater focus on all the core things that you would expect that 's now shifting there was also an adjustment to the 24 hour support arrangements from basically a bright staff to now sleep over staff and you were thinking what 's the next series of adjustments that might be possible so very quickly in less than a year looking at how people gain confidence you understand the people living there how you can start to shift some of the support models and frameworks but there is a challenge of maintaining a concerted focus on tenant capability building everyone wants to help someone so how 's this model fit with the NDIS and can it fit and so what where we 've come to the view it it 's exceedingly consistent with the NDIS some thinking about fit with an individualized funding approach it 's really important to say this is not a new version of a shared supported upon model very very different in its foundation and it 's thinking it 's a model of individual homes people have normal tenancy agreements their units are a spread through the apartment development net apart from a wider door which no one notices until you pointed out they 're ordinary ordinary units spread through this so but how do you then use the opportunities of having them all in one one location you know in an apartment block to get some efficiencies these are just some of the questions that we 're about to start to work on with the ndia we 've had we 've had some early discussions but now the rubbers going to have to hit the road so what options are there to package up various interrelated elements will the ndia fund adaptation of units for specific individuals during the final stages of a building program how can we develop a framework for funding the cost of the emergency communication system the user cost of capital and whenever that paper comes out fund some of the costs of purchasing the units and then there there 's also a series of issues around the support model which I won 't go into so just in conclusion this model is is one of a range of ways to fill current gaps we 're not saying it 's the only way but it is one one of the ways of filling some of the gaps that are pretty evident out there for people with higher support needs it 's it it really is a time of opportunity and we do need to know what it takes to develop new sustainable models before we slip back into more of the same because we know it and we think that 's more cost-effective we don 't yet know how cost-effective this is so we need to give those new models a chance to actually prove or or not that they can actually deliver outcomes but it will mean some different investments we already know that the approach is able to change people 's lives and aspirations we 're working with so four out of the six have social events for family and friends to stay over that was never possible in whatever they lived before and they do stay over it 's not a non aspiration it happens they 're doing things that others themselves now that others always do for them and some are now moving from thinking about the basics you know the safety the care that how am I going to get fed to volunteering work and new relationships pretty spectacular changes in less than 12 months for some of those people just in terms of the next phase so the thing the things that we 're working on are working out the fit with the NDIS individual funding continuing the examination of social financing options for the funding of the capital and achieving more integrated flexible and robust technology approaches so do we want to though this is just a DVD that was done around the technology to give you a bit of a sense but also look at the actual physical building behind it cuz it 's done in one of you with this morning move okay well you have a great day I 'll probably see you later on today bye how are you Griffin oh you in aid of a coffee come with me oh geez grandma Thank You Astrid that 's fantastic and I think the video was great as well too to give us a representation of what the lived experience of that technology would be _"

    "text": "a lot of people take us to like to come to the director the director general come to community consultation people come in and they say if we 're really lucky they 'll say and what 's more it 's so good and we believe in it so much we actually drafted the legislation straight away and really this conversation is around that we don 't have a monopoly on good ideas there 's other reasons around just we know and it 's the issue certainly when I started in the public service we were much we seem to have a much more depth and they would be so in toward my areas for actually two different branches and there were people there who had spent their whole lives on particular topic area we just don 't have any so I used to remember about the context is we are an island in the middle of New South Wales so things that New South Wales does impact on us it will go from New South Wales and really the where I go to my ministry one of my ministers and get is what is New South Wales do and quite often the second question is what does the Northern Territory or 29 YouTube and the reason we get that is the second question is there are the small jurisdictions so there are some things that we wouldn 't doing the ICT because population New South Wales has really excellent we are Australia has regular across regular national meetings where legislative proposals will be considered and there are some things that really benefit from having the same laws across Australia some people would like the same laws across Australia for everything I can 't see it taking off all states have particular interests sectional interests so anyway we certainly look at we get on the bandwagon for harmonized legislation things like like road rules it makes sense that everybody that when it wherever you 're driving in Australia you have the same rules apply to you there are small exceptions on that though we 're also a territory subject to Commonwealth law so territories are territories are recognized in the Australian Constitution but really the Australian Constitution is an agreement between it talks about states powers we are actually the territories of creation of the Commonwealth so we are established by a Commonwealth act and that sets out a lot of the laws sets out a lot of the rules around how we operate so for example because we 're a subordinate entity until 2011 our laws could actually be disallowed by an executive act of the federal government so they could say no say to the governor-general No disallow that and that could work within a certain time frame can 't_''_375.08 do it now the other thing is because of the self-government act there are some things we can 't do so we can 't execute people if we were going to go there we can 't I 'm sorry and we can 't make euthanasia laws things like that another way that the ICT is different from the states is that we only have two layers of government so we 've got the state powers and the local government powers rolled into one so this can make things more complicated and really it kind of means that we 're legislators like the New South Wales government doesn 't do the things like look after the roads and things quite as much as we do so it 's it just means we cover more a while back there was a report called it 's the Hulk report governing the city-state and really what it said it looked at the way we operate and it said actually guys it didn 't quite set in these terms but it said you 're a mile wide and an inch thick and really what you 're trying to do is a lot of things and when you try and do a lot of things and there 's not a lot of you you don 't really hit hit the mark as much what you should do is work out what your priorities are and focus on them which makes good sense the issue is I think that along with having priorities as a government we also need to meet the needs of the community and if you have a problem and you have the problem today if I say to you when you bring 't on my priority list that doesn 't make you happy so what we need to do is work out a way to be responsive focus on our priorities and still hit as many marks as we can so um when Robert said you can ask questions you can ask questions I did put a slide at the end that said ask questions but if I 'm not making sense I 'm sorry next if I 'm not making sense talk to me it does happen I have teenagers I 'm used to feedback okay this is a picture of the Westminster system a couple of things so your traditional Westminster system is has two houses where a unicameral system so the Legislative Assembly is the single house you would think that would make it easier to get legislation through I don 't think so so really in the time since self-government there has only been one single party majority government and so I think it was three or four years I think it might have been three years so what that means is that there 's a lot of need to have two parties agree to it usually so at the moment there is labor greens government previously they 've been independents have held the balance of power and there have been minority governments okay Westminster system we have a cabinet process so ministers can 't go off and there are some things that the executive can do let 's take a step back there are three parts of government there 's the executive the legislature and judiciary thank you the judiciary or mine say I shouldn 't have forgotten ooh okay really what it 's about it 's about balance so the executive can take certain action so there are things like making regulations which are subordinate laws but they can 't make the the big laws and the big decisions they can they can come to the Legislative Assembly through a cabinet process and put laws through that way but that has to get the agreement of the they just assembly the reason that there 's a separation of powers and like a Westminster system is really about balance and it 's about making sure that processes one place because of the Westminster system separation of powers the judiciary has independence so we have independent courts so there 's independence around judgments it also ties in with independence of prosecutors so we get a lot of letters and a lot of feedback around particular court cases and things like that the legislature shouldn 't be involved in that the legislature should set up the set up the system but really just to stop the legislature getting the power to actually say well how its laws operate apart from their broad terms the judiciary judges makes judgments on that and says how it will operate so it 's the balancing again and we really don 't make laws for individuals we make them for the system as a whole okay next it 's good it 's gets into they 're balancing again you 've come up with your light bulb it 's beautiful it 's awesome and it 's it 's so inescapably right and you can 't understand why I 'm not immediately doing something to legislate it the issue is that rights affect other rights and very few things in life that I completely write one way so I was at a meeting last week and we were proposing something to a group of informed stakeholders they had a particular it was around courts and they all knew about the area and we said we 're looking at doing this and somebody actually said well you know that 's obvious why don 't you just do it why are you even talking to us and the person next to us turned around and said because I think it 's the wrong thing to do so it 's even even in areas where the stakeholders know each other and know the areas there are divergent views and really it 's our part as as the public service to balance rights and to take views and to make an informed decision and really this is where the community is important because we don 't have the lived experience of how things operate we don 't have the lived experience of what it 's like to go through systems but we do have a broader picture and we do rights affecting other rights if you look at the Human Rights Act pretty much so there 's really this there 's two rights that you can 't you can 't change alter detract from but all the rest you can and that 's because there 's a recognition that one person 's rights will affect another person 's rights and the Human Rights Act again is around balance the Human Rights Act is a decision-making tool so it won 't stop us from making it 's making a decision needing doing something that we need to do what it will do is make sure that where that decision will affect impact on particular rights personal rights we 've gone through a good process and it 's around evidence that 's around balance that 's around appropriateness and it 's around doing the thing that 's least restrictive so really what the Human Rights Act does is it helps us decide whether we really need to do the thing that we want to do and really that goes back to having an evidence base we really need an evidence base we to do we do them because we have an evidence base because it 's not clear what the right thing to do is and what that will come through is probably that the best way to describe that is what 's the problem we 'll we 'll what we 're proposing fix it how often does it happen how proportioned it is it are we using something that 's quite large to solve quite a small problem will there be a sort of collateral damage that sort of thing so really it 's going through its got really going through good governance and good decision-making processes I guess the other thing that is always we certainly always think about is decisions that we make around what to propose to the minister are going to have an impact on Texel usually quite often are going to either impact the community or cost the community money and it 's taxpayers money and we have to think about that so we have we get quite repeated calls for things that might cost a lot of money and and really we 're not going are alternatives we 'll go through them and that might take time to get us an evidence base next please so this is one of these things is not like the other really I would just wanted to give you two examples to sort of demonstrate the real-life application of this one of the best one of the best indicators of whether something will work in the ICT is whether it 's already working in somewhere else this is not infallible one of the things we put in back in the early 2000s was a right to trial by judge alone and that came in because there was a perception that they were quite complicated cases around sort of finances of like fraud where perhaps the jury wouldn 't understand and there was didn 't happen in all the jurisdictions across Australia but certainly there was I think we adopted the South Australian model and that worked really well and it reduced the impact on meant that they weren 't retrials where juries came up with basically couldn 't decide and things like that what what happened in the a in South Australia forever was we went to a situation where in South Australia and in other jurisdictions there was between 10 and 20% of trials were going to judge alone in the a CT it was more than double that and what we were getting was a skewing of the way people used the courts because of that so it we can 't always predict what the effect of what we 're doing will be even if we 've got a live example in Australia where you think it should apply the other thing I were to other example I wanted to give you was around bail reform so this is another one where it was obvious what the problem was so we had a problem with bail what happened was people were coming to the magistrate 's court for a bail application getting knocked back appealing to the Supreme Court getting bail and this was leading to the Supreme Court because people didn 't want to go to the magistrate 's court because you 've always got a rubbish result and people wanted to go to the Supreme 's court and the Supreme Court when we actually looked at it the solution was to make people have a second application at the magistrate 's court stage so two two applications of that as of right because previously you could only apply once the issue was that when you get arrested the first thing you want to do is get out of jail so people would straightaway apply for bail but they wouldn 't have all their information they wouldn 't have a good case that it was it was almost a gut reaction by making them have a second application at the magistrate 's court stage which was the stage that they 've previously been going to the Supreme Court the magistrate 's court got to decide on what the Supreme Court had previously been deciding on and they actually there were a lot more bail applications being granted I think the reason I wanted to share that one with you is if somebody had said we 've got too many bail at too many bail appeals to the Supreme Court let 's make people go to that seem intuitive but in fact it 's worked really well and when you look at the numbers we 've weighed spinning for about two years 3s and the numbers are looking really good and it 's it 's led to people people applying for bail at the right time at the right place I guess there are only a couple of other things around the ICT about us being different special so one is we have a lot of we have a population profile we have a lot of younger people and that will have implications for some things the other thing that sometimes we don 't think about and certainly we do think about in crime prevention space is indicators of poverty socio-economic indicators in the acct are quite masked so because of a policy way back you don 't tend to get poor suburbs you tend to get suburbs with a variety of people across them and that makes it harder to do some things that in other jurisdictions have been easier where you 've actually targeted particular areas and we have a lot of hidden disadvantage so 's really what I wanted to say I hope that 's kind of giving you an indication of why things are not always as obvious as think they should be and hopefully and and that there are checks and balances through the system that something that I think might be a good idea or you might think might be a good idea we might not have enough of the picture to be able to make an assessment thank you very much Julie yeah yeah and and totally hear you really what other jurisdictions do is is a factor so that when we make a decision about going forward if no one else has done at least we know that we 're trailblazing and that our mistakes are our own so again it 's about balancing what the political appetite is at a particular time and and what resources we have to put into things but no I totally agree and we do we do do things that other jurisdictions don 't do and we are looking at Scandinavian countries are really excellent around law reform and that sort of thing question was doing the A 's with New South Wales around proposals and initiatives because we were in Ireland within New South Wales so the answer is that we we do a bit of it we probably don 't do as much as we we couldn 't we could always do more but we could always do more consultation on everything certainly there are a number South Wales has been around a lot longer than the ICT it has a lot of really good programs and we 're really not averse to stealing ideas sorry borrowing using so we certainly there 's a big initiative we 're working on at the moment that we 've pretty much talked to New South Wales from day one and they 're our kind of Mentor or murdered friend on that so so the question was any advice on if you find areas for improvement for law how you can get that message through to government you can write to ministers you can write directorates there 's the time to talk website there 's a whole lot of community consultations around so feel free directorates that 's probably a useful way if it 's something that 's sort of more low-key and what we actually find is that it 's it 's the small things that make a big difference to people 's lives so things that just aren 't working right and it might just be something small that we could sort of pop into a bill or something like that so yeah right talk to us bring us even depending when you 're weighing the evidence how much does the financial that 's a it 's a tricky question it kind of depends whether it 's a proposal or an initiative that already has funding if so that ties into budget proposals so later this year there 'll be the ICT government will put up an invitation for people to make budget proposals and that sort of thing so if you 've got a proposal that has a budget implications certainly use the community consultation which differ you will talk about sorry look it 's really hard to tell we wouldn 't go we don 't go for a Rolls Royce model really don 't have the size to do that I don 't_''_1644.22 I don 't it 's always a consideration but it will actually probably depend on the particular case so sorry I can 't_''_1652.51 be more helpful in it I don 't believe so I think it 's the Commonwealth has responsibility for jobs BAE and we we I think we currently provide services that Jeffrey might have a better idea on that one common territory of which they complete the service pay to deliver some services so we need to revamp its protection services very unique situation we 'll sell it to if you 're interested any other questions for Julie no yes I guess it 's all about which perspective you have I 'm really happy to hear that we 're the jam in the donut is so close thank you _"

    "text": "introduced soon Chapman now as the next speaker sue is the deputy director-general of the community services Directorate and so she 'll be able to give you a perspective from a line agency thank you thank you and thank you julie for taking my slot because in my diary i was hit due to be here at ten thirty and not at ten o 'clock and i was actually chairing a meeting so thank you very much for doing that i was hoping there somebody else here thank you for the invitation and the topic is the perspective the perspective from a line agency I 'm from Community Services Directorate and I 've been involved in line agencies in other jurisdictions I worked in the public health system in New South Wales of the allura Area Health Service I worked for the infamous docs in New South Wales earlier in my career and I 've also worked in policy agencies as well so I I guess I 've got a bit of perspective from from both sides the other thing that I 've been involved with which lots of you or NGOs and for a while I was on the lake illawarra authority as a community representative which involved me and my colleagues or 10 of us academics council members and so on arguing the toss with the new south wales state government about how lake illawarra could be improved and and trying to get money for that so i had to find out quite quickly how is a community person i could influence decisions in the government of the day so I 've got a range of perspectives I guess the thing that I wanted to start with though is in a line agency as a bureaucrat we have responsibilities to the government the government of the day sets the policy that 's why they were elected they 're there to run in this case the territory and even if you didn 't personally vote for who 's in power you voted in a democratic process to have a government to make decisions for the greater good for the public good and so our role as a line agency is to deliver on the policy and on the decisions that we sit and splendid isolation and wait for something to come over the parapet from the government and they say here you are could you do something with that place where heavily involved in informing policy decisions and so one of our important roles in this is to actually work in our service system across the whole of the server system which is government parts of the service system non-government parts of the service system and private parts of the service system if they exist in that particular service system so one of the really important things as a line agency that we need to do is to work with and across all of the government so across all of the directorate 's that we have anything to do with in relation to that service system and with the sector and that 's the people sitting in this room people say to me sometimes yes but the power relationships different you have all the power because you hold the money and the reality is very often we do because we fund services that the government wants to have delivered the best decisions that are possible it behooves us to involve all of the people who actually have to make a work on the ground so our way of informing policy is to get in really early in the front end when somebody 's having a good idea when we can we try to do that we say the same thing to you if you 've got an idea involve us early because we can talk about how it might be able to be happening but we say to our policy partners well that 's a fabulous idea that if you go down this particular part it 's probably going to be impossible to implement or it 's going to be very expensive to implement or you 're not going to get the outcomes that you want or it 's a fabulous idea and we 're right there with you so the debate that has to happen in terms of the development of policy involves not people sitting in you know rooms thinking up policy ideas and doing some research and then plunking down a cabinet submission is actually talking to achieve the outcomes that that policy setting is all about and so part of our role is to bring your views and your experience as Julie says your lived experience into that discussion and we need to find ways to do that the interesting thing for me is that often when we 're having those conversations we appear to be in a total odds it 's like everybody 's in there having a fight you know it 's my way or the highway or I want I want to win Julie 's concept of balancing can I say I loved her slides I mean I don 't have any she 's really good but the concept of balance balancing competing priorities competing stakeholders competing expectations and all of those kinds of things often means that people see the outcome are through a lens that says there 's a winner or there 's a loser now governments are about the public good they 're there for the whole population they might deep dive occasionally to look at a particular subset of that population to do something specific because maybe they I mean the NDIS is a classic example of getting really focused on a particular demographic in our in our community and really focusing on that during a huge amount of work in that space but there 's a big lot of them it 's not about a bunch of individuals it 's about that the group of people whose lives can be improved overall if we do something with the policy settings that are there what I wanted to say was if we 're actually going to be able to inform policy development and deliver good quality efficacious service on the ground to the communities and people that we serve we should be starting from the point of view that we all agree on one thing and the one thing in my view working having worked across a range of service delivery agencies is that we 're all working in human services and those kinds of services because we actually want to make a difference to the population that we serve so that 's why I 'm in human services that 's why I think most of you are in service delivery land we want to make a difference so if we agree that our starting point as always to do something that 's going to improve outcomes for that group of people we 're halfway along the discussion I think so one of the things that I 'd say from my observations are now I 'm really old I have lots and I could bore you witless with them but I 'll stick the time is that in any work that we do in these kinds of policy and service delivery Continuum 's in the human services area the success of it of whatever the outcome is will be based on how good is our relationship because it is based on relationships we can talk about process of which there 's huge numbers and all talk briefly about that in a minute and there are rules and at the end of the day we are public servants that 's our part of the service system and we have responsibilities that we need to meet which you might go oh for God 's sake get a grip well that you have responsibilities in your areas to your boards or to the volunteers you work with thought and the clients that you deal with but at the end of the day if we have a good relationship and things get a bit tough and we have to make difficult decisions based on data and evidence and you 're all my or somebody else 's fabulous idea that they really really love and really wanted to get up doesn 't get up it shouldn 't damage the relationship and it shouldn 't mean that we can 't continue to have discussions about other things so one of the one of the things that I think is really important from a service line agent service delivery line agency point of view is maintaining developing and maintaining relationships with people so that if I have to say no I 'm sorry that 's not going to happen for these reasons or for no reason sometimes because there might be some secret cabinet thing happening that I 'm allowed to tell anybody about I would hope that you would trust me disabled she just decided to say no today there 's usually a good reason for it behind behind the know or if I say well that 's a fantastically good idea I think we could work it up but it might need to look like this or it might need to fit into this other thing that 's moving along there 's a good reason for that too so the relationship and and one that 's based on trust and recognizing that even friendships sometimes have sticky periods where you don 't want to have a cup of tea with them because they 're really annoying you that 's okay because that 's like being an adult the thing that I would say about getting a decision an idear up is Canberra cracks me up i mean i come from New South Wales and I 'm forever struck about really how small camper is because everybody knows everybody as my staff say there 's always a backstory Sue and you just need to know before you go out and start shooting off your mouth you bump into you your local member or a did when i was doing my laps at dixon pool in summer i came up at the end and there was a minister looking at me in the end of my lane you know I 'm looking really attractive in my goggles on my hat prime minister I 'm not sure what you 're supposed to call a minister when you 're in the pool at Dixon but anyway that 's a fantastic thing in many respects it 's a really great thing because you get to hear really like immediately stuff when I work for the department of human services as a federal public servant I was in this fabulously isolated glass tower out at Tuggeranong I never saw anybody I never went to lunch I never knew anything about anything and I was working on all of this stuff that was about Family Policy families policy your hope it has an impact somewhere you 'd like to think it would and if you ever actually saw a real person you might be able to ask them in Canberra you can do that every day now that often means shops you know I didn 't like the answer from that particular part of the organization or that particular Directorate I think I 'll go and have a go down here the bottom line is if you are in the community want something to be put on the agenda or you 're concerned about something or you want something changed or whatever it happens to be it will always get back to the minister with the portfolio so even if it 's your local member down at the IGA if they think it 's something that should be raised it will end up with portfolio minister and in our case we have four so you know we know all the ministers just about including the treasure and here 's an important person to know they 'll that person that Member of Parliament or that other minister will say to my Minister if it 's say it 's in community services as an example what do you think about this idea or this was raised with me and could you get somebody to have a look at it it will always minister it is very rare probably not unheard of but really rare for a minister on the basis of a conversation at the pool at Dixon with a constituent will come back into the assembly next week and propose a new policy setting usually doesn 't happen like that it will be minister will say this give us some thoughts on this give us some options where does is feared how might this work bloody blur and there 's a conversation so we 're always in the mix as the public servants so if you have a you know the light bulb moment or that you 're your pet thing that you think this this could actually make a really big difference in what we 're doing but it will mean certain things get changed and might be a legislative change or it might be a reshaping of a program that you 're funded for in a particular way now to turn it into something else but it 's going to get better outcome talk to us talk to the line agencies or talk to the policy agencies as well this fit in that bigger context that we 're working in it 's important for us to have those conversations so we understand what it is you are trying to achieve where you think there could be a better outcome for the for the money that we have the other thing that I 'd say just speaking of money is in this really isn 't much of it about the pie is not getting exponentially bigger the pie is probably getting smaller and if you look at what 's happening with the Commonwealth we 're going to have big impacts probably in the acct because of that so one of the ways of actually getting a good idea up or changing direction is to say i don 't want more money for it I want to use this funding that you 've given me in a different way for these reasons based on this evidence and so on and that 's the same thing we have to do if we think a particular policy setting a particular program a particular whatever isn 't actually delivering the outcomes we want we and back to the government the process is the same either way I think the other thing that it 's always really important to remember is ministers and members of the assembly and ministers and their advisers are there the politics there the politicians and the political advisors ministers will get their advisers from time to time to do some research on something often they ask us but they can do that but that has a political slant that isn 't my business my business is to look at the policy that the government has set and makes sure we can deliver on it to get the outcomes we want within budget in a timely way and so on and so forth so there are two parts to any service delivery or policy debate there 's the political part and then there 's the policy bureaucratic part good segue into bureaucracy I know that people in the sector have said you know there 's too much bureaucracy and we have to fill out too many forms and we have to report too often and the things don 't make sense of money and you know all of those things now Roberts doing great work in trying to improve that for you but one of the things that I would say is because we are in government and we are spending the public purse we are accountable to the public for the what we 've done with their money and so the levels of transparency and accountability we have are actually much higher than they probably are anywhere else in any organization whether it 's bluescope and small non government or whatever we have scrutiny like you cannot believe and so everything we do has to you know has to fit we have to report in a particular way we have to to be very very very clear about what it is we 're doing and how we 're doing it with whom we 're doing it and what the outcomes are so sometimes we have to get you to give us information because we 've bought the service from you you 're delivering it on be on our behalf but we have to report in that way where we can the day there are some things that are not strip out a ball and the other thing is because we get a lot of our revenue from the Commonwealth that the territory does we are actually beholden to them as well and they have a series of expectations about what data will provide and so on which again we might have to get from you to give to them because they give us money so happy to have the conversation about how we could make it simpler or more effective but understand that at some at some point there 's a place we can 't go because of the rules of working in the environment we working I guess the only other thing that I 'd say is the importance of data and and evidence in service delivery we see you see I see immediately the impact of some of the stuff that we do now it 's not enough to write a proposal based on some anecdotes that you know somebody said and Mary Smith her mum had this experience that 's not evidence based policy setting or service work we need evidence we need to get people to give us real live data that says something about the topic or the issue that we 're trying to address sometimes it 's easy easier to get than others but it is surprising how much information is actually out there and how simply if we actually knew where to look we could get it we in CSD had a session with our senior managers a couple of weeks ago half-day session which we called day today and we talked with Department of Human Services who earned a big Centrelink worrying machine of all of the data that they have in administrative data that we could find out stuff from if we ask the right questions and then we looked internally and realized we had absolutely bucket loads of data that we 've also collected that we haven 't interrogated in particular ways that will also help us so data and evidences is really important and and the understanding the demographics of where we 're working in the acct is also important Julie 's right that there aren 't giant you scattered throughout the whole of the whole of the territory so we need to look at our service delivery models with that kind of information in mind I think the the last thing I would say is that and i want to quote minister gentleman when he talked to the sector leaders forum last week he said something along the lines and I should know because I approved the speech that the system will change the sector will look different in five years or ten years and it will because we know things are changing we know people have higher expectations of government we know that there are big policy changes coming over the over the horizon the NDIS is an absolutely monumental change to the human services service system the expectations of the people with a disability for what their futures hold under this new arrangement are really significant and that will have a downstream impact on what are the services that are provided who are the organizations that are working in the acct what do they look like I mean the minister said there will always be diversity there are organizations who decided to join up together to provide a continuum of service in a way they 'd never thought possible before so we have to understand that change is inevitable and the fact that you or we have been doing this thing this way for 20 years whatever it is isn 't going to change is like putting a head in the sand and so those are the conversations that we need to have and that 's what as a line agency we should be leading in many respects because we actually have to change the way we deliver services in many cases because we can either can 't afford to continue them the way they are all the populations change or the government has set a different policy which has a an impact federal government I mean an impact that we hadn 't anticipated so we 've got a different cohort of people coming to us all of those things will make something look different and the fact that we say we need to make it look different isn 't to say that what 's gone or stupid or any of those things it was the basis on which we 're going to do the next level one of the things that I wanted to end on is about decision making as I said I worked for the public health system for quite a long while in my early in my career and about 15 years after i left the Illawarra i was asked to go back to help them with a particularly stickney problem to do with buying services from the private sector because the public system just couldn 't cope and we had to negotiate a way of doing that and it was going nowhere and when I 'd come in when I came in I think the hospital had been at it for about 12 months and everybody was exercising everybody hated each other 's guts and every time they got into a room everybody went bright red and nothing happened and they left it 's kind of like Russia in the Ukraine you know that kind of was about that level and and what was happening his services weren 't being provided things that I did was to sit down with all of the records because you know good public servants we keep eons of records to understand how we got to where we were what were the issues and I remember reading a particular brief with that went to the board of the day you know 15 years before or something and as I was reading us and oh my god who was stupid person who said that did the board and I turned it over and had my signature on it now I used that story because at the time 15 years before based on what was happening you know what was expectations who was in government because the government had changed twice since then you know blah de blah that was the right decision for that time moving on 15 years I 'm going are you nuts like and then I had to keep himself so because it was me so what I 'm saying is sometimes decisions will be made policy settings will be established programs will be funded but sometime down the track they don 't fit changed so one of the things that I would encourage you to do and we do it too because often in non CSD people say I invented that thing you know like I 've been in the CSD for 30 years and this was my baby will go you know it 's lovely let 's have a cake do something else it 's okay when we have to change something that is not a statement about the usefulness of it for the last 30 years so when we do talk about that again please don 't don 't think that it 's because we 're actually having a different conversation at a subterranean level about the work that 's been done because we 're not so as a lion agency we have to work really closely with the people in our service system which could be other government government directorates but it 's often and probably more times than not the people in this room it is important to have a relationship built on trust and the reality sometimes you will be told no sometimes I 'm told no I or maybe two and then I 'll get on with it my job is to serve the government of the day your job is to serve your the constituents that you serve and to inform us and so we can inform the government of things that need to be done that 's the partnership so there 's a whole cabinet process which I 'm sure Jeffrey will talk to you about which means we rewrite briefs a thousand times and they go in and out in and out and in and out of the minister 's officers and so there is a whole internal kind of world of writing that we have to do as public servants again to have transparency but at the end of the day from where I 'm sitting it 's about having good conversations to inform the work that we do so thank you very much for your time policy and talked about the data and evidence that knows and Julie also mentioned that but i guess the reality is that in the acct particularly public servants have a lot of power a lot of are subjected to some quite heavy duty lobbying from different interests are many of which perhaps are competing against each other for resources so I wonder if we could say a bit about about how he was a professional in this all those cons and pressures everyone hear the question it 's about public servants having lots of power in the acct I wish but you 're right because because we live in a small community we do bump into people who want to lobbyists so tell us about their good idea or the thing that they think is not right and so on and so forth I mean we have a lot of influence in in the sense that we inform the government about issues the fact that somebody sees me down at the IGA and says I think we need to do X and I might actually agree with it that might be something that we really really need to do I don 't have any authority to make that happen I don 't_''_1571.64 I mean I can go back and talk with in CSD and say this the IGA and I 'm wondering if we could build this into another program or a budget bid we 're putting up or you know something and we can talk about it and we might be able to put it in as an option or as an idea that the minister might want to consider but at the end of the day we can 't just decide to do that even things like grants programs we have not a lot of money but we have money that we can provide in grants to organizations but there 's always a process there are criteria there 's a selection team who have to make a recommendation to the delegate so it 's not something that somebody individually can do and as public servants we need to remember that I mean it 's not our money it 's the public 's money it 's the public 's program it 's the public 's whatever so lots of people do talk to me at functions and I make notes or I you know get them to send me an email so i can consider my colleagues don 't have all the good ideas lots of people have good ideas and it 's important that we have a way of hearing about those but it doesn 't mean we can automatically just because I my value set says that 's a fabulous thing we should be doing it I can actually make that happen I can enter enter the discussion and put those views forward and I can argue strongly that at the end of the day but might not get up if it gets up a mite get up in a different form or might be owned by somebody else or whatever it happens to be so I think I think that there is often a perception that public servants are much more powerful than they are there are a few public servants who are incredibly powerful that 's some you know in like utopia there 's this a new yell to who runs everything from what I can tell I think he 's an eel to he might be an eel one I don 't really know ah and a couple of his a job of work to do and we need to be and and we are held accountable for that yes interested in hearing you talk some more about consultation my dad 's a layman open multiple sclerosis organization we 're pretty small organization I 'm thinking about a couple of experiences that I 've had I guess in the past year with consultation one has been with the the NDIS and I think there was some great consultative opportunities there and it was made very very clear that there were some things that we could contribute to and some things that we couldn 't and I thought that was great and I felt that community organizations were able to make a difference in the crafting of that but I can think of another example and so with the grants program that related to health education and there was sort of a shift I think it related to what Julie said about being a mile wide and an Indian neck and there was a decision to kind of focus on some areas and there was some consultation there where I walked and because the decisions had already been learned about that so why did we bother so I 'm just interested to hear what you 've got to say about consultative process sure resources were small years look the question was a consultation processes and especially with small organizations who get well all up in camera we consult a lot about lots of things and I know that the sector is often said to me there 's too many consultations we spend our whole life having a meeting with you because you know you want us to be consulted on stuff and we do but we have to be really really sensible about that because I mean nobody can spend their whole lives in a consultation so there 's two parts to it there is there is consultation that might be very broad abroad remit and the Human Service blueprint was probably it 's probably a good example of that where we had an idea about how to join up a service system but we actually hadn 't worked out what it could look like should look like how it should to formulate that which turned into a co design effort with intensive co.design with not every person who needed to be involved they couldn 't we just said we need some good brains from the sector to think about this stuff and that 's what we did so that was consultation from right like the colonel of the idea and and we started off broad and then we got down to the pointy end and we got a half a dozen people or ten or twenty whatever it was in a room to actually think the issue through that didn 't mean we 're ignoring everybody else but there 's a look like there has to be a practicality there are some consultations which actually are not about the decision the government makes a decision and what they may wish to consult on is how to implement that decision in the most efficacious way so it might be that the decision is made so don 't ruin that don 't don 't go back over at the decisions made you know cabinet is decided the assembly is voted it 's but the next phase that we want people to be involved in often is how best to make that happen and again we don 't necessarily when I say we I mean the government and the bureaucracy don 't necessarily go in saying this is the only way we could deliver that policy outcome we 've probably got a fair idea because that 's probably what we 've costed it on when it 's gone up through the budget process but in the discussions around how to do that we can tweak it we can move it it is valuable to understand and it might not be that we can change it right now we might say well look let 's get it rolling and then we 'll do a review in 12 months will measure look at the data it has it actually had the impact or whatever and then we can tweak it again so consultation comes in lots of kind of varieties and and if you really believe as an organization in the non-gaussian just don 't have the resources to be consultant to be in the time to talk I mean Julie use time to talk Chief Minister 's took time what 's a call talk back on a Friday people ring up with all kinds of things I mean there are ways write a letter you don 't have to sit in a room for two days you could write a letter on people we could follow that up with you so there are different ways of consulting but I think it is important to understand that sometimes you are not going to be consulted on the decision say but you 're going to be consulted leading up to when the government does make a decision to get information in there and you might be consulted on once the decisions made about what we 're going to do next so think about where you put your efforts and your energies to do that any other questions yes recent like the focus on outcomes and equipment in the community sector often the impacts of what is done political time I think that 's absolutely true and I think that often a good idea it 's time I i think the data might be showing us all the evidence might be showing is something we need to start that conversation about what why is that so and and again like I say maybe tweak some of the policy settings not a radical overhaul but maybe do something different to move it along during that that time that we 've got to to to do the work but at the end of the day if a good ideas time hasn 't come I 'm a great believer of shoving it in the bottom drawer and then when the time sounds like it 's right there 's a new thing that the government wants to do a new government wants to do something sometimes you think that 's this this is a really good idea this is dusted off change the date changed the name you don 't change the color and stick it back up the cop you know the the agenda because the reality is it is a point there are political cycles there are particular things that are popular at certain times in any you know the forefront of people 's minds now outcomes are really important because often in the past we have paid for widgets you know like how many of these things went in the door I mean I use this example internally with our Learning and Development Center they tell me how many people have sat in a room and had a course and I go yeah well that 's all lovely but actually has decision-making improved the fact that we 've had you know 47 of our al ones in a room for three days learning how to make good decisions did anything improve how we measuring that what was the app that 's more important to me because we could just everybody could have a lovely time and it 's nice catering and we all go home and nothing changes yes and that 's why we are interested in you know Commonwealth data because getting getting that knowledge base can actually help inform where we going because that 's longer to do on then we can say okay we think this is the trajectory so five years out it 's doing now to shift the boat because you know government is a big ship and takes while to turn it around so don 't despair but recognize the reality yeah I mean you know there are political realities um and there are ideas who 's times need to come later on but keep that work because it 's good work usually other questions no thank you very much soon thank you thank you _"

    "text": "one of the things that Sue talked about is our relationship with you as community sector organizations and how we very frequently fund you to deliver services on our behalf and that might apply to many if not all of the organization 's here today we 're also conscious that that process the process by which funding that flows through either our own or from the Commonwealth flows through to purchase services delivered by you was considered to be one of the blackest of the blackest boxes that exists in the government so we thought we needed to do something about that one as well and that 's why we invited Dave person to talk along as I said at the start Dave purse is the director of goods and services procurement from the public work Public Works Directorate Commerce and works Directorate and he 's going to just open the lid of that really dark box shine a torch in for a little bit so that you can see what 's inside following that why think we 'll just slam it shut again because i think is best to Dave thanks Robert hi everyone I think one of the toughest challenges you could put to a debating team is to ask them to argue in the affirmative why procurement is sexy I know this is true because I see the look on people 's faces whenever they ask me what I do for a living but some well I don 't really have an expectation that procurements ever going to be sexy it does have a problem with its image and how it 's been characterized I think you know government procurement in particular has tended to be viewed as risk-averse process-driven closed and I think that 's really stemmed from a perspective that to really look at the risk in procurement on the basis of probity so you know what can go wrong is embarrassment what go wrong is that a tender evaluation outcome is contested and there 's a liability that arises from that not really a look at what is the opportunity lost when a procurement is not done well what 's the the loss to the community when we pay over the odds for things I think we 're starting to shift there and we started and by necessity perhaps sort of with money right running out reduction in revenue that sort of really driving the focus the other way so it 's really a time for procurement to reform and move on and we need to do better and we need to be better relationships with our different parts of government but most particularly with with our different providers please so first of all I was just going to briefly might be a little bit difficult to see down the back but just about where my organization sits it 's in the central arm of government so the newly amalgamated Chief Minister Treasury in economic Directorate what we do is that we do procure and manage a number of whole of governor arrangements for services such as travel flights utilities banking that sort of nature but the vast array of procurement are actually managed by the different directorates so for you generally community services they conduct the evaluation they own the budget and they 'll be the contract manager and we provide an advisory billion dollars of the four billion dollars of the ICT budget is spent on goods and services each year about third of that or 350 million is really internal payments payments grants payments to individuals to corporate entities those sorts of things of government corporate entities and 650 million or goes out to our suppliers so it 's not insignificant so I belong to the procurement capital works organization that used to be called shared services procurement and before that was called procurement solutions which might be familiar to you next please before I sort of got into some of the sort of the administrative arrangements around procurement what I did want us to discuss was what I saw as some of the saw the biggest issues that create angst around procurement and I have sort of title that conundrums and that 's perhaps not really the right word but I think in discussing member might give you a bit of a sense of the mentality or the issues within government around procurement and the things that we really need to to work on the first one which have said I sort of touched on and it 's really that that sort of perspective and balance you know I think the way things tend to operate at the moment is a business area works to develop its specification or its requirement about what it needs it sort of does that in isolation that it sends it out openly to market there 's an opportunity for you to have a look at that document only at that point you you know you might be able to ask a few clarification questions through a formal process you 'll get a fairly to the stiff limited response tenders come in no responses come in they 're evaluated again in a very to clothes isolated process and quite often in looking at those we 're sort of sitting there scratching their heads to the hanging wall this isn 't quite what we wanted or Jesus a lot more money than we thought we would have done this differently if we 'd sort of known and you know it 's it 's that you know reducing the risk of recurrent really is in making sure that otherwise you know costs other requirements get built into it and it 's really a sort of a loss for everyone so that that 's a real sort of challenge that that we need to try and manage and get the balance right the process contract so for procurement people the sort of the one case you need to understand is this Hughes Aircraft case which really enshrined that the obligation that when we set out a tender process that we have to follow the guidelines follow the process that that we set out in the evaluation so we can 't bring in other information that we didn 't say we would into that assessment and while I don 't be getting would argue that 's that 's not the right thing it does really mean that if we get that process wrong we 're sort of stuck and and I think sometimes you know where that is that is sort of the outcome and we can 't really change it on the supplier side and I think this is probably where the biggest sort of misconception happens is work for the government they know me and that 's going to somehow be pulled into it each tender is evaluated by itself so only the information that 's provided in response to the questions asked is assessed and this particularly arises when we 're renewing a service so someone that 's already a provider when we 're establishing panel contracts or get irate suppliers coming in saying how can these turkeys get on this panel we do this great job already you just ask these guys and they 've just assumed we know that whereas in fact there is an evaluation team that receives all the documents sits down looked at the response and scores it on that basis and you notice part there might be that other merit there you really need to sort of key piece of advice is when you 're responding to this request from government look at them in isolation look at the questions and make sure you respond sort of thoroughly to those and we 're welcome to yes yes that 's right so you know we have to evaluate what we said is a bit of a job for us to you know improve the way we do that so that we should be collecting you know performance information so people who are doing good job are getting rewarded next time for bit and that 's something you 're pretty touched on again as well next please the overarching so legislation around procurement is the government procurement Act defines what procurement is the valley for money principle which is sort of the the core driver for procurement decisions I 'll touch on that and also might be familiar with the requirement to publish contracts so all notifiable contracts broadly contracts over 25,000 must within 21 days of contract execution be put up on our on our website within that and that 's the contract of entirety there is provision for confidential text to be exempted or excluded but things such as the value the broad scope don 't fall within that exemption but sort of specific items around methodologies or commercial rates and so on can be removed so those those those contracts are always up there and publicly accessible next please what must be pursued or evaluated in each in each assessment and you know for those who can 't see from down the back so the for the four criteria that assessed in that our pro being ethical behavior risk management open effective competition and optimizing whole of life cost so it isn 't just the lowest price I in practice I think we need to be more mature in the way we assess some of those particularly the last one optimizing whole of life costs that 's really where we 're considerations social benefits sustainability those sorts of things really need to be considered and where we need to sort of mature in our evaluations but that 's that that 's in each assessment that 's what the delegate must sign off on want to say this outcome is the best value for money considering those four points next please so how does how does the process work well as I said my organization the centralization facilitates sort of center leads procurement we support the procurement process the development of documentation but those valuation is undertaken by the business established generally just from that business area occasionally they 'll be subject matter experts that we brought in to advise on technical matters and they will just sit in isolation reviewing the tender submissions that come in and only in the information that we 've that we 've asked for and the responses that have replied to those questions generally there are a series of questions around sort of technical criteria and they tend to be weighted so they 'll ask things around experience capability capacity personnel those sorts of things they 'll do an assessment they 'll give you a score each of the members they 'll come to consensus score on each of those and that will develop your total weighted technical school so you 'll have a assessment for that and then you 'll have price which will be assessed separately occasionally that will get rolled into the weighted evaluation but only really for items which are very fairly simple sort of items that have a high no surprise component so it 's you know you know we 're talking about something like pencils or something like the nature of the product price is really key so for those for community services it would be separate and then the other thing that we pulled into there is is risk and risk gets assessed and so those items really get pulled together and you know form the basis of the value for money decision there 's been times previously we 're sort of formulas have tried to be applied you get the way to the technical assessment then you get price and you saw roll one over the other we really try and sort of move away from that because they tend to be misleading in one of the reasons we have risk in there is that if someone puts in scores fairly poorly on there on the capability and capacity but then has a very low price if you just have when we can get an outcome that they 're the highest ranked and often perhaps the lowest prices because they don 't understand the work and they haven 't scripted properly in that is it is apparently in the capacity but you sort of fixed yourself got these elements the weighted criterion price and risk and that really needs to be pulled together into a narrative arguing why is this outcome the best value for money thanks please supporting their procurement Act is the government regulation and sort of the important elements of that or is it stipulates the thresholds for procurement and how they they are to be conducted and that sort of breaks this sort of two thresholds it really breaks into into three levels of procurement the first is procurements 425,000 so the only requirement is that one oral quote is sought so for any work under 25,000 the business officer is only required to seek that quote record that and go from there the next thresholds between twenty five thousand and 200,000 their requirement there is to see three written quotes so you 'll generally receive that through an email just might just be an email just asking you whether with our few documentation we 've sort of got a simplified system now so that so that procurements under that level don 't come through my organization they come directly to you which will attach the sort of simplified contract and basic RFQ information the third threshold is above 200,000 and that above that threshold we are required to go to open tender and so that will be advertised publicly what 's also associated or stipulated it will provide for in the regulation is the capacity for an exemption from these thresholds so you would may have heard of of restricted tenders or single select or select tenders so that exemption provides for the director general for any agency to exempt from these thresholds where they swear the broadly is whether the benefit of the exemption outweighs the compliance and I mean and you know sorts of examples of that was when there 's a true urgency to really get a service in where there 's really only one or two providers you know really sort of makes common sense that you know an open tender really isn 't going to be productive or beneficial and but all those exemptions or single selects restricted tenders are reported in the annual report next please you 're able to click on that link this tired the shared services procurement it was only really all sort of the seventh of July we shifted over to procurement and and capital works what you can access through here is that contracts register that I spoke about so all that you can trawl through all the contracts that have been in place can actually do that yeah so there 's release of a search function there that you can you can step through to say to find out whatever contract something they 've been let just go back to the other screen you can but if we go back to the website sorry you can subscribe 4 10 2 notifications so just sign up there and you 'll be emailed out when when tenders have any release towards get a list of what 's coming out so you can always be aware of what 's coming and also there 's also a tab there that which has good and services procurement forecast at this stage that only tells you really that the the near-term future of both procurements that are about to be released so they 're they 're working on and probably give you a sort of one or two perhaps three month advance warning that that something is coming to market so they 're sort of some of the useful items you can find from the website that 's there now next please so we 're where to from here and and some of the improvements the first thing is is a tendering so finally we 'll be doing away with the hard copy tender box you 'll be able to download your tender documentation you 'll be able to upload and respond to tenders electronically save all that hassle printing out and running things over and pop them in tender boxes so that will be in for the next financial year we 'd hopefully there 's a tender process going on the moment for that service hopefully we can get it started earlier than that is as well and that should sort of streamline the process and finally do away with us or the relic boxes that we have the other thing is annual procurement plans which again is a particularly novel quite common across out a 12-month forecast of all the procurements that we will see going forward and so there 's mean general agreement that we will issue that for government and hopefully we 'll have something in place in the next by the end of this calendar year next please further on from that really that their items that we 're looking looking to to really riad ress that issue of of communication about it 's a really a push for us to optimize the speed for that 650 million dollars have spent now if we do it yeah but if we improve by a fraction you know so much money that we can save redirect we can do business better and it 's really looking at utilization of technology changing our approaches so we can have those conversations about what the need is and how we respond so yeah it procurement tools of things that we can do to support that things such as social media enable us to do that sort of broadcast where there 's that concern about when we enter a tender process we can 't say anything that a disadvantage you know the sort of broadcast comes that we can we can utilize to keep that sort of conversation going and and increase the understanding and reduce us at a level of risk better supplier and and marketing engagement and these are some of the things that we were sort of touching on particularly in ICT this it 's really moved to say don 't come to market with you with your solution come to market with the problem allow us to tell you what what the solution is and you know that 's really depend on having sort of those pre-engagement discussions talking about it before before we release a tender trying to get that sort of understanding so we can have a that communication about what options exist so we can best shape and we can understand me but what capability is there out is out there to serve those needs and also measuring and maintaining sort of performance information and one of the frustrating things is is that you respond with two tenders and request for quote so on with same information every single to to you know hold that and reuse it and I think in a simple sentence would not far away from you know through Sovine tendering system to ever hold you know core information about organizations but then stepping on from there it 's issues about performance so so you know if people are doing a good job that in the current work that they were doing that we 're collecting that information we r e utilize that so we 're trying to you know mental minimize streamline the process each time we go to market reduce the cost of it for every one of the burden of responding to these things you know make reducing the process as much as we can so we can spend the money really where it 's where it 's needed so so that that 's really I think this is the task for me is to its really focus on how how we move this reform forward how we improve the communication and we makes a life simpler for everyone and and get the best value for money so that I 've only before you ask questions of Dave I 'll just let you know that we are working with Dave and with others to on the procurement system so recent changes that you will have seen so the translation of a number of service funding agreements to recurrent grants came out of work that day even a working group were involved in other things that are relevant for you as well is that the pre-qualification system that many of you will have signed up for is currently being reviewed and we 're looking at how that can be made streamlined and as effective as possible and there 's a number of other things that are going on to get in to streamline the process so I like to support the comments of Dave made and that we do take procurement very seriously and recognize the considerable impulse that it has on organizations exactly now Christians thought Dave Jenny I 'm just to ask about the length of time that he was around and where that decision around that time comes from if I think about social compact between a minimum of six similar guide for invariably they 'll be tended out five and I guess for me the quality of what then comes to you is compromised and particularly if there are opportunities or requests for agencies to partner or for its audiences quite a lot of complexity involved in preparing so I 'm interested in who makes is the line agency that 's doing the tender process is it from your area and either away okay extending that I know within government you 've taken many many months to get to the point of putting the tenderer and it just yes so that there 's no there 's no maximum time that 's the tenders need to be released there is a minimum time that 's really SAT through free trade agreements and generally above above sort about six hundred thousand dollars it needs to be out for 30 days but the decision really to constrain it or limit the time is with the business area so but there 's there 's no there 's no sort of impediment to for them to make that time you know that if not and I often you know be honest it 's driven you know from a time frame because the service is running out your you know generally were asked to sort of minimize that time because you know we 're trying to get a new service in place and I think you know the real either difficult we often faces conversations just start too late you know with people so busy working away providing a service and it 's 0 of hell you know this contracts going to run out in six months geez we better start the process and it 's not understanding that generally you know it 's a six-month process but you know the real benefit is in in that in that conversation early getting understanding seeing what the options are and that you know really reduces that sort of risk not you know that sort of three or four months okay let 's again sort of define the requirement get it out I 'll give them 30 days we 'll have two week to evaluate it and then we get a contract in place and we 'll shifting we 've got it we 've got to do it better so so there 's no yes that 's it 's really with the business area or in terms of of how long but you know part of the idea with with the procurement forecasts trying to sort of get a better mechanism for discussing things earlier is that we get the whole process moving moving earlier so you know there 's we can have that discussion here this really needs to be out for this type of time so just to build on Dave 's answer the procurement forecast for Community Services Directorate is in the process of being put together now and as of a couple of months ago I acquired responsibility for that so I 'm happy to talk to anyone about it but again in support of what Dave saying it 's certainly my view that the conversations about what we are trying to do should begin well before the time frame to actually put in the submission so I 'll give you an example that right now there 's a new out of home but I 'm sure we 've got providers for out of home care here now the it will be quite some time before those that new strategy goes out for tender but we 've already started working with the organizations that are involved now and with other organizations and other interested stakeholders to talk about what we 're trying to achieve to talk about the outcomes that we want out of the system at a stage where we haven 't reached that probity line that term that Dave was talking about which gives us room to explore exactly what we 're trying to achieve how it might be done what are the indicators out there can they be collected and so on so that we are a better informed purchaser of that service and and the organization to then make a decision as they will or won 't tender for are better informed about what is trying to be achieved in a policy sense and we think doing that will give us a better outcome overall now on our procurement forecasts there 's two or three other major procurements coming for those major procurements how we can get in early and start that conversation we accept of course that there might be smaller ones where you get an email because you 've all written down that you can get an electronic notification of procurements and you might get the procurement that 's 30 days their life still be some of those but certainly for the bigger ones we 're looking at how we can we can stretch that conversation out trying more questions it 's Krishnaveni John butcher from a new office of question for both of you in a sense in some human services markets I think there 's a perception part of community sector organized the preparation of Timbers is something in the dark perhaps they don 't have quite the Christ or they would like to happen in that space of kind of a mini industry has grown up from consultants providing services community sector organisations to assist them to respond to tenders and this of course that means an additional impulse and a level financial risk for those organizations but I wonder whether it also has might suggest about assurance in relation to the claims made by the tenderer being filtered through a consultant who 's trying to second-guess what the right answer yeah I suppose one of the things we 're we 're trying to shift away from is he 's a sort of a formulaic approach that in each instance you know we go through the same process we prepare tenders in the same way we really need to know and i think that sort of breeds that I know how the process works i can i can tell you how to do it we need to sort of shape it in each instance you know as to what 's are the best fits and it takes more work but you 're going to get a much better outcome I think you know the the tenders are really only one part also of the selection process you know there 's also sort of contract negotiation there 's contract management and all those you know and there 's a premature to the consultation all those sort of mechanisms are there to try and and try sort of capable entertainment you know it 's really you know shaping all those processes not just yeah well the tenders the same sort of document we 'll just shift around a few criteria dual waiting so that you know how do we manage that process into wind to get the best of outcome and I think you know by having that sort of conversation the early start and shaping in that in that way you know you 're in the best position to respond to it you don 't really need someone else does become tell you this is how the process works so that that 's really i think the shipper we 're trying to sort of affect just to build on dave 's answer for myself in procurements that I 'm involved in I like to first of all ask questions in the procurement that will get behind the sorts of things that are professional tender writer will write know you and and yes it is important to be good at writing tenders and yes it is easier if they are well written and get to the i 'll put our put questions in procurement processes if necessary i designed to get underneath that the other thing is that a procurement process doesn 't just have to rely on the piece of paper so for example at the introductory remarks it will start one of the earlier community sector development programs was the governance and financial management initiative that 's provided by a panel of consultants in procuring that panel of consultants the thing that we took most account of words what was the the most important thing in that and we decided that it was the individual capacity of the people who would be providing the consultancy service so you can read you know 30 pages this is an excellent organization it does great stuff in it is got offices all around the world fine but what we wanted to see was to have the individuals we 're going to be delivering that service sitting in front of us so that we could question them see what they will like and did we think they had been the ability as individuals to deliver that service so is not to just assume that it 's a bit of paper yes there is a bit of paper but it doesn 't just have to be that you can you can include demonstrations you can include other things that will get you what you 're looking for and as Dave said then there 's a contract negotiation and in my own personal experience not in CST even another organization then you know I 've been in a situation where we 've had to say to a preferred tenderer sorry we 're not going to go ahead because in it turns out that you can 't_''_1941.58 do the things that you said you do so we 'll stop that now thank you very much and we 'll go and try this someone else so there 's it 's I believe anyway the onus is on us as the procurer to get underneath the dough sorts of professional bits of paper other quickness and I I think it 's sort of in the in the example sort of step through as a question sorry yes the question was was just about that tender process isn 't going to provide an example example of that it 's really just bringing in you know I suppose it summer expects its bit of a sort of a common-sense assessment but in an example where where you had a fairly low technical assessment and you 've got a very low price you know a low price in itself it seems you know provides greater value it 's really that that inspection of what 's the basis of of that you know what 's the true sort of capability so it brings it really in that sort of moderation as to you know again to we are what the level of capacity is to really deliver the full service that you 're expecting and it 's a difficult question in a sense because it 's very specific to whatever it is you 're doing but as an example from a different field when i was doing i.t procurement in the past then one of the things we would look at is for example is thinking about risk is is if we want to enter into a path for their technology and does it match where we want to go and if the two are going in different directions then that might be right for us now but it might not be in a couple of years or for example if there are multiple entities in the relationship then what mechanisms are in place to you know back up that relationship is it just a hand shape or is it covered by a contract between those other two agencies you know things like that so I think informal also an example edge thinking is is if a provider is from another geographical location so they 've responded excellently to the two you know their capability got a good price but you 're you know really is you know what 's their capacity to deliver locally you know that 's sort of thing that might get that brought in the international films what 's ability to maintain information those sorts of things okay if there 's no more questions what _"

    "text": "I might call on thy the speakers of this morning dr. Faisal Jason need a mark to the up to the table and we may take about 10 minutes of questions from the floor guys I just want to talk about in a city obviously one of the big things is this land release like it 's actually sometimes it 's much easier to get equity and capitals while we 're here than it is to actually find somewhere to build a property on so if any of you got any ideas about maybe some innovative ways we can convince the government to do better land release or even targeted land releasing will give you this patch but if you spent it on an idea its property for example so I 've been working with a professor thanks Frank I 've been working with Frank now for about six months and this is one of the conversations that we have have started and and it 's actually an ongoing thing so in terms of is there an easy solution to this no there isn 't but I can say that and hopefully over the next six months or so hopefully we might be able to come up with something but it 's not easy and a very good question function just briefly can add to that I think what we 've found to around the country 's yes government have a really important role to play because there 's such a large lien holder but there 's other organizations to particularly some of the larger base Church derived organizations that have really large asset basis and i know some of them are thinking innovatively about how to use their land stock that they have and so having those conversations insurance alignment of values I think can also open up another sort of available land that we could use for some of these projects yes my name is Steve Bevington I 'm mentioned director of a community housing organization that manages 5,500 properties built twelve hundred or so many of them disability based the question I have of the 80 to 120 thousand people this is for dr. bit vzyal who have been identified as needing affordable housing is there data they get well located accommodation and is there data on what level of equity contribution their families or they may be able to introduce thanks for the question um the way that they came up with the figure of 80,000 220,000 was that they looked at the number of potential NDIS participants who are on low incomes so and then they distracted the number of people who they think are already in appropriate accommodation already in social housing or in yes i 'm not sure if they 're dissident not sure about sure supported accommodation whether they 'd attracted that but dad that was a very I guess rough figure that they came up with but by the very nature of the fact that they serve people and low incomes I think they 're assuming that they all need affordable housing and by the fact that it 's under tier 3 I of what they call people with significant ongoing disability i think the assumption is that employment and employment rates are going to be quite low for that group but there is the data is not good I think that group and who they are and whether it is in fact that 80 to 120 thousand people will indeed move into independent living or some of them would actually stay where they are so it 's not known so what the first start to community agencies to T and the aging Sylvester 's disability accommodation those two I think Neil covered that I need to have a surplus and that 's the first thing for any anybody that 's going to lend money to somebody that need to know how it 's going to get paid back and lots of organizations as Neil said they don 't that I work towards a surplus because they want to do what they do with as much money as they possibly can but then they get to the point where they where they want to go in this direction and it becomes a massive hurdle for them to prove that they can service debt a second question there is what is the international experience of using social impact bonds to generate capital to increase visibility housing stock I 'll take that one look impact bonds I 've only been around for about four or so years for the first one was in 2010 and was in the UK it was based on recidivism so reducing reoffending rates for people come in a prison and since then there have been a number of bonds that have gone live in the UK and the states lots of the vast majority are actually on the operating side of service delivery as opposed to the capital side so most of the ones we 've seen have been at kind of 10 15 20 million dollar range and as of course as we know we 're talking bricks and mortar and additional stock we 're talking like much larger leaks of capital most likely if we 're talking about scale so we unfortunately can 't get a lot from the international experience the other thing I 'd mention about bonds is that there is a little bit of a sort of word of caution on them in the sense that they are still in their infancy to some extent and we 've seen much more experience in a single government department and the savings are very quantifiable and very material to government that 's a really critical driver of a sort of a viable bond structure and so within the disability space it 's not out of the question but I may be put to that it 's a little bit more challenging around the I suppose the cost to government cutting across a number of different departments the data piece I 'm not sure and out sort of a different across states and territories but the quality of data around measurement of what the savings are or what the current cost profile is and what the savings will be off the back of a change behavior or increase of stock etc so I 'd suggest there 's a number of different steps that need to be undertaken before you know you could say that the we 're in a bond ready kind of position but certainly SVA others are very keen to kind of have that conversation with you know various players and sector and governments I 'm curious about the kind of returns that super it is a new area so are they looking for a high rate of return on yours and my super after all the returns for super funds of characters to keep being go up thirteen fourteen percent are they looking for a better return I 'm looking for the implication in the cost of getting one of these schemes up um yeah look it 's a really good question i think it 's worth mentioning in the super funds we 've spoken to they 're talking about a very small kind of allocation across their larger funds under management to be allocated to impact investing and i think they recognize that it is very much a fledgling market and so in the first instance they 're open flexible within reason around what those returns might be like so we 've had an indication that something in the kind of eight to ten percent range might be viable on what is across their larger portfolios actually almost a drop in the ocean as we start to talk larger pools and a larger proportion of their allocation i suspect the hurdle will are very keen to be active in the space they recognized there 's a bit of a need free give and take some of the smaller super funds it 's actually their members mandating that they 're more proactively investing in this space so christian soup is a good example who actually invested in the impact bond it was you know comparatively quite a small investment but their members were expecting them to be actively investing into programs projects organizations that are driving a really material social impact more than just the exclusionary of you know gambling and tobacco companies this super fight had a mandate to be proactively listing and therefore with that member mandate it 's easy to be a bit more flexible on the wrist return profile yeah i can just add a little bit to that so superannuation funds they invest their monies across big portfolios so when they 're talking returns if you can offer a super fun day relatively low-risk type of investment you can actually get the the funds cheaper so even though you might be getting up around the 89 or or you can still access funds quite quite cheaply and it all comes down to the entire VIN vestment so in other words if you 've got a really low risk investment and they 've got a I guess you know a risk that they want and in a timeline you can actually get funds and when you think about it you know that the cash rates are record lows some other words they are actually struggling to actually find places where they can actually put money at low rates of low rates of risk if so it is possible i 'm steve fox from National Disability Services my question relates to I think a comment that was made around the the nature of the security one of the issues with people with disabilities is not just affordability but accessibility and I 'm be interested to know views of the financial institutions around the livable housing initiative for example which looks at trying to to get accessible housing and more generally around the issue of accessibility and in domestic housing now look I can talk from a financial perspective and a saleable you 're not really going to have much of an issue so if you 're going to make it highly specialized banks finances they 're going to back away from it if it 's something that appeals to the wider market you 're not going to have any problems I hope that answers a question because we want the long term of the short term started at least has a night market action we would have four hot lady pushing my angel institutions nice little lady and these are two fan this yeah i mean i 'd only added I 'm certainly no expert in the kind of design end of the spectrum but I know there 's a number of organizations and we 've had a bit to a summer foundation not sure if any of you had any involved with them um but there 's lots of work around the kind of convertibility of different builds and so whilst it might be quite modified but if there 's scope for convertibility then the saleability question you get over that hurdle a little bit more so I think builds I think what Neil 's saying particularly in your more traditional kind of financial arrangements is absolutely letter of the law and I suppose that 's where you know the innovative funding arrangements need to be discussed because in some instances the the major banks or traditional finances are not going to be suitable and so how do we look outside they will be for some deals some there won 't be and so then what is the other kind of financial structure we create because there 's money out there outside of those more traditional vehicles it 's around kind of bring the pieces together to make the vital um the other thing I 'd say about this is the reason everybody needs to be involved because if government were to not contribute but to forego things like stamp duty that will increase in the bank or the lenders mind the equity that the the burrowers got in the property because they 're not required to come up with that amount of cash as part of the whole deal so all of those things can go towards making your part to provide more style yeah just one last comment about accessibility that market for accessible housing is not just limited to people with disability also aging society and so it 's a very large market and hopefully the financial institutions understand that okay live is a unique challenge there so thank you very much tonight on the hospital thank the hollow about the detail mark Jason and me for the presentation _"

    "text": "good morning everyone Jason hinders my name I 'm the chairman and Milan glow financial services which is the Bendigo community bank organization here in Canberra and jerrabomberra just want to give you a short history of Bendigo Bank for those that don 't know much about it and then to talk about the Bendigo community banks which is a more recent development and then about our local company here then what about how we might be able to contribute to affordable housing and innovative ideas and then a few examples of things we 've been involved in that are relevant all in the ballpark so the Bendigo Bank is the fifth largest bank in the country was established in 1858 so now it 's a hundred and fifty six years old there 's 450 branches of Bendigo Bank across the country 300 of those a community owned bank franchises so Bendigo is a real Bank it 's not building society it 's got all of the services that the big banks have we have to explain this all the time because it 's called Bendigo Bank and people think proper bank and it does all of those things in the last seven years up to the year 2000 twenty-nine percent of Australia 's bank branches closed for good those are mostly in communities in country towns when the last of the big four left the town with any without any banking services so people had to trail travel to the nearest big town to do their banking in Sudanese small town started to decline Bendigo Bank saw this is an opportunity to make banking viable again in these towns been here bank was already rule based at that stage but but only a hundred and fifty yard branches across the eastern states in the southern southeastern states at that they came up with a new model which was which i think is still unique worldwide it 's a partnership that gives the communities the opportunity to raise the money to open their own can be any bank they 're run locally they 're owned locally and they 're staffed by local people so the first one of these opened in 1988 I 'm not much more than a handshake their banking needs and then use the banking profits to fund all number of valuable community assets groups charities associations this is the aspect that becomes interesting to discussion about the NDIS over the 16 years since community bank Network has evolved we 've become a bit more commercial in our expectations about communities we no longer give money away we invest it it belongs this money in our view belongs to our communities and so precious resource and we expect the groups that we invested with to use it to return what we call a social dividend to the community there 's been over 120 million i think it 's 122 million dollars three million dollars has gone back in the communities across australia the reality is that whilst sausage sizzle every six months or so raises a couple of hundred dollars for charitable organizations to have an income stream and an expectation of ongoing return means that those communities are able to budget for long-term commitments the community banks across the country have 26 billion dollars under management at this stage and the subsequent income production produced from becomes relevant when trying to find new ways of funding expensive items like housing Canberra is no different except that in longer life financial services our organization we now operate for community bank branches and with the largest community bank group in the acct and New South Wales community banks such as ours run by volunteer boards their community minded people from all walks of life I 'm a lawyer we 've got directors who are serving Air Force officers and university students and all descriptions in between the one common thing we have is an objective to get these community banks up to profit and then to return eighty percent of those profits to charities and community groups our first branch opened in 2002 in Coral followed later that year in wantagh sir and more recently jerrabomberra in 11 and curtain in 2012 in the process we 've put back 1.2 million dollars into our local community here through what we think is about 260 local groups and charities right here in Canberra and queanbeyan I 've got a few examples of things that we have supported some of there it 's an independent living and they always emphasize it 's dignified living because it 's not just living for people with mental health challenges that model also is unique I understand in that it endeavours to do what they do providing high quality service and facilities without ongoing government dependence instead they rely on community organizations and corporates to retain their independence to this hand our local community bank has committed fifty thousand dollars over five years to that very worthwhile organization national health co-op is one we supported last year to the tune of a hundred thousand dollars we used profits from the banking business we do we then leveraged with the national health co-op I think it 's our fault they had to change their name from Westbrook on and health co-op because we we agreed with them it was going to be in the token on valley so we provide say this organization banded with us and then we went to government we spoke to them and we leveraged four hundred thousand dollar clinic in Chisholm which provides bulk build GP services a CT government healthcare services to people that open on Valley oz harvest you all might knows change its name to the yellow van these days we provided their second van to that organization which is part of communities at work at a cost of nearly 50 thousand dollars and L 'Arche is a small organization which runs a couple of houses in curtain four mostly adult disabled children of elderly parents it comes home to us about the concern that those older parents who are finding it difficult to deal with when they 've been the primary carer for a long time the angst and worry that they have to deal with trying to work out what 's going to happen when they 're gone so that was a history lesson I hope it wasn 't too tedious for you from now on I 'll try and get a little more interesting the fact is that community bank makes its decisions right here in Canberra it 's not some glass tower in Sydney or Melbourne where shareholding decisions are made we make them right here and we decide where that money is are not day traders they 're in this because they understand what the community bank means to the community they 're more interested in that social dividend I spoke of earlier and that it 's delivered to benefit the whole of the community not just them they 're on the whole pretty happy I understand with the five or seven cents fully Frank we 've been distributing in the past as a dividend I know that stark contrast with the obscenity of the eight billion dollars profit the CBA is reported to be about to be announcing the local community banks has the ability to partner with organizations to leverage territory and federal governments to deliver significant long-term benefits to this community moreover we have the ability to commit to long-term funding at our discretion and as I said those decisions are made right here this is where the Bendigo Bank an affordable housing somewhat of a perfect we 're already in the business of lending money for housing if we increase the amount of money we lend we increase the amount of money we make to put back into we 're all about our community we 're also prepared to commit a large proportion of our earnings as subsidy or capital contribution to the right sorts of projects under the NDIS it 's like a disability care participants will continue to access housing either on their own jointly or in group settings in either the private rental market or via homeownership or through social housing as a locally operated bank Bendigo is sort of uniquely positioned we thing to engage directly with investors with with the disability sector providers and with government to deliver increase stock of each type through either subsidies or reduced interest rates for investors who are prepared to commit to long-term specialist housing stock now or perhaps capital contributions to construction costs or if appropriate modification of existing rental stocks another innovation and I think unique asset that we have available to us through the Bendigo Community Bank network is something called community sector banking community sector banking is a niche financial organization with products and services tailored specifically for the not-for-profit market they 're also the biggest funder I understand if not for profit they 're fifty percent owned by the big bank bendiga Adelaide bank and fifty percent owned by a group of twenty community sector partners so that 's say fifty percent bendiga and 50 cent 20 separate partners some of whom you about already today i noticed the Brotherhood us and Lawrence is there are also include involved with the SVA Anglicare escape Oxfam why foundations eight costs New South Wales Council of social services say organizations that are all in the same sector the same sector is we all work in whilst the local organizations banking relationships remain with the community bank and that 's the retail aspect of this community sector banking they 're able to provide services to not-for-profits that the community bank simply can 't do things like payroll services telecom rental leasing IT hosting equipment leasing fleet leasing all those things that 's very specialized around that not-for-profit they 've invested over 150 million in social and affordable housing equating to about 230 much-needed dwellings there are also the recipients some of you may be aware of power housing Australia they 're the recipient of the it was in recognition of their contribution to affordable housing within Australia first time a strategic partner awards been presented to any organization and the first one at the state outside of power housing Australia 's membership group community sector banking commitment to societal change and connection with the community housing sector and understanding of the issues confronting community housing organizations is the reasons given by PHA for awarding this some recent innovative affordable housing projects by when you sector banking included building a shared equity model for transition to homeownership and also collaborating with PHA to create a rateable housing bond probably something not dissimilar to what Mark was talking about earlier CSP is currently developing an affording affordable housing investment bond product which I think it 's going to be aimed self-managed superfunds international institutional investors if whoever committed to ethical investment policies so that 's the sort of thing that we can do we think or the the area that we can get involved in I 've also got some ideas about what what government might do and I don 't know whether a person gestions or 12 million dollars allocated for the implementation or the catalyzation of the NDIS there 's probably more that government could be doing I know government loves to see corporate dollars going towards community asset creation and people who peas are a flavor of the month if we were to be involved we would use our proposed funding much the same way we did with the health co-op to leverage government to allocate more its own funding to the sector and also to commit to things like reduced fees and charges for investors stamp duties concessions is a big one there reduced land tax perhaps and rates as incentives for investors reductions in planning charges the red tape application fees for the builders who commit to building purpose-built disability housing perhaps reserving land release also possibly with reduced pricing for developers and or investors who are prepared to opt in to long-term disability housing market another thought would be giving all of the rate payers in the territory and the option of choosing to subsidize disability housing and why not have actuated you I 'll do the same in relation to power opt-in option much like the airline 's do with carbon neutral options for fliers and the power companies with the green power options that you get perhaps I was thinking there 'd remarks speech say that perhaps real estate agents might have a place to play here by possibly capping their thieves on transactions around this sort of housing incentives can be reduced or increased to encourage the pipeline stock and I think this is the job of government to be realistic and educated about what 's needed and how long it 's going to take to bring to the market the incentives can be up door down to increase particular types of housing so that the pipeline is delivering when they think it 's going to be needed well as real concerns about the extent to which the federal government 's committed or guarantee the long-term viability of the scheme and indeed any program supporting disability or social welfare and innate the other government 's recent decision to withdraw funding round five of the national rental affordability scheme to me innovation is just thinking differently about solutions to service providers will need to partner with financial institutions and with the construction industry to provide the types of housing products that the newly empowered NDIS consumer wants I 'll just leave you with one final thought I haven 't_''_1003.74 gone too far over mark talked about the one percent of of available funds and and how his organization unions for just that little bit I 've got a similar sort of example but mine 's a little closer to home in the territories 14-15 budget here in the acct the government 's allocated 465 million fair housing and 735 million for infrastructure now by my calculations and what we make that 's a fairly small fraction of the whole budget if we if the government were to invest half of that say into the Bendigo community bank the only likely owned and operated bang in addition to the interest the territory would naturally get received for its investment we would be happy to commit to at least a million dollars to deliver quality affordable housing that 'll be a million dollars every year so delivery of affordable appropriate and all the relevant fields must be in the room when the decisions are made I think most of those people I 'm talking about are in this room now we certainly would like to be part of that and we 're excited by the hard fought and won prospect of empowering people with disabilities thank you _"

    "text": "right Thanks all good morning so I 'll present today a very general overview of the housing landscape for people with disability as it is today and what we might expect it to look during and after the NDIS so there will be those two parts of the presentation so i 'll start with the sort of background just sort of looking at the current landscape and where people with disability leave today so they 're 4.2 million Australians with a disability including about 1.3 million who are with a severe or profound disability which means that it 's a disability that significantly affects their day-to-day lives so where do those people live before I sort of present some of the statistics about their housing 10 years and living arrangements I 'd like to talk about three processes that affected the the landscape as it is today the first one is the institutionalization in the last three or four decades there 's been a gradual process of closing down institutions where people with mostly intellectual disability and also psychiatric disabilities have been living in 1995 there was still about 8,000 about something around 2,000 people so it 's still a substantial number but it 's been a gradual change and that that obviously had affected the what the situation another second process that has been happening has been the increase in the life expectancy of people with disability over the last century or so I think that it 's changing it 's different for every group and type of disability but for example for people with intellectual disability in 1930 the average life expectancy would have been around 20 whereas today it 's around 60 or more than 60 so it 's still well below the population average but it 's a major change and it has significant implications on everything including housing and I 'll talk about that in the in the context of aging carers as well and finally the third process which is related to not just two people with disability but obviously affects them sing definitely is the housing affordability crisis in Australia so since about the mid-1980s the cost of housing as rose well and above inflation and that affects a particularly low-income households and and of overall lower income have been affected by the housing affordability crisis probably more so than any other group in society so we 'll move on to the next slide please so this is just a table taking from the abs data that compares housing 10 years of people with disability and people without a disability in Australia I think the first it 's quite a deceptive table or figure because if you look at the first left column owner without a mortgage you 'd see that people with disability are the rates are twice as high as for people without a disability and that reflects basically the fact that most people with disabilities leave or not most but many people with disability leave with parent carer and many of them live with aging parent carers who are upright owners so before we go celebrate high levels of owner occupation we need to think about the context for that but if we look at the the other columns the public renter column that means that people living in social housing people with disability are significantly over-represented in that housing and private rental in content in in contrast people with disability are underrepresented so it 's very hard for people with this ability to access private renter rental because of the affordability challenge as well as other challenges that I 'll talk about later I 'll move on to the next slide where I 'll talk specifically about people with disability living with with carers and particularly with elderly carers so around Australia we are talking about close to a hundred thousand people with disability we are over 25 we live with a parent care now there are a few issues around that firstly why why do we have that situation happen for most Australians 25 is about the average age where people are expected to move out of the our parents home it 's in I guess in our society in our culture is seen as a major step in the transition from childhood to adulthood and from I guess from dependence into independence for people with disability it 's very hard to make that transition part of that until today has been the very limited access to support options just weren 't there and they 're still not there and hopefully there will be there under the NDIS so that would allow some of those transitions but another barrier has been access to housing so moving out of the parents home you need to access your own housing and that 's again the challenge of affordability which the NDIS won 't in itself solve and that 's where which that 's what we 're going to talk about today how we do we solve that second barrier so one of the issues around that is that it 's there 's a normative issues that are due do we expect people to move out of their home when they 're 25 is that something that we need to expect everyone to learn is that a choice that people make but another question there is about I guess it 's a more pragmatic questions about aging carers the parents not going to be there forever and what we 're seeing today is when the parents died they are just no longer able to care for their son or daughter the under a situation of crisis that 's not good for them as individuals and it 's not good for the system which is becoming increasingly crisis-driven and it 's affecting everyone who already lives in that system of shared supported accommodation and I 'll talk a little bit about that as well all right I 'll move on to the shed supported accommodation system so about 20,000 people with disability live in government funded supported accommodation most of them are people with intellectual disability about 70 to 75 percent i have another graph in the next slide which shows sort of the distributions most of those people would live in group homes group homes are arrangements where you 've got back between four to six people with a disability living in the same house the roster of staff who take a system with their daily living we still have as I said about 2,000 people living in large institutions and other types of congregate facilities and that 's only the government-funded accommodation there are other types of private facilities which are congregated facilities where people with disability leave there are one of it is that there 's not enough of it especially the group homes the the waiting list for group homes are extremely long it 's completely crisis-driven in terms of who gets access into you if you 're not in the crisis if your parents if you if you 're living with your parents you then you 're not in crisis or if you you have to basically be in I guess in risk of homelessness to you to enter some of those places and I guess flowing for that because of the unmet need and because of the crisis driven allocation system people have very limited choice about where they live in chair supported accommodation so they have no choice who they live with and where they live and now the second point there about daily living lack of choice and a living I 'm generalizing here I think some of the group homes are fantastic great staff and really working with their residents in a wonderful way but some of those places are run in a sort of institutional like model where people have very limited eat for breakfast or where they 're going out in evening so that 's part of the shared accommodation system and part of the problem that the NDIS will be trying will try to solve and I 've mentioned just another lights point there i mentioned the history of the institutions it 's not a history it 's still on today there 's still two thousand people living in institutions there 's a long history that 's well-documented of abuse neglect and institutions now I acknowledge that institutions today are not what they were 10 or 20 years ago but there 's a real problem in congregating our large amounts of people with disability in the in a facility like that and there are some real tensions there about the choices that families make about institutions and what the evidence shows about the reality in those institutions and the policy which is explicitly in favor of community living rather than segregated living now there are other people with disability who experience very unstable or an inappropriate forms of housing we have a very large group of people who are young care facilities which is considered inappropriate including approximately 700 under the age of 50 in homelessness people with disability particularly people with psychiatric disability but not only are highly represented among the population of homeless services users or homeless people in 2013 about fifty percent of all users of homelessness services were also recipients recipients of the disability support pension and I think that underestimates their actual proportion so homelessness is a real issue for people with disability particularly psychiatric so as I said more more and more people would be expected to move into independent living and I 'll talk a bit more about what we would like to see under the NDIS I 'll just want to talk specifically about private renter and social housing and to hire housing 10 years where we might expect to see people house so in private rental there are a few issues in terms of access into private rental first affordability which I 've already mentioned it 's very hard to afford private rental when you 're on the disability support pension when that 's your major source of income but beyond just not accessible for people with physical disabilities and because it 's rental because it 's a there 's no security of tenure there then it 's very difficult to modify the stock you can 't get a grant to modify a rental unit that you don 't know if you 're going to stay there more than a year or two and there 's no guarantee that you 'll stay there more than a year or two so there are real barriers to to modifying the existing stock but even when there is stock which is affordable and accessible the evidence shows that in terms of for example affordable stock is actually occupied by higher income tenants and that 's just because the way that real estate markets work they always prefer people who have higher income there I guess safer tenants so that 's a level of disadvantage as well as in some cases just pure discrimination of people with disability in the private rental sector so all those barriers I mean access to private rental is quite difficult and we will probably need to think of ways with the difficulty to access private rental many people with disabilities are very large proportion of them have to move into social housing as sort of the last alternative we have about 160 households in social housing across Australia who have a member with a disability that 's about forty percent of all households in social housing if you look at the portions about six point one percent of all people with disability compared to about 1.5 of all those without a disability again like would like I said about share supported accommodation the first problem is that there is not enough of it is just not enough social housing for people with disability who need it and I get again flowing from that that means that there is no choice that means that when you apply for social housing for public housing and you wait a few years on the waiting list and when you finally offered a placement it 's basically basically a take-it-or-leave-it proposition so there 's no choice about where you live and there are some real consequences for people that might mean that they have from their family and the people who give them support today require in a quite a significant way so that 's in a very I guess just touching on some of the issues around social housing next slide please I want to move on now to talk about the ND and how this is going to change what we 've just so which was sort of an overview of the existing landscape so well I want to highlight three points about how I think or how researchers in the field think that the NDIS is going to impact the demand for housing as well as supply for housing supply or for housing first just to acknowledge the ndas will not cover I mean it does cover in theory all Australians with a disability but those who will receive a guess ongoing long-term supports it 's a smaller group it 's a large group 400,000 people but it doesn 't cover all those I mentioned earlier with severe and profound disability which is about 1.3 million but 400,000 people is very significant group and there will be more funding available for those on that target group now in terms of how the NDIS is structured it 's going to be it 's very different to what we 've seen today so until today we 've seen block funding for sort of shape supported accommodation things like group homes are funded as a service now it 's going to be under the NDIS quite different so individuals will have their own funding now the implications in terms of housing is that the funding is portable an individual can take the funding package with them wherever they live so that allows all sorts of housing transitions people can move if they can find the housing they can move with their supports and I 'll talk about some of the transitions that we might expect to see and finally just before that finally the last point the NDIS does recognize independent living as something that they would like to see and if supports that are required to live independently are considered by the NDIS as reasonable and necessary they will provide it so they will enable people to move out to live independently and supports are reasonable and necessary but I guess that 's sort of the against the principle so I think this is a figure that sort of tries to summarize what I think are the three sort of major pathways we 're going to see sort of facilitated by the NDIS three types of housing transitions first we 'll see individuals who live now we live with their parents adults with a disability living with parents who move into independent living being provided support by the NDIS will also see people who are now live in specialist housing and share supported accommodations or institutions and that there might be two sort of pathways from there some of them will actually move back with their parents because they 'll have more support to live with their families some of them would move again to independent living now independent living doesn 't mean that they live on their own and receive no support it means that they might live on their own or sharing with others but also will receive whatever supports they need to retain that housing but it means that it either private or social hadn 't so those are the three types of transitions and there 's some historical precedents for that if we look at supporting choice in Victoria that was a kind of a victorias a pilot program for individualised funding so quite similar in terms of the structuring of the funding to the NDIS and there were nine hundred and twenty participants who received individualised funding 50 of them indeed moved from shared supported accommodation and you can see in those two figures where they moved to and that 's I think that 's something that we might expect something not very different from this under the NDIS so in terms of living arrangements you see most people moved into shared housing and most of those 50 who moved and a smaller proportion about 23% moved on their own to leave alone and there was a proportion about 19 people who moved from shared accommodation back with their families in terms of the housing 10 years in the housing arrangements private rental was a relatively small proportion of those people about nineteen percent much larger proportion probably other types of housing like aged care and sort of more innovative models like keyring models and maybe some models we might hear today and as I mentioned some move back with the family and in most cases that would be housing that 's owned or in few cases rented and public happening getting closer to summing things up and just before kind of talking about so unmet need for housing under the NDIS what are the housing needs of people with disability if we want to see those transitions happening into independent living particularly what sort of housing would we need affordable housing that 's that 's a given physically accessible housing for people with physical disabilities we 're located housing and by we 're located I mean two things one that it 's well located in proximity to services and transport and amenities but also on a more individual level closer to people 's support networks if people live too far away from their sort of natural informal support network that means there 's a formal supports that they require the pay supports are much higher so a for for the NDIS on support housing needs to be suitable in terms of the mix of dwellings the number of bedrooms for example there 's a high proportion of single-person households and want people with disability so you need to think about how you design the Hat the mix of half of dwellings housing needs to be secure and mean not just a safety or physical safety but also security of tenure so the kind of security or insecurity in private rental is just not going to work for people who require say for example home modifications that 's not going to work for them so we need secure housing and we need housing that 's integrated in the community rather than segregated housing because that 's part of the vision of independent living and the NDIS that 's the underlying principle there do we have all that housing out there probably not the NDIS estimates between unmet need for housing for between eighty thousand two hundred and twenty thousand potential ndas participants now these figures are based on a very sort of rough estimate I think there needs 's I think sort of I guess the bulb Park and so that 's the impact on demand but what 's the impact on supply the NAIAS said initially that they will not take responsibility for housing it 's not their role but they have indicated that there will invest capital funds and quite a substantial amount in catalyzing new housing supplies so almost half a bit more than half a billion dollars a year into into housing into new supply of housing now we 're all awaiting the NDIS discussion paper or housing discussion paper that has been promised for a while and hopefully that would clarify how that funding is going to be structure and how that might work and that would clarify a lot of issues but I guess some of the hints that have been thrown here and there or that it might be structured a bit like cameras or with some lessons from man was and what is the national rental affordability scheme that has been facilitating a new supply of affordable housing in recent years the ndia itself the ndas Authority will not own to build housing so we will partner with other I guess stakeholders to do that to get funds for every dollar that the NDIS intends to spend in capital they expect to see leverage of an hour about two to three dollars from other sources and those sources are probably going to be the community sectors and families of people with disability will just provide money private finance as well as state and local governments and I think the the aim there is to try to to get land from from governments so that would significantly reduce the cost of building new housing so so that 's sort of I guess some of the principles there but again we 're waiting to see what 's what 's the word coming out of the ndia very soon hopefully so next slide please it 's just before I finish a few of the tensions that I think we should I think they might come up in the discussion today I 'll just sort of touch upon those issues the expectation for leverage there are some questions about equity there so if you who don 't have that money there 's going to be a real tension around and the is is all about controlling choice for participants but when they go out there and seek for housing assistance where it 's as I said it 's a sort of take it or leave it proposition there 's going to be a real tension there how do you really achieve choice and control in that sort of context and I guess the third very contentious issue is uh just again I mentioned the need for integrated housing in the community and there 's some real debate in the community around what is integrated housing and whether cluster type housing and congregate facilities are legitimate options are integrated housing in the community some parents groups of say that this is not a segregated community but an intentional community and but some of the research evidence is very much against those types of facilities so there 's a real debate and there 's it 's going to be difficult I guess too they 'll do is there is a need for a real its policy that we 'd like to see in what is legitimate types of housing that government would invest money into so just my last slide final notes a full scheme the NDIS will cause histórico ly unprecedented boosting demand for housing that is affordable accessible and well located but also a catalyst for new supply of such housing so its provision with revolutionizing the disability sector and I guess it 's now up to the housing sector to to rise up to the challenge and hopefully today we 'll have some good insight on how we can do this that 's it _"

    "text": "um look I 'm the last speaker on the panel the surf noon so Frank I 'll try and make up some time which I promise to do Ron you given that you said our builders might be at work so much with some of those potential negatives you raised and said it 's been an interesting time for our industry to and whether we know it or not you know this year we 've seen 140 or thereabouts-- builders that are no longer in business so it 's a stressful time for everybody right at this moment and thanks very much for having me here today Frank as the representing the building industry firstly I do have to acknowledge for those who have got their notes I 've taken a demotion here this morning Frank I 'm not out of the national office on the executive director of MBA a CT which is more important for me there at the other end of the scale there they do as we tell them so look at the delivery end from the building construction industry obviously we 've got a important role to play and we 're having a number of discussions about how we actually provide builders that are able to meet the needs of people in this expanding market I was drawn as I did a little bit of research for today to a quote that I saw which was a person 's home is a sanctuary a place for rest for socializing with friends and sharing life with significant others it is an important platform for life in the community and that was in a housing support for young people with disabilities transitioning to independent living and study by the Youth Council of Victoria and I think as I said we are it 's something we can all relate to we hear so much out there about housing stress we hear so much out there about housing affordability we know what we possibly know that the Senate Standing Committee on economics their inquiry on housing affordability has now been extended from jun 14 issue to report by November it 's the magnitude of the task the magnitude of the complexity housing supply the housing supply Council notes that their their needs we 're seeing significant changes around ownership and rental again contained with the latest or the last nhcs report mba national forecasts notes around 200,000 housing starts by around two hundred and two thousand and 17 but we 've got a current undersupply notwithstanding the comments of Ron of potentially around 300,000 dwellings how much of that needs to be do we need to consider in terms of dealing and with people with special needs and and with NDIS because I think as the industry we haven 't_''_177.73 we haven 't necessarily come to grips with that yet what are the potential obligations of our industry and how do we work with the disability sector and others to actually deliver on that need because it 's no question it 's a more complex environment out there today than it ever was we 've moved a long way from the innocence of the 50s and 60s and 70s and so said I think whether it 's beholdin on all of us to to understand so what role we might have to play I think the housing sector the in this new challenge I note some commentary that the housing sector has traditionally designed and built to form rather than to meet need I think largely that 's changing and quite considerably it may have been somewhat true in the past but I think we understand now there is a greater ability and I think there is an ability and an imperative de Duras to respond to a diverse community one that we 've got greater recognition of in in this 21st century I 'm pleased to say you know from our own end we 've got builders who are working quite specifically in that area and in 2009 I think it was Master Builders national award winner came from the acct who specialized in delivering housing for those with special needs and I think that you know well it was a great feather in the cap of that young builder I was at a forum yesterday on Capital Metro light rail and what does that mean for everybody and it 's about new range of choice and options I think that there 's there 's no question that in mind this diverse economy there 's a diverse community that we 're dealing with there 's been all sorts of speculation about what might happen around capital metro and and it 's not just about putting people in in multi-unit and the high-density living people want detached housing they need detached housing as well we 've had a lot of discussion about potential adaptive reuse of buildings there 's a lot going on in that space at the moment in terms of office accommodation older office accommodation what 's the ability to convert some of that place in very good locations that might deal with some of the requirements of those with special need it 's adjacent to town centres we 've we 've seen schools as well where there 's a lot of discussion about both aged care and schools there are a lot of conversations going on I 've met with the chief executive of livable housing and that 's for people for the older people in the community to deal with their transition but obviously again in discussions with the acct government a lot of consideration with our industry and again as I said we do acknowledge our role to play in this in this space I just remind people though I don 't know whether you 'd know but last year we build a thing called charity house and that was working with the acct government and that that house was was specifically built with universal design in mind and and must say we were very pleased because we raised 582 thousand dollars for the for some people in the homelessness area and housing area of need um as I said it 's a complex situation the complex subject matter and it 's something that we 're all coming to grip with grips with sometimes I get concerned when I hear that government isn 't going to do it or can 't_''_404.72 do it then that begs the question what are the initiative is what are the incentives that that can be provided for others and it will take some incentive to participate in some of those solutions as we go ahead over time I said from our industry 's perspective we 've got a around training and the need to train but we need to understand that in the context of the need of the committee we can 't just go out there and say well we 'll train people and then we deliver something that 's just not needed so as I said there 's a lot of conversations going on affordable housing housing action plan of the acct government the phase three of that report noted 14 action items it discusses the twenty percent of new development around or development around affordable housing and other initiatives and EDD I think that 's point number fourteen spoke about up earning global release of up to sixty percent run of of property for for affordable housing and another need so we 'll wait and see what happens there look Frank in the interest of time I 'm happy to finish off there except to say that we have been in discussion with CSD training fund authority to see what role we can actively play in this space because we think it 's really important and and so that our industry is prepared and they all sorts of things available there but it 's got a bit at a cost effective way that that will deal with solutions for everybody say thank you _"

    "text": "yeah good morning it 's great to be here I wanted to spend just the first 30 seconds of my presentation considering innovation because that 's what we had to talk about as an innovation in relation to housing and so it 's defined as something new or different introduced the act of innovating and when I told a colleague of mine that I was coming to speak this morning she said I who who 's attending us at our housing providers service providers representative government maybe some real estate agents etc and she said well that 's an audience that can kind of create magic thought what a great challenge that is for us to try and create some magic today and thinking about the wide breadth of skills and experience within the room today you know that 's what we want to try and find and tap into and think and that 's really what innovation demands so I 'm certainly not a magician it kind of requires everyone to come together but I hope over the next two minutes or so it can help facilitate some of might be possible around thinking about increasing supply in an innovative way so I just want to give you a really quick snapshot of who s phase for those who don 't know tell you a little bit about the work that we 've done in the impact investing space and how it 's mobilizing capital to be deployed into a number of different kind of really challenging intractable challenges that we face from a social perspective and then I suppose put a few challenges out to the audience so SVA we 're 12 years young we 're not for profit ourselves and we 've got about 50 staff scatter around the country so we 've done a fair bit of work in acct as well over the last four or five years helping lead the the acct social enterprise hub and yes i 've got international footprint so really um i suppose the way SVA does its work is those three blue circles are kind of really critical we try to connect capital from everything from government super funds high net worth individuals and deployed into the social sector both in turn within SVA but actually work with talent within the sector to build their capacity and all the work that we do really needs to be underpinned by an evidence base so if evidence base is not there then we work to actually build up that evidence base ensure that we 're we 're allocating capital and resource is into programs projects etc they 're going to achieve the outcomes that we 're seeking to achieve impact investing is one part of the work that social ventures does and it 's the part that I 'm a director in and this is kind of a nice clean slide to give you a flavor of what the impacting that investing market looks like it 's it 's relatively in its infancy within Australia there 's been a bit more development over in the UK in the US but it 's really been born out of both the demand the supply side that is on the demand side we 've got four purpose organizations that are looking for my diverse funding base historically not-for-profits_-RRB-_181.92 would largely seek their funding from 's looking for diversified areas that source of capital to actually be deployed and to achieve some of these social or address from the social challenges they 're facing on what is across the country fiscal challenges and then on the supply side and this might be a surprise to some there 's actually a large number investors that are seeking to put their capital into action in the social space needs to fit their their particular parameters and criteria in which they want to invest but there 's a large amount of capital that wants to be deployed into the sector and so it 's very much where the impact investing market sits and that 's really the role of SPI and I was like SVA who are seeking to us Bose bring together those two ends of the spectrum as I mentioned you as you look across that kind of spectrum you know historically there 's the philanthropic funding grant funding in which providers will receive capital and yes I 'll need to deliver certain outcomes but the money 's out the door and and there 's sort the other side of spectrum is the kind of commercial for-profit world in which investment is made and there 's an expectation of return depending on whatever that vehicle might be and again sitting in the middle is the impact investing space and so from an SEO perspective we see that is playing a more flexible roya trying to bridge the gap between that of sort of grant feel anthropic funding on one end of the spectrum and the other end being kind of a pure for profit maximizing profit into the spectrum and so it is a little bit disruptive as that quote suggests it 's moving away from sort of two very traditional kind of structures and trying to create I suppose a bit of a middle ground just thinking about specifically what that looks like from a sort of a financial product perspective again there 's very much in as many of you 'll be familiar with the sort of donation and government grant world or government contracting work on the other end of the spectrum is you know you 're kind of your bad end of it kind of make as much money as possible quite speculative etc um but as you can appreciate there 's a lot of activity and potential in between and so the social dead idea is that NS VI has a small fund in which they 're deploying capital in this space is actually to be more flexible in their terms then what a traditional financier like a mainstream bank might be and that can be anything from the terms of the line that the underlying security that 's required etc much more flexible and really a desire to get alongside our partners organizations that we invest into to actually support them ensure that the the capital we deploy is used for the purposes that 's been agreed but also to ensure that the social outcomes are being achieved then there 's a kind of commercial debt which is sort of you know for any of us that have a mortgage understand what that world looks like and then this new kind of term social impact bonds that some of you might be familiar with or some may not be it of its risk profile sits in between kind of commercial debt and equity and really the way it works is at a very simple level it 's a tripartite agreement between government between a service provider and between private investors and essentially what it seeks to do is it identifies a challenging social problem that that that has a significant fiscal or financial burden on governments and that can be easily quantified I 've measured and if a program is delivered that can make a material impact on those savings then government the savings from from the deliverer of that service is that it goes back to repay investors so basically investors stump up the capital upfront to go into the service provider the service provider delivers that that service and over a period of time through kind of rigorous measurement as the outcomes are being achieved government saves money and put a portion of those savings and then channel back into the investor so the investor receives a return the government gets both a social outcome and also savings from budgetary perspective and the service providers happy because they their service in terms of thinking about how much capital is available it 's kind of how long is a piece of string but what we do know is that there 's close to two billion dollars of capital invested through our super funds largely and as I see I likes to talk about if even one percent of those funds was deployed an impact investing space we 'd see 20 billion dollars inject into the space now I certainly appreciate that that 's a huge figure and the requirements on tapping and some other capital is is difficult and onerous but even on conversations that our the impact investing time in s-phase had at a last number of months with both super funds high net worth individuals we see hundreds of millions of dollars in which organizations fund managers are keen to deploy into the social space within the right kind of perimeter and an instead of structure that 's being created so a huge amount of opportunity the markets large there 's a lot of capital it 's around being collaborative collaborative and innovative across all of us set up products and vehicles that are appropriate to tap that money so who are the investors that I 've mentioned SVA has sort of engagement across all of these high net worth individuals so that 's everything from self-managed super fund to family trusts and private ancillary funds so investors who are socially minded and who have lots of capital at their disposal large philanthropic foundations and trusts corporate foundations largest super funds and institutions at varying degrees but lots of these players are very keen to step into the impact investing space lots of them actually don 't know how to and I suppose that 's where SVA and others who play in the intermediary space are trying to I suppose hold their hands and find product and opportunities in which to invest that capital I just wanted to share this this was a survey that we did after one of our the social impact bonds that closed up in New South Wales is regarding restoring young children who are in out-of-home care back to the original families I just thought was an interesting insight into the mindset who invested in that bond we 've raised about just over seven million dollars and was heavily oversubscribed which in layman 's terms says that there was more demand more people wanting to put their capital into the bond then what we could take on which is positive sign but the two highest kind of measures for what drove the investment decision by our investor base was both the social impact so the potential impact on the lives of vulnerable children and also the financial return so just really I suppose emphasizes the importance of of measuring those two kind of considerations that investors absolutely concerned about the social impact but the equally that the financial return is really critical so we need to ensure we 're hitting the particular benchmarks required so what of what do we know about collaboration and what have we done in this space that move with a fund that that 's a combination of both Commonwealth grant funding and private investor capital so we 've raised five million dollars of private investor money and we 're investing that into enterprises and community housing fighters along with a financial return on that investment we were also very heavily involved along with Ben sock mission and brotherhood of science to bring together a consortium to do what to date has been a largest impact investing deal in Australia where he raised 165 million dollars to actually buy what used to be the obviously learning centers and he 's now good start and an over 165 million about 40 million of that was what we call social notes which was really social impact investors that were wanting to put their capital into this investment to see kind of material outcomes for young children who are in child care and and so I suppose that gives us up and hope about where the next kind of large transaction is going to come from in the impact investing space and as I mentioned social benefit bonds which the first was a collaboration between svn unitingcare burnside been swap around the other social bond and across a number of the states around Australia and territories is a lot of interest around social impact bonds recognizing there only for a really opportunity there and investors are certainly kind of attracted to that model I suppose the question is well what next what else says there 's a lot of activity in the sort of direct fund investment space social impact bonds but what else can we put our heads together and find vehicles structures in which investors are really uncomfortable to to our to deploy their capital so what are the and look there 's nothing new here but the kind of obvious ingredients to these investment opportunities particularly in the thinking about sort of housing space for those with disabilities land and stock is vital and because of the Affordable challenges that alarm spoke about how do we actually find land and or stock on potentially concessional rates and what is the role for government to play there for community housing providers to play for for real estate agents around sourcing that land and stuff that 's appropriate we absolutely need private capital government are clear across the country that they 're not going to stump up the full amount of capital required so that 's where we need to into a lot of that private capital its keen to be deployed we we need innovative partners we need and that 's not just an SVA that 's SVA working with a large number of different players to actually bring this to life and that 's kind of almost each of you in the room and have a really important role to play in that and of course government absolutely there 's challenges around I suppose market failure in this space and because of some of the affordability challenges that of course impacts on the sort of economics or viability of a particular project from a purely market perspective so what 's the government 's role to kind of plug that gap and provide I suppose the support and the framework needed to again ensure that private investments unlocked just really briefly in closing I just wanted to talk through two examples at SVA has been involved in recently in the housing space there 's a youth FOIA model and these aren 't the youthful mod is not specific to people with disabilities but what it does I suppose hard we 're looking at a development in New South Wales that 's going to it 's for young people at risk of homelessness it 's giving a 60 studio apartment build but it 's getting a mix of young people at risk of homelessness with mainstream student accommodation and so what that actually does by mixing the tenure other tenancy mix sorry is that it actually starts to improve the economics and encourages more private capital into the into the into the development and so what we 're looking at is a seven million dollar upfront capital that 's required and close to seventy percent of that can be sourced from impact investing dollars so all those investors I talked about before we can use their capital to come in because it just over two million dollar gap there that needs to be plugged either through the support of government philanthropist corporate etc and and within this particular deal the land is provided by the service provider which again is largely a free kick and the nature of some of these challenges it needs to be a cobbled together package do a full development because of the economics don 't stack up and therefore you can 't tap into that meet impact investing dollars um in Queensland there 's an elderly parent care as initiative that some of you might be familiar with with an objective to provide sustainable living arrangements for adults with disabilities who are cared for by their elderly parents and again basically the deal was that it was a commercial developments being done and the developer was comfortable with giving up one floor or I think it was a sixth floor development and those eight dwellings were going to be disability friendly and through a government grant of 1.6 million dollars it was going to be leveraged double that to ensure that these the accommodation could be affordable and saleable for people disabilities so I suppose the question of then I 've got a lil bit over time so apologies is really well what next how do we actually kind of get our heads together and collaborate on some ways really big challenges and as I 'll are mentioned they are challenging when affordability issues a there 's really important kind of design considerations which often he actually increases the cost of capital builds how do we kind of solve for this and it really is a case of everyone coming together and are thinking about community housing providers who are willing to leverage and potentially have land or stock that they can contribute and progressive boards and management 's that are able to see through I suppose some of the immediate challenges and think at a bigger picture service providers around input on design and and in location considerations absolutely a requirement for government to be a willing participant and I think forms like this or a good reflection of that but government to be thinking about what role do we play to plug I suppose that gap between sub market and market returns um real estate agents thinking through access to land and helping around some of those kind of the stigma challenges and even developers think about low cost construction models so there 's no easy solutions but I suppose that 's the kind of beauty of collaborating together and that 's where room I recently saw lion king the musical I 've been Sydney bit of a sucker for the old Disney Disney production and you will know from this scene Simba gets told everything the light touches is ours and not to get too philosophical but we 're kind of on the cusp particular in acct within the ice rolling out and this incredible opportunity and we look out upon the horizon and there 's a whole amount of opportunity and with all the heads in the room and the skills and experience I think it 's a great time to begin that journey get our heads together and start to work through how we can be no value even collaborate together to get really terrific outcomes thank you _"

    "text": "hi there Marshall karen 's from cell phones housing in New South Wales we have a situation where if a private landlord leases a property for under 75 percent of the market sorry so as at seventy-five percent of the market rent they can be and within a geographic area of distance from the GPO they can be get a land tax waiver and your comment that land tax is going to go up wells gonna okay could this be more of an incentive to private landlords to offset lower rentals absolutely but I think we 're down to talk to Andrew Barr he 's very keen on he says preserving a dollar I think that 's prankster makes Lee this house preserves every dollar it can get and I land rent has gone through the roof and we really need to be in line with the other states but you raise something very interesting which which I in turn will race within but that 's a good point thank you I decide to that that we 're actually in discussions with the ATO at the moment for looking at could then claim that twenty-five percent as a tax deduction against so it 's a charitable donation we 're putting together a paper at the moment they want to see what we 're doing how we 're doing it why are we doing it and how we 'd measure things like what affordable rent is like the twenty five percent and how we 'd then benchmark market rent so to be able to prove that difference is actually a donation so there 's some work being done around that and if it does happen that 's going to be amazing for our landlords to be able to then tick some more boxes with just allowing us to rent their property and get some value add back to them sean kelly from housing can I just ask a question really about the two industry representatives on the panel about what role they see their industries I 'm playing in terms of matching people with disabilities to the property and I think it 's a very complex process for people with you know high levels of support requirements and particular property requirements we 're relying on people with disabilities to negotiate or an already complex market around support how do we kind of I guess ease some of those barriers for people in trying to be matched to the right property I thank you I I really think it 's an education thing and I my last point was that the the landlords the investors the agents and the property managers need to be across it in a more positive way than what they are today I also said I thought that some of them didn 't know how to handle a lot of those situations we need to make sure that that we provide the education based so that they are aware and and that it 's it 's going to be a very good thing for them it 's going to be more of it and it 'll be good so it 's all about education think short for the question it 's interesting I think that 's a point I was really trying to make that we can 't sit there in isolation and and just deliver a form recognize today that we 've got a more you know diverse community with a whole range of needs you know there will be some things that will be standard and then there will be other things that need to be actually quite specific to individuals I think we 've seen the industry change you know we 're not out there and there 's not the speculative housing being built that there once was it 's more in the contract situation and so you know that 's because the demands i guess of communities have become far greater these days and so it 's just not good enough to deliver as i said of one size fits all add to that we 've found particularly at home brand when we work in the private rental space and unlocking it for our clients that are homeless and need to really look at recruiting people that can work across both sectors that it 's not necessarily the job of a social worker to go out and source private rental because that 's not where their fear comes they don 't feel comfortable in coming from a different world so we 've found by recruiting people that have come from real estate into the social services and are able to go across both we 're getting better at sex for our clients so they 're talking the talk walking the walk but then coming back into a relaxed environment and able to work with clients as well so yeah I found that a really good help hi my name is Jose Robertson I 'm one of those people that was forced out of acct housing because of having a to great income now the circumstance that that were my 40-year old paraplegic wife decided that she would like to have a child and join basically mainstream society in that wish so we were had to go to private rental property which is damaging her every day I 'm just this is just my personal background but the question that I 'm asking which is of a broader nature is then why Cannot the acct NDIS task force amend its guidelines so that in order to help the builders sort of being thrown out of new build house you can do it with the assistance of the NDIS right now at the moment we have to wait until 2016 to even enter into a conversation with the ndas about building an accessible home unfortunately the head of the task force isn 't here but could I take that question I 'll notice and could you reply but absolute apologies but I 'm representative isn 't here so i think it 's not colleges but i will picked up on those i 'm with good year of life i shall do last question oh look i mean one thing i 'd really like to say that it always comes up to the day city is quite a weed jurisdiction because of the way that our private rental market works we don 't have an affordable private market rental it just doesn 't exist I think that 's one of the big issues that happens and I 'd sort of challenge that thing you 're saying run about public housing the number of sort of people paying full market rent around those income levels is really insignificant way you really get in public house in these days is through the MDP if you 've got really complex needs it 's not accessible the big gap we have there is between social housing then at 25 cent rental and then you just jump straight to sort of your three bedroom house at 450 or two bedroom apartment around for 20 what 's actually really missing is that middle ground and actually thinking the a.c.t that 's the thing in terms of affordability that would actually free up a lot of those places because we actually have a lot of people there that will sort of this a disincentive for them to actually get employment get more stable and actually try and get into the private rental market because there 's too great a risk between that level of social housing and those high levels of private market rentals and and I don 't see a lot of buildings or builders that are out there that are trying to target that section of let 's go out and build a house that might actually get rented out for only point quest no you won 't_''_456.599 as John has said there 's no speculation out there in terms of housing now it 's all contract and built perform but on the on the first point CHC affordable housing target something like twenty five percent below market rent for those that qualify so there is somebody out there trying to do that but there 's no other formal company or agency which is trying to hop into the private market I think a CT how you 've gone a long way and that 's what 's drawing me a lot about putting the kiosk in is that those people who don 't qualify for a CT housing can be assisted through having bonds paid for them they 've got to pay it back but bonds paid for them should they find an appropriate property that they can find in the private market and that will be a huge incentive if you like and and benefit to those people seeking to get into the private market and and I think you 'll find rents in the last the last 12 months come that and that 's because we 've got four thousand properties on the market for rent right now and that 's going to increase and I think it 'll increase even further because of the burden of land tax so there will be plenty of opportunities out there but in terms of a central agency concentrating on just that one area apart from government no there isn 't at this stage just want to add to that it 's about asking the question it 's about having an agency or multiple agencies willing to ask that question of their landlords can you will you give us property at affordable rental there 's so many people out there that are in a position that they can they might have a portfolio of two or three or just the one property they 've owned it for 25 years there in that that age bracket where they 're starting to question what they 've given what they 've done for society if we don 't ask the question we 're never going to get it if we want affordable housing we want to need someone to stand up and start asking for it and to give someone the quality service back so we can 't ask for something and then not provide excellent professional property management but if we can put it together in a package it works and people are willing to do that I think we 've heard a fairly wide spectrum today of opinions in the face and principles and I think I picked up from Ilan quite clearly some principles as we move in this this piece of work around affordability decibel world appeared suitable secure and then to create it so I think there was some grip and principal statements there plus fairly significant overview of what the situation is in most fiercest is mark talked about private capital for social good and alerted this to the fact that there is a large amount of that capital available and highly actually broker that 'll be challenges Jason really talked about a very unique model of banking that is available locally and also that there 's long-term funding at local discretion which give a high degree of ownership in issues and challenges I felt the government in this presentation as well about being more than the fear than their thoughts Nadel talked about application and trying to actually bring a lens of realism to it about how you would actually go about getting the finance but also building the capability of your organization to achieve that I heard clearly from Belinda and you 've said it again but it 's really resonated to me and do you say to people do you have something you can give and we often think about products and chargeable products that are in the marketplace this is a very practical application that could be done then your case examples was a really inspirational to hear the very fact too that you 've been able to achieve a 75 of these rental products since March is unique achievement wrong and Ron I don 't know why buy your coffee wrong but anyway that 's another conversation but your challenges has ever been fantastic your insight into this area has been grid and your leadership to roam the real estate institute I very much appreciate out a range of challenges to the work government needs to think plus you you again how the synopsis no it was lovely to hear your synopsis of the sexion principles that alone presented from a real estate agency and John 's presentation very much talked about I think was really good to hear that industry has to start building to need rather than form and I think that 's a great group message for us to hear today that that 's where the Master Builders Association is looking on behalf of us all I 'd like to thank Ilan mark jason nail bilenda Ron and John for their presentation and additionally thank Polly who 's been quietly laborious ly writing a script today which I 've noticed with grid and interest the people have actually been relying heavily on it not just for me but they were not hardly odd and to actually get the context of the conversation so again thanks very much for attending today again thank you to all our presenters thank you _"

    "text": "my name is our Neil skipper I 've been at havelock Housing Association for six months and you 're probably wondering why I 'm talking up here now and enter is prior to that six months actually spent 28 years in the as well as mark was referring to the bad into town so so for the last 12 years I was actually the the state manager for any bank here and and I spent either my time doing as a state credit manager as a sales manager so in the credit roll we actually assess many deals so today what I want to talk about is putting a deal together and in particular preparing your organization to obtain finance obviously when you put a deal together there 's many different aspects but so I 'm going to look at the finance aspect and more specifically in terms of a community housing provider okay so the five things that financial or typically look for and it 's just not a financial to invest or as well one is a capacity to pay so they want to make sure that they what the security is the capital ok so we 've spoken a lot about capital the character so the skills track record of the staff the board and the organization can actually do what they setting out to do and conditions is there anything else that could be affecting the security with capacity if you 're going to go out to market the first thing that they 're going to ask is that you 've actually got the ability to to repay the debt so if you 're going to repay a debt they 're going to be looking at whether or not your organization has a surplus okay so in the past community service organizations have typically worked on the premise that they should not have surpluses and that all resources should be allocated to delivering services and accommodation it 's a pretty good argument I mean how come you 've got this surplus money you should be out there providing it but there 's also another argument and I think we need to look at that site as well so this would be fine if if government had organizations unfortunately this is not the case and with changing demographics and the endless demands on a government budget this is unlikely to change anytime soon so we need a reality check they 're not going to keep funding us okay I finance and this is where we need to look at ourselves in terms of community housing provider so a financial will look at the last two to three years financial statements to determine an organization 's ability to service a credit so if we 've been working on the premise that we don 't need to have a surplus and that we 're meant to be providing all that money to provide services we 're not going to have much of a chance of going out to the market and attracting funding in to do developments okay so you will find it difficult if you haven 't moved past that okay community next slide please yep community service organizations need to become business savvy and prepare their financial position statement so they can retain finance when they require okay we need to move to that type of basis to achieve surpluses as our clients customers are not in a position to where they can pay full market rents for services I income-based affordable rent so in other words we can 't get the same return as what we might be able to but we 'd have other advantages as well community service organizations will need to improve operational efficiencies collaborate and even consider joining together to drive down costs and create surpluses that will be required to grow the services that the community requires so I was that 's just I 'm back into what Mark was saying we need to get together if we 're going to deliver these things okay the second thing is the security or the collateral so the more saleable a security the more a financial the financial end against it okay if we develop specialized secure specialized properties for social disability housing we may be limiting the amount we can borrow and hence increase the amount of capital required we need to be smart about the design so it does appeal to the wider market you don 't want to get into if something goes wrong we won 't be able to sell and we won 't be able to get our money back our investors aren 't going to be happy and and as a lending proposition they 'll be looking to reduce the amount of money that you can actually you know use those securities for okay so collateral given the income-based affordable rents loan-to-value ratios must be lower to have a sustainable proposition there or greater capital will be required okay unless community sector organizations have capital retained earnings they 'll need to consider other ways of obtaining funds such as grants or collaborating with other organizations and all the government so again it 's just time back into what Mark was saying okay the third thing that a financial look for is capital so a financier will always look for ways to mitigate risk and maximize the chance of recovering funds to an organization get into trouble so the first thing that they look for is obviously the capacity which I mentioned then the security the sale ability of it and finally the amount of organizations equity or obtain finance and organizations that don 't_''_315.12 so again just coming back to the wearer my previous comment if we have community housing providers or organizations that are not creating surpluses and who don 't have capital they 're going to find it difficult in order to attract finances and get that money in to do these types of developments righty-o just on to the next one the other thing that finances will look for the fourth thing is is the character of the organization finances will assess an organization and its staff capabilities can they actually do what they are setting out to do do they have the required skill so in other words it 's unlikely that have lock housing association will be successful in obtaining finance to build rocket ships okay obviously but it is likely that we will be able to obtain finance for community housing so you need to really stick to your bread and butter there okay the final thing the fifth thing that financials will look for is is other market conditions so is it risky to be building houses when there are to enter market because the returns are safe and good finances minority nothing as finances might already have too much exposure to a particular market segment or organization so one example here was one of the big developments in Canberra we are when I was working for any bank we were unable to help people because we had already had already reached the maximum amount that we could actually fund within an organization so there 's all those type of quirky things that financial look at so in summary community sector organizations need to demonstrate that they have the capacity to service a debt and capital if we don 't have those two components it 's unlikely that we 're going to be able to track the financing that we actually need okay this is something that I just want to throw in here a definition of a sustainable social housing project lots of people talk about what is that they want a sustainable project and I 'm actually going to throw up a definition and that is rental income received from the project services the debt maintenance and the 's not actually drawing down on the organization 's reserves you can actually sit over to the side and then it frees up the organization to keep doing these types of development given that income based or affordable rents are received more capital is required for uh so for a social housing project to be sustainable we need you know coming back to what everybody 's been talking about we need that capital so that we can actually get these projects up and running and then we can then go out we can actually get the social bonds that mark was referring to and then with a combination of enough capital the social bonds and then somebody such as Havelock housing association or another community housing provider can then actually go out to the market assuming that we 've got the surpluses and we 've got the capital behind us we can actually go in get the social housing problems the social housing bonds and we can actually have it with a sustainable process where the rents from the from the projects actually service the bonds and then the management providers or other like organizations but those community housing providers need to become very very lean and they need to become very operationally efficient so so that we can actually move towards that type of arm that type of program so just to finish up their community sector organizations will need to collaborate with other community organ asians and all the government to go and provide the services that the community news and i think the the final point that I think we 're all are in agreeance with here and it 's coming across is the demand for Community Services is growing and is greater than we can satisfy they go thank you sorry about the rush _"

    "text": "i think this whole point of introducing light rail is to explore scales of connectedness when you 're taking your metro you 're walking to and from so you 're interacting more with the environment around you with other people active transport is about options for transport that aren 't just sitting in the car and turn the radio on that 's the difference between good design and something that 's just just okay like is the integration of all things that contribute to a place being a good place and transport 's part of it one of the benefits i think is it sort of brings people together as is often mentioned you meet people i do that when i 'm in european cities at stations when you 're on the train and so on if we are to look at enabling effective active transport and we utilize public transport as an active transport means it really means that we 've got to have integration it means that you can easily and readily ride your bike to a stop and go thanks very much feel comfortable about having a do your bit in town come back hop on the hop on your bike to go back home i 've seen some statistics if you look at european cities that have good urban transit systems rail bus ferry wherever it is they walk on average 10 times more than people who are in motor car cities say in the us and australia their obesity problems are much less some trade-offs to be made when you 're thinking about a public transport system so for people wanting to get from a to b it 's about getting there as quickly as possible so you want to make the service fast you have fewer stops but on the other hand you want people to get to where they need to go to and not have a long walking trip at the other end so there 's a trade-off between how far apart we put the stops as well as physically where they can fit it might mean that you can easily store your bike at any number of of the stops that are there and know that it 's relatively secure um you can actually readily take your bike take it onto the light rail go to the other end and go trans when you exit the light rail hop back on your bike and easily and readily pop back onto the the shared network the light rail is this sort of opportunity for people in their ordinary connected lives the routine of the day is what i think everybody 's excited about that they can see how stockholm or copenhagen or melbourne work so beautifully as this sort of seamless you move you walk down from your apartment you walk out to the street within five minutes you 're connected i would like to see the sort of city i experienced when i lived in stockholm when i saw children maybe six or seven but not much older riding on their own on the stockholm metro system without fearing for any safety issues that it was clean it was fast and it was safe and they could go to school without having their parents have to drop them off there 's plenty of examples from other parts of the world to 's a lot of energy starting to um coalesce and if we can just grab it then and really hold on to it and understand it i think canberra 's got a fantastic future ahead of it we need to think of of the capital metro as a piece of a broader picture of the sort of canberra we 'd like to see decades into the future authorised by the act government _"

    "text": "well good morning everybody yeah I now know why Frank asked me to be here he wanted to teach me a few things and and learn a little bit more about housing that I had known before I did learn a bit i learned i thoroughly enjoyed lunch keynote address this morning and i did learn a lot from that mark almost had me going back to school back to university to try and understand where he was going but i was pleased that Bendigo Bank came to the party and and showed us what you could do with the community banking and then of course at the end we had some realism in terms of what you do with debt but I have learnt a fair bit this morning Frank and I thank you for that when Frank first asked me to be here I I did wonder why the real estate institute could could be here and could contribute to this morning in a meeting for way after all real estate agents only sell or manage properties that they don 't own that somebody else 's the homeless unlike government agencies and NGOs we are rarely approached to assist those with a disability some agents in fact have difficulty dealing with someone with a disability simply because they don 't know how to handle the situation now all of that is going to change with the NDIS the industry will embrace the scheme and I must admit although just out of the womb it is a wonderful initiative when I think of those seventeen hundred plus individuals who are homeless in this city any one night of the week I shudder and ponder why providing a bed for the night or for a week won 't solve the homeless problem it 's a help but in my opinion it doesn 't restore a self-esteem provide a plan to work will maintain health and hygiene or focus and if you read the recommendations by various organizations including our own REI a they all point to getting more from government national or local there is only so much of the revenue pie that can be served around and asking government to expand public housing by 200 to 300,000 dwellings or which addresses demand be sourcing planning and supply all to be very affordable will in the main not happen my opinion all of these will be subject to Motherhood statements which I really find useless and sometimes offensive other initiatives tried tried had been inclusion razones into various developments these have affected the planning rules and added to the costs and so far haven 't_''_188.67 worked another has been a hand back of land from suburb development and this we did extensively only in the 90s where government had directed a percentage of plan to be handed back in the case of the acct was 22 a CT housing and and it was the price paid for the land was adjusted in the end that system seemed to fall away and wasn 't carried on don 't know why one that did work was providing leasing building covenants on greenfield development back in nineteen eighty-four and 85 and this was done with the then minister for territories Tom you Ren and myself AB where land was restricted to seventy percent to be solved first-time buyers and low income earners at same time it then went on and we did a number of developments that way putting hundreds of blocks on the market and that system also fell away and on yet to know why so to assist in providing some solution that might free up public housing and encourage more investment in real state let me offer this one the acct government recently increased land tax to a point where they will see many investors selling their assets which means rent will be declining costs have increased means less property being developed less for rent less construction John Miller there for Less jobs and then we 'll see rent start rise on the remaining ones this land rent tax should not put the AC T at a disadvantage to other states and should be adjusted second housing policy I believe a CT housing have about 2,000 individuals and families on their waiting list now why is someone or a couple earning in excess of ninety thousand dollars allowed to live in a government asset our asset in most cases these people and perhaps those owning more than sixty thousand dollars I understand might be around ninety four thousand dollars are in most cases asked to leave but some of them have the option of actually purchasing the dwelling and that 's selling probably in most cases very good stock in in the right locations providing proper services my opinion I don 't believe this should be allowed and and we should be adjusted net policy I would also recommend that an income test for those earning more than sixty thousand dollars be in place to tackle the two thousand on the waiting list which must help the trickle down effect of the homelessness at the bottom and put more people into public housing third the NDIS a great initiative a great initiative this will provide a wide range for many disciplines such as the homebuilding industry and no doubt John Miller will cover off on what can be achieved their the real estate industry will also benefit a lot of them don 't know it yet but involvement in the NDIS will be rewarding on quite a number of levels many here today have been involved in determining what it for themselves actually want from my perspective a few things come to mind they want to be independent I want a place of their own and I recall a development that I was involved in on the fringe called City edge in Turner probably about 12 years ago where a number of apartments were specifically designed for those with a disability with electric windows and doors lowered movable bench tops side opening doors on ovens etc and the people who live there absolutely love it people with a disability want to be able to integrate socially and they want security of tenure with their prep or tenure with the premises that they are going to occupy a six month or a tour month lease only creates anxiety by extending a lease to five to ten years does provide security and comfort and I 've no doubt that landlords will be happy to make the necessary modifications that will be necessary to have a good long term tenant and we know that most of those people with disabilities make very good tenants will search for the negative let me be a here today but me and not deliver something of substance so the real estate institute of the ATT will do this we will work with a CT housing and our very good friends at all homes we will install a kiosk a console kiosk in the shop front at a CT housing where the press of a button someone seeking accommodation at the low end of the market can get all the details of property that is available this will cover up on the style of property a photograph of it what it costs where it is who the agent is the size of it bedrooms etc it will tell them everything they need to know at the press of a button and off they go that will that will happen towards the end of August next month and all homes at ourselves and and I see em Frank to very excited about the prospect of that being installed I 'm going to take it a step further we will expand the system and I 've already spoken to all homes about it particularly their software people to specifically modify property carries a long-term lease this will be a separate section within the kiosk I think that will be most worthy thing to do and I 'll thank you and third third natick this is very important we will hold a forum more if necessary more than one for the investors for the landlords the agents and property managers to promote the opportunities associated with being a landlord with special products for special people thanks very much you _"

    "text": "hi I just want to give a quick background on myself i came across the home ground for years ago prior to that I was in property management in a regular real estate agency for 10 years so I got to a point where I was weighing up the whole let 's increase rents let 's move tennis out and put in tenants that can afford more thought about what was important for me and my social conscience went over and I moved across the home ground thought what I was doing was great tools using my expertise in a property management position in social services and here i am now again back in property management in a real estate agency but doing it differently so a home ground I 've got a video to play but home grounds just started up in march this year home ground services sorry is a not-for-profit homelessness service in melbourne one of the biggest and we saw a need for access to private rental with current public housing stocks and social housing being so sorry hard to get hold of for our clients with private rental years ago with head leasing properties so we 'd had leased from private landlords and real estate agencies to house our clients and then once we started working in that space we were able to look at what we 'd been doing over the last 15 years so we might just run this this is a little video on home ground real estate and then i 'll go on home ground real estate is a first-of-its-kind business in Australia it 's a real estate agency first and foremost so we take on market rental properties from any private landlord the final investment property they 've got a property they want to rent we take a look at the market mints in the area we charge that wrench we charge them a management fee for managing the property because we 're experts in property management that 's all we 're going to do property in tendency management home Graham setting up a real estate agency because we need a commercial venture to support the work we do in northern community we 've developed the know-how through our housing management how to do tenancy management our connections with the industry and we believe we can translate that into a commercial real estate agency venture then any money we make from doing that providing that service we are going to put into home grounds affordable housing initiative this real estate agency is a very professional operation we 're registered under the consumer affairs act as a as a real estate agency in Victoria we have the trust account we have trained real estate agents operating the agency and we have the benefit of an extremely experienced real estate professional Philip batters who is acting as our principal who signs off on all our transactions and is acting as an advisor so its a mix of that very experienced professional and our own significant experience in property and tenancy management well advertise it on our website and on real estate com and we will get the most appropriate tenant for that property based on their income their rental history where they 've lived in the past work references just like any other real estate agency these are the things that are you for your property the money that we make as a management service for the real estate agency will then subsidize other housing for people that are unable to afford private rental or that are homeless or facing homelessness so they 're very separate things just one is going to fund the other there is a bit of a crisis going on at the moment we 've got a lot of clients that are coming in to see us who are in crisis who can 't afford to pay their rent having the real estate agency we think will bring some much-needed funds to our organization so we can provide more assistance to the people we see and a wider offer of the type of housing that 's available so home ground has the expertise in housing people and matching people to the housing we don 't just have people come in and say here 's a house for you we have people come in and we talk to them we talk to them about what they need we look at the housing stock that we 've got and we the context of a commercial real estate agency that we 've created not only do we have the expertise around that side of things but we also have this huge amount of support that we can give people once they go into the property we definitely want people to have the right income to be able to afford it we don 't want to make anyone live in a property that 's unaffordable but we will give people a chance they might not be the richest but they might be the best suit they might have children and it 's near a school you know we might take those things into consideration whereas other people might not take that into consideration so if you want to apply for a property with homegrown real-estate agency you would look on our website and you would also real estate com where we look will have advertised we will show you through the property if you 're interested we will give you the application form which is the same as any other application form then we 'll go back to the offers will start work information then we will present to the landlord people who we think are the best suited as time goes by I 've looked and I 've invested and bought a property here as a residential place where one can negatively geared I 'd recommend it to anyone I go there to me there 's no difference between the home ground real estate agency if you like and any high street real estate agency they are offering the same sort of services but they 're probably catering to a different audience and for me that 's a much better well I think that it 's just home ground taking its own business into its own hands rather than lobbying government and relying on funding from some other party where we 're making this happen ourselves which is a really really brilliant I think so in march issue we opened home ground real estate from march issue and now I think we 're managing just over 70 properties Phillip Enders be who was up on that film we started with two of his properties last week I took on another two 's willing to give to us two of which her at a low cost rental so as Heather said in our CEO in the presentation why did we start home ground real estate it was a way of broadening they come at a golf here so a way of broadening our housing options for clients tenants and also to create a funding stream that would then support housing so service delivery cost is covered in management fees we within yep give a dash additional housing provision and support to home ground clients with any of the profits derived from the management of properties we 've got an extensive experience homegrown real estate is right at home ground managing in excess of 300 properties for lust 50 up to 15 years for department of human services in Melbourne and they use that expertise along with myself and my colleagues to put together the real estate agency and also to make a change where we can access properties of land laws that are well located within reasonable distance to services and proximity to public transport which wouldn 't necessarily be available to Melbourne the affordability crisis is out of control tenants can 't afford to live in the inner cities that have been done up housing expensive and we 're finding that the stock that is affordable is in the outer suburbs where the services aren 't necessarily available to them so by providing housing and accommodation within the inner suburbs where the services that are available we can make a real difference on to the next one so how do we work we 've got three different levels we go out into the market as a real estate agency offering our services on a purely commercial basis so we 'll take your property will lease it for you will charge you a standard seven point seven percent negotiable of course and we 'll use any profits derived back into our community services the second is an affordable situation where we 've got landlords are in a position now they may or in their property they may be looking at redeveloping down the track that can give us their property to lease out at an affordable rent so an example is a schools close to the beach I 'd love to live there myself the landlord 's owned it for 25 years she 's now in a position where she can offer it to a family for think it was thirty five percent less than market rent so we 've put that out we 've now got a tenancy in there which is a young mum who 's studying working part-time her partner who 's on disability services and their 18 month old daughter they 'd never be able to afford to live where they are now they were out in the outer suburbs they 'll finding it hard to live but we 've got a landlord there that 's dropped his rent sorry her rent and can afford to do that on a long-term basis because she 's in a position to give back without actually putting her hand in her pocket and producing money each month to give to charity she thinks it 's fantastic and we 've got more than a handful of landlords coming on board now doing the same thing and the third level is a philanthropic stage we 've got four properties i think it is now where we 've got landlord sort of large trusts where they 've got excessive properties they give them to us at cost to us so we pay for water rates will pay for and maintenance and works on it but we don 't actually pay them a rent and then when we 're able to use that housing stock as long-term housing for homeless people that are in a position that just need a support spot we charge them twenty-five percent of the income and that income goes back into maintaining the property whenever we 've had some fantastic work being done with local councils the city of yarra has forgone forgone the rent sorry the rates on those properties so we 're not paying rates on those properties it was just about asking the question we 're using this property for homelessness can you give us a discount and now they 're willing to pay not give us a complete cost savings on that and again with approaching insurance companies for the insurance we 're asking for rates 've got properties I picked up a property last week a landlord 's charging two thousand five hundred dollars a week on a property is given us at to manage so that 's a fantastic pick up for us but then we 've got them at the other end of the scale where we have a rooming house we 've picked up with seven properties that 's been existing insecure and used by home ground services for the last twenty odd years the landlord is just an older gentleman in a position where he 's wanting to step back and those rooms are 170 a week so we 've got a scale of 1 72 at this stage to two thousand five hundred dollars a week but all of those profits from the management are going back into subsidizing housing which has been great and it 's just really about asking a question do you have something that you can give rather than charging a rent at a full rinse so it 's been great so where we 're at we 're fully licensed and operational we 've got a been in real estate for in excess of 25 years he 's highly regarded but he 's come to us in a pro bono so he 's still working in the sector but he 's giving us his services backing us up looking out for us for free giving back he 's in a position now in his career where he can give back and again it was about us going out into the sector and asking what can you give back what can you do for us how can you help us achieve what we want to achieve and we 've got a portfolio over around 75 and I 'm happy to say I picked up another two last night at about eleven o 'clock last night I 'll sending out feverishly sitting there in the hotel room filling out authorities ticking the boxes let 's get them out tonight because I promised the people i had so it 's been really good which is a fantastic take-up rate so far in four months to go from zero at 75 and we 're just hoping to grow further and on the day that we launched we had a lady and I think she 's in her 60s she just turned 60 sorry she 's unemployed she came into our office she 'd heard about us heard about him on the Triple R on the radio she came into our office asking her what can you do for me we had no properties under management on this day that we launched she came to us she told us her story she 'd been working as an assistant an assistance worker I can 't_''_839.08 I 'm not sure I had to describe a carer so she had been working as a carer for all of her career and in-home care and she said she was at a position where she was wanting to give that up and have her in place which he had very little superelevation no savings no accommodation and she 'd been couchsurfing for you know six to twelve months and so when we heard her story we 're just thinking this is these are the kind of people that we can help with plugging a space in she 's not going to be attractive to a normal real estate agency that 's running quickly and fast and and doesn 't have that time to sit and work things out and it just happened that within two weeks we had an owner come to us a little flood in South Yarra the shape they lived in the block they 'll willing to give this property up at an affordable rental but they had very very specific needs they knew everyone in the block they wanted an older couple or an older lady that had no kids and no pets and we were really you know okay we won 't have we 're going to do our best and then it that they like more light blue light globe moment came what about Faye Faye who came in on the first day first thing we did we rang her we got our down there we let us have a look through phase now living there she was our first success our first property our first tenant had just fell together so simply and now that 's what we 're new listing we 're looking at the people we know Phil who 's got the four he 's got two of them vacant at the moment which we picked up last week he 's got them over tires at full rent but he said to me if you can find tenants that need them low rent go for it just let me know about it so we 're going to our private rental brokerage workers for ourselves and the other organizations in the area telling them about the property saying you have a look at it online it 's three-thirty a week but we can do something with that so this owner particularly is fantastic for us because he 's given us four properties but he 's also willing to look at the okay if I get market rent that 's great but if I can help somebody that 's even better but he doesn 't want to go out and put it up on the internet at 280 a week and just give it away to someone that can afford to pay 330 so we 're just asking those both of them just mum and dad investors wanting to help the cause wanting to give back but like Melanie said to me last night we don 't have the money in our pocket to go out and give give give but by allowing you to manage our property we can give back and that gives us a feel-good factor so how is our project funded we use fill-ins philanthropy local councils to give us backing in-kind support in con support and internal resources so internal resources being the people and the power we had within our organization and the expertise our real estate principle being Philip butters philanthropic contributions the owners that have allowed us to manage their properties and an are asking for anything in return but also we 've been able to get grants from the mercy foundation and the Lord Mayor 's charitable for our terrible trust funds and at the moment we 've been working with real estate com they 've come on board and given us access to advertising at no cost which is a big one for us it 's fantastic for them at the same time just being able to put our properties up on real estate com at no cost means we can use those profits to go back into more housing of the two properties that we 've got managed to fulfill at the moment that have tenants in them one of them is a low income but we also top that up because they 're two gentlemen live there two brothers they 're from sedan they have no income they have very little means or ability they can 't work so homegrown are contributing to their rent through the prophets we 're making from other properties and managing them which has been great what 's helped well homegrowns reputation in housing over the last 15 years we 've had a really supportive board the board 's been willing to take a chance to use some of our our cash that we 've got so we had some cash reserves and they 've been able to use that to leverage and move on other housing options that we 've got in the pipeline as well home grounds got 58 affordable got a board that 's willing to muck take a risk and to ask those questions and to put it out there to the public do you have rental properties do you have the ability to they 're doing their best to expose us and homegrown real-estate to people that we wouldn 't necessarily have the ability to touch which has been great and the community and business supports in the area and that 's about it my thing I wanted to ask is just how many people in the room actually have access to owners of private rental and have you ever asked that question of are you willing to take it take part of your income and how will I put it sort of just take a cut on your rental to allow access to people that are in need and just so that we can unlock what 's already there we 've got quite a housing stock in Melbourne the private rental max markets huge but we 've never really asked before it 's always been about put your rent up market the market rent at the could afford to put up five dollars we not take it down a notch and our salon lords well where are you really at can you afford would you be willing to will you drop your rent can you give me access to your property for a longer period of time to be able to you know give tenants two three four year tenure if a landlord has that idea that their investments long-term why can 't we look at residents tenancies being long-term so that they 're not locked in a cycle of next property next property and would any of the agents in the area or in the acct be willing to set up a portfolio within your agency where owners can come to you with properties of that nature and you just give back those profits to the an organization so the idea of we 're looking at down the track Melbourne is a really big space I 've just picked up property in hoppers crossing which is in the West and one in barrack which is right there a good hour and 20 minutes between them can see our properties they 'll manage them on our behalf or for other organizations that have the ability to attract property for a small fee and then give that profit so creating space where existing real estate agencies can work towards providing for the community organizations and providing management for those kind of different areas things _"

    "text": "very much to see that great to see you all and for those medical students who either never get off the am dial or haven 't_''_12.469 got a clue a radio national is you can always pod classes and so but thank you very much and congratulations so that was you for most of the last hour to theaters some great presentations and I and all about transitions over search into clinical practice and I 'm going to talk a little bit upstream and I know that there are some are need web managers in the room some curiosity driven researchers and you might feel a little bit beaten up by the end of the hour but it 's a serious issue which we need to confront what is the issue well the issue is that we did quite well in terms of our research publication so by where I don 't show carbon particles coming from radio it 's also very see that you see but not hair so there won 't be any car was to institute do not three per cents for the world 's publications might impact the iron journal before that will support which is called the virtuous cycle and this is the idea that in fact you do perceptions recycled into discovery and into practice in the clinic their information review hypotheses in its virtuous cycle or perceptions practice but it 's often for a hope in the reality and what is going wrong we are a lot of the way the jump ball born the king Michael Milken spent many years several years in jail or constipation various financial activities and has been trying to redeem himself ever since and others use the phrase the value of it and that will be a new face two fundamental researchers in the shrimp the valley of death is and the notion that you 've got a huge investment we have a huge investment many billions of dollars inspiration out of all the research is based in the health sector industry but if you actually that sort of all that researchers on one side of the valley generating discovery and then only a little bit drills to the other side which is at innovation index of useful ideas useful diagnostics which actually never see the light it and why does that happen what is the problem they are in Australia and I the NHMRC is concern about is they know creative created a translation faculty which was two thousand eight hundred members has 14 steering groups the NHMRC is good at a call for people to vie for the title of advanced research and translation centers and people are calling all over themselves to become such within an environment where we are 116 for the list so you have to assume that not very many people who are applying actually doing very much using translation so it might be advanced health research centers I 'm not aware of any advanced translational research centers Australia so this is an aspiration so we 'll get at it we love you very much new place and it 's sometimes hard to know who the best on so what is going on and unconsciously determining medical students in the room the reception enterprise and incentives if you 've got several days of presentation research around this precinct a research is research people who take up research or do people they 're clever people we can be lots of other things with the virus but they choose to have low incomes uncertainty comes and careers that bounced around remove all their own the filmmakers fun the problem is i think and i thought the advantage nemesis compartir this strongly is that the structure of research in the way we found it and lately rewarded in mitigates against useful discovery is a claim so once you have an aspherical is that all and because it 's doable to do you researchers end up a successful researcher you end up thinking I can 't_''_312.81 be bothered anymore University bureaucracy or Hospital be obviously i 'm going to set up my own Institute so I 've got some independence to do I want to do in up and people we are in our builders the Google silos by the way silos are necessary bad things for 25 you know the

you 'll has had over many years substantial government investments both it lacked in many ways high-net-worth donations ever tasted ultra my apology so do well for muscular researchers funeral air warriors possible possibly more than we merit by population level so you get these empires empires are built on reputation they are built on gaining credit for your Institute for discoveries names so that behind net worth individuals keep on donating money to reduce to tour the world Institute I 'm not talking about people here involved in criminal activities we 're trying to conserve the time of the sculptures mitigates but what happens then is that people tend to work in some places where people collaborate where the people overseas than people around the corner we 've got good into almost all frontline researchers have very good international networks of people they 're collaborating with but they 're often collaborating with people just like them so it 's you know the examining one molecular pathway and they know they know everybody in that molecular pathway but it 's also highly competitive there are no prizes in biomedical science for being second you got to be first and so this game playing that goes on because you don 't your collaborators have also seen as your competitors so you 've got to be first with your results so the sort of game playing that goes on is they don 't want because they know if they 're doing something really easy tarek they there are only a limited number of reviewers for the grants and they don 't want the reviewers to know too much about what they 're doing because they even though reviewers are supposed not supposed to do anything with that information very hard to avoid leakage so what for research they 've already done and they use that money for research to advance the pineal that you even further you can say this is dishonest is it for what have you that 's a moot point it 's not it 's just it might it but it is game playing and so you want to be first you want to get the recognition and you get rewarded for that by the system you don 't get rewarded necessarily NHMRC struggling with us you don 't necessarily get rewarded for a practical discovery and I 'll give you an example of the perverse incentives in a moment you get rewarded for you being first with the paper and the high-impact journal that turns out to be well sited now when we 're dealing with things like cancer or various cancers we 're talking about wicked problems which are really difficult to solve and we want really good people who know a lot about a little but the mutt and the market if you like fails you won 't find venture capitalists or the private sector wanting to invest in delve into molecular about biomedical who are doing highly detailed fundamental biomedical research they 're not the slightest bit interested in that because the discovery rate even to get to the one side of the valley of death is quite low they 're not even interested by the way in taking a promising molecule to the next stage because one reason for the valley of death and I 'm betting around a little bit here but one reason even if you get to the point where you 've got something useful and I would argue the structure of biomedical research both here and overseas mitigates against discovery of even the promising molecule at the beginning of the valley of death the height what the bear then you 've got all sorts of other problems because you 've got a pipeline of innovation that needs to occur for things to be slaughtered in so you might have a useful molecule and it looks really promising in in mouse models for venture capitalists to be interested in taking this to the next stage they wanted was called D risk they want it the other side before they will come in with their capital to take it further so for example you might have a molecular target you 've designed a molecule it 's useful in mice and you want to go to the next stage which would be further preclinical testing and then maybe a phase one trial for it to get you a phase one trial you 've got to say that all for example to a medicine or chemist there aren 't many good groups in that in Australia who then take your molecule and make it into a better molecule that 's worth trialing and maybe even then take it to a phase one trial so you do more advanced animal work and then you get it to the point where you 've got a really refined molecule that could then go to a phase one trial which is a safety trial team at that point venture capitalists start to become interested and pharmaceutical companies start to become interested so the market if you like fails right through to the uphill of the valley of death now the 2800 the 14 steering groups are all faffing around in different parts of it they may be doing important stuff but the key thing is to get those molecules at one side of the valley and to actually have the translational pipeline well in place so that you slot into that process with your intellectual property guarded I want to spend a bit of time talking about if you like when my since the left-hand side of the valley and the generation of useful products which might be taken further because I actually don 't think that we are doing well enough in getting to that point the United States is something a consortium of 60 clinical translational research centers we have a national approach to the UK 's impressiveness well we 're not alone in this area but for many of these prod problems that we 're trying to crack it 's not the expertise is not in one group so when it come back to market failure let me just state what my argument is my argument is that you need to actually get significant discovery to get to table that you 've never even met imagine should be there and the one person who 's missing consistently is the consumer because the pot you can say well researchers have got to a lot to lose if the research project doesn 't succeed because it 's their career but the people who have really got skin in the game or consumers are people with the problem and you 've got to bring the right people to the table to start answering the problem and they usually do not exist in one institution so I 'll give you a few examples of how this is happening overseas and a little bit here and how it 's just one part of the problem but let me finish with market failure because government because industry I mean this government we got now likes to think and I think the Labour government for hand like to think but the market will solve everything it will solve some stuff markets really good at getting products to market you know developing products and then getting them to market markets are terrible at providing health care 're terrible at providing fundamental research so the role of the NHMRC and the aarc is to develop really good researchers who increasingly know a hell of a lot about a little and but the but the raw I am arguing today is of philanthropy philanthropy needs to consolidate and organize and become much more assertive and aggressive so that once tax Australian taxpayers have trained these fantastic researchers philanthropy should be pulling them out of the foxhole and looking while widely to see how they could solve important problems the tradition in philanthropy around the world and in Australia is we will gather money together my loved one died of breast cancer or pancreatic cancer or multiple sclerosis and I will create a foundation in their memory and we will find good research to find a cure for this dreadful disease but they 're deluded they are absolutely deluded if they follow the traditional pathway and the traditional pathway is I get a few hundred thousand dollars or a few million dollars together really well thought you 'll kill people who care about this the money together but what want researchers to apply to them with their best ideas for research well that 's fantastic that 's a good thing to do we 've got clever people generate ideas but what you then find is that immunologist supply for diabetes research because they think that well I could tweak my research to make that leap like a diabetes project and everybody starts off their research line with if this if my research succeeds it will result in better therapies for cancer blah blah blah and then they get a few of the researchers to sit on panels to review those and the best research the rest research gets funded so it 's not that lousy research gets funded highly competitive and good research is funded from this philanthropic money but it doesn 't get cures it very rarely gets better treatments very rarely gets things into practice so what 's emerging is much more assertive philanthropy around the world and it 's beginning to hit in Australia so let me give you some examples a group in London at the University College London it is to co-op farm already macular degeneration and an anonymous donor from the agency 's give him some money and the money was conditional on them working towards an effective treatment for wet for macular degeneration within five years and put I think five million u.s. dollars on the table I wasn 't five million pounds I can 't remember now and pick coffee at the Institute ophthalmology and apologists there took up the challenge it was called the London London project against blindness i think it is called and but the donor insisted on project management milestones and the implicit threat was there if you weren 't reaching the milestones we were going to pull the plug on your money give it somebody else so they organized themselves they looked around for who they needed and they weren 't necessarily in a university college london they also knew they needed industry involved and eventually gathered about 20 million dollars of money leveraged and on five years almost to the day after that money was donated and project started they had a product going through regulatory approval and is now going through the clinical trials 's a hell of a lot faster than others of fun I came across another one just by accident I had an eye problem when I was in I was in Seattle and I had an eye problem I had to see a retinal surgeon on a Sunday morning and very lightly scratch very kindly saw me and didn 't charge me with great relief because I wasn 't insured anyway almost ingratitude I started engaging him in conversation about what research he was doing at the university of washington seattle and he said I 'll I do this and that but the really interesting thing I 'm doing now is in a topic that I 've got absolutely no interest in so he told me the story that he had a patient a young woman with a dreadful condition called Usher 's 3 where I did pediatrics and you 're supposed to know these small problems but artistries you become deaf and blind in adolescence is a terrible condition her father was immensely wealthy he 's one of the first people into hedge funds of hedge funds whatever that about and he had been giving money to a major foundation in the united states that researchers blindness but had been doing it in the traditional way we 're calling me or given large sums of money and calling for grants calling for people to put in their best ideas you 've got nowhere so the guy this father in frustration said to this ophthalmologist he said look I will build you and your own Institute devoted to this condition this gotten the optimal to say the come up interesting means to die don 't want to do this you know all due respect I don 't this is not my research area but you said give me a couple of million bucks and let me see what I can do so he created a foundation and what he did because he knew who was who he found that money out on project driven research within the within a year they had a candidate target the you at the defect was in the gene so for after years of giving money in an undirected way by farming the research out who weren 't necessarily researching this area they got further than it we got further in one year than other people had got in many years the cystic fibrosis cystic fibrosis foundation in the United States we 're getting very very frustrated got large money largest amounts of money promising their donors that they were looking for the cure or effective treatments for cystic fibrosis and no new molecules for about 15-20 years like DNA 's was the last useful molecule so we 're changing the way this is the consumer piece so we 're changing the way we 're doing business we 're not going to take this anymore we 've almost been pathetically grateful to researchers in the past that 's over we are actually going to give our money to discovery we want new treatments and we 're going to manage them and we 're not going to take from anyone so they started a very aggressive approach which also had a business model attached to it we created a company and which are not for profit company which actually shared in the IP and they directed day in terms of getting new treatments for cystic fibrosis and from there having been no new molecules and development there are no five going through clinical but I 've just got beyond preclinical testing not only other five new molecules emerging from this work some of which won 't work one of which works for a think about five percent of people because it 's such a long jean with so many defects in it you 'll probably want to get small parts of the population but they 're not actually effectively have a cure for a very small group of C or people with CF and they 're also testing other products which weren 't in clinical trial at all so you know they still vest a little bit in fundamental research but a lot and rubber sell myeloma foundation doing the same sort of thing and the LOI family whoo-hoo-hoo and westfield corporation they haven 't running in their family a rare degenerative condition of the macula called macular to inject asia and they 're doing the same thing so they they have the fun research and who in this and who needs to be brought in and they are managing forward I don 't think they 've got a cure yet but I think things are moving reasonably quickly so it 's not passive research so I tried this out so I mean I 've been going on about this for a while and taught a little story I have a personal interest in pancreatic cancer some members of my family have had it and people are close to me in Carol the husband of a husband of Geraldine Duke had pancreatic cancers and my closest friends and didn 't want to do something about it and I got involved with a Research Foundation a charitable foundation called Abner 's after a senior executive at Woolworth 's who died of pancreatic cancer and Woolworths and coca-cola Amatil have got behind this foundation and they 've generated quite a lot of income and they started off by funding projects in those individual studies and they fell over and they started losing confidence in their investment strategy for the money that they had and I was having a said well why don 't we take a punt on this assertive stroke aggressive approach to pancreatic cancer research money so what we did was and this and because individual so we 've got individually we 've got some very good pancreatic cancer researchers they tend to be in Queensland Sydney and a Western Australia to some extent and Mel burns a bit light on actually with pancreatic cancer research which is unusual so strong and other things but anyway we bought so we gathered what this foundation did was funded people to come together for a weekend to talk about a national pancreatic cancer research strategy what I did then what I but what I did in the background was I surveyed pancreatic cancer researchers and other cancer researchers around the world to say what are the opportunities here if you were to invest in that where would you put your money to compare that to what the locals thought and then I brought p and I brought people into the room who 'd never done any pancreatic cancer research at all but who were very good biologists and talk to each other in their own language they had people some of whom were much better than they were in the better stronger track records and cancer research just not in their field but that wasn 't enough in my view because I 'd looked at what other people had done another what other people have done was they try to shake up the thinking and get people to think in a different way very hard to do when you 've been down in your foxhole for 20 years of your career so I brought business people in the room where people have really successful in business really good minds and I brought one group in the room who are a big data company called quantum they 're actually half on by Woolworths and they know more about you and I than we know about ourselves you know they know what magazine you read if you buy a mango and Woolies you know things like that in fact interestingly these big data companies who are in retail not in health I think have the secrets for some of your these people buying where you can imagine what they 're buying but do you really no do you know which were worse or calls they 're buying it in how how would you actually change their behavior because we don 't we just faff around at the edges in terms of health promotion and health interventions big data people have actually got the targeted information to make it happen but that 's but let 's buy the buy but it is about translation of really good work in epidemiology into product we don 't have the right people at the table but coming back to this room so to the founders of quantum came for this all week an incredibly give them a sort of three billion dollar businesses I mean give us a weekend at that time was fantastic so to give you an idea what happens when you have that sort of conversation a really eminent researcher really eminent researcher from Melbourne who studies apoptosis programmed cell death so most people a lot so one of the reasons you can get cancer is that sells don 't die standing up when I camera bought the context was but he was standing up and saying look one of the problems is even when you 've got genetically identical mice you don 't get the same effect from the experiment you get random effects and its really annoying and the Greg Schneider from quantum stood up it 's it you know professor I didn 't understand a single word you said until you use the word random and give his head root up he said nobody in my company is allowed to use the word random so this is like you know this is core businesses stats and maths and nobody 's allowed because there 's no such thing as random or if there is such a thing as random is an incredibly rare event you 're just using that to hide during her ignorance because you don 't really something 's happening with those mice but you you 're blaming it on a random effect when who actually might be something serious so and this research is a lovely guy in the researcher he went white not because of on so what did we it took me a week and this is how entrenched the barriers are to collaboration every talks about collaboration and being a good thing it 's not necessarily a good thing there are lots of costs attached to collaboration there 's time there 's money effort and so on so collaborations got to be worth it and of course there are no prizes for collaboration if you 're being distracted from an experiment you 're doing that you know you 're going to actually get a result from and you 'll get a publication and you 'll get abstracts and you 'll get your next two to three years of your postdoc or a chair so there 's lots of disadvantages to collaboration to me a whole weekend to get people close to it and also close to the counterintuitive stuff because we think that research is the only thing that 's going to get you to get us there and one of the people in the steering group for this is john salzburg from the that stage of peter maccallum in melbourne and he here is the double survival in the next five years people pancreatic cancer five to ten percent said okay well if you want to double survival here 's one way of getting your a few extra points on on the percentage which any order a statistic which I actually already knew but hadn 't translated is is that your survival varies by twofold with pancreatic cancer depending on who your GP refers you to twofold so your Canberra you got very limited options but had no idea what the patter billary surgeons are here like and but if you are referred to our well organized hip atterbury unit who do lots of pancreatic cancer surgery who are well organized teams so but sixty percent of this is the hospital on the team and of a for two percent the skill of the surgeon then you 're twice as likely to live longer then if you 're sent to somebody who pretends to be a batter billary surgeon does the occasional operation and doesn 't have a team more importantly probably probably very good surgeon but doesn 't have a team they collect the best information in Australia in this in New South Wales with but with bowel cancer particularly lower bowel cancer or rectal cancer the difference in survival is even bigger so he said if you could just guarantee that everybody goes who 's referred with pancreatic cancer goes to an centre of excellence and pancreatic cancer you 're going to you know raise your survival rates I mean obviously it 's a smaller group who are operable but it 's a small group so one of the things that we had to drive people to is actually could you actually set up a set of clinical standards by which you would judge pancreatic cancer units and that people would aspire to well that was one of the outcomes of the weekend but by god who took a lot of time to get there then what was clear from the group was that and you 've got multiple groups with their own mouse models you know they do these hybrids with a graft on the tumor and they 've got a certain genetic profile and they 've all got got the national proteome facility here in camera with what 's and most models but they tend to focus on their own and what happens talking about the valley of death we get a promising molecule the test it in their mouse model doesn 't work link or it 's promising and then the grant runs out they lose their post Docs and then somebody 25 years from now see our Sunday JC mr had a really good idea 25 years ago whatever happened to it because the money around out the NHMRC didn 't renew he 's going to get seventeen percent success rate or the only tested in one model and a work that might have worked in two more so what they came up with in this group again took agony and six months later it 's still not organized despite a million dollars a year from this foundation being on the table a million dollars a year is to do parallel processing where they 'd share their mouse models promising molecules are due in parallel link for the clinicians so that you 're actually doing real in two years so you actually don 't need much benefit to see the result you probably don 't need many phase three randomized trials and so you have this parallel preclinical testing going into clinical testing that was what we came up with still not in place despite a lot of money being on the table that 's how hard it is to do so the NHMRC can golf for the translation faculty the 2800 members there 14 steering groups they got to solve that problem before they even get to the problem of how you plug in venture capital and get people how you d risk what you 're finding because if they find the molecule it 's promising then you 're still going to actually have to commercialize it in the end and do something with it and have and move forward and in many ways we have the beginnings of that structure here but it 's getting people to collaborate on solving these difficult problems up front and bringing new minds to the table but my argument is that unless consumers and philanthropist drive it it been slamming into the NH neymar see the NH neymar sees job i think is to build big and significant research human and physical infrastructure or we don 't build physical infrastructure very much at all in austria so we have this research patched in the street is familiar with the aarc we expect results from that but we 're kind of asking an organization which is built for one thing to do another I think we should be using philanthropy to take that next step but here 's the problem you 've got empires in philanthropy too and so you 've got all these pity little charities all over the place some of them aren 't people aren 't piddly but they 're all doing their own little thing and they 're frightened to collaborate because then they would lose the ability there 's their identity in able to which enables them to raise money for their future activity it 's not they 're doing bad stuff it 's just that because we do so much better stuff and people know this so for example Cancer Council Australia has to try and consolidate some of these pretty little research charities some are not so clearly to try and cooperate so you actually gets energy and moving forward because that 's what we need we 're not going to get it I think from government organizations we are going to have to move forward because it does mean more of a commercial focus or an outcomes focus for people to do what consumers want if you 're a parent of a child with cystic fibrosis you want that child to live a normal life span and if you 've got money and donate it that 's what you wanted to make your money too but at the moment you don 't you think you do but you don 't so donors have got to ask more of the charities and charities have got to get together consolidate their money because we are not great philanthropist in Australia into a large leaks of money and make ambitious and bold investments now you may ask what happens to curiosity-driven research serendipity we 're great discoveries are made well we have a multi-billion is we 've got more than enough serendipity but tell me where the results are there haven 't been many studies of this two researchers called conroe and drips did a fascinating study i think it was in the late 60s some of you may have read it worth looking up where they from memory they looked up they actually said we 've got open heart surgery what where how much of the discoveries how many of the disk or proportion of the discoveries that led to open heart surgery where serendipitous curiosity-driven and what proportion were directed at the actual job at hand we want to actually be able to operate on hearts and do something about it and it was a large reporters no question was a large proportion was curiosity-driven research not necessarily serendipitous Bruce curiosity so your Harvey discovery of the floor blood the discovery of electricity goes back to all that when you think about what you need in place to be able to do open-heart surgery but a very substantial proportion was not curiosity driven it was directed at the aim we want to valves correct the defects and the same for adults we need both but we 've got more than enough serendipity we need to get organized we need to plan and we need to try and achieve targets and most of this research will feel it feels already and the hope is that less will feel there 's nothing wrong in failure but at least its failure trying to achieve something useful so if you know a handy philanthropist perhaps convince them about assertive philanthropy moving forward and health research thank you very much of course I 've insulted enough people in the room thanks very much me I agree with with everything you 've said enough particularly agree with the idea universities or the MSC to change the way in which they operate is almost nil keep the g8 noodles we would scar protection cap but I mean what what do they get a hundred and two countries tell us about what they do I guess with someone hand me my baby as well it 's it 's a funny index actually because of some surprising countries down near the the top but I think I don 't think Singapore is that high for example we all talk about Singapore so I think that we have we have an underdone venture capital industry in Australia which is very risk averse so that you have it 's getting better but they don 't like you know it 's very risk-averse so you what you find in the United States is they will pick up so this D risk this be risking which we have to invest in in the valley here to get people at the other side there 's less d risking that needs to happen in the United States there 's probably less of a stigma and more role models for science and health entrepreneurs in the u.s. situation and in some other countries it 's so that it 's not seen you know Lou down your nose as a bad career move so so kids going into science think that they could actually make money out of science I think that 's an important thing so people are looking for things that they could make money out of sort of hunger for for that sort of innovation and we do have those people in Australia and they are creating new businesses of course one of the problems here is that because they don 't pick up Australian venture capital they often end up picking up American venture capital and then what happens is the mentor the American venture capital companies start screwing them down and it becomes much easier for them to operate out of the United States so we lose biotech companies use companies like resume to the United States because becomes easier for them to go into capital markets in the United States with a u.s. resident company because capital markets here are so risk-averse I think that 's a major it 's a major issue and then we 've got to think hard about how we reward individual researchers and the same debate goes on here any NIH isn 't or MRC aren 't that different to NH no Marcy in terms of how the reward researchers but there is a bit more of a career path if you go in to translate and reward trying to look at this but it is hard when global research works on a different paradigm yes that 's absolutely right and even when you 've got a good reputation so on the health report on Monday I had John hopper talking about this pathway gene to brca2 in breast cancer called poly to and the findings there that this is as significant a gene for breast cancer as brca1 brca2 with tenfold increase risk but he 's doing very complicated work using supercomputer consuming and Kieran melbourne on multiple snips across the genome hundreds if not thousands of snips across the genome trying to actually further identify breast cancer subtypes he says it 's just getting really hard for journals to even accept that because it 's a different paradigm they 're used to single gene analyses and so and he 's a well published researcher in this area so such a serendipity is just changing your science and it 's another is another issue science has its fads and it 's very hard to shake them from their fans levia have toyed with the idea of crowdfunding have a lot of have you can you give us any insights as to the success or there 's a bit going on but i can 't give you the numbers numbers there the fascinating story about crowd sourcing solutions so Nicholas gruen who some of the name of you would know groans a well-known Canberra name who 's an economist and swallow fragran economist at this university think was the founder of the economics faculty but Nicholas with others created a company called kangal and Cagle is no based in America but and it crowd-sourced solutions for mathematical modeling so they created competitions and and so there were prizes for this and they just put the problems out there so some of them were biomedical and some of them wearing so for example they they had one which was about traffic flow on the f 54 freeway in Sydney how do you watch the model there and it was won by somebody in Toronto who came up with quite a good model then they put out one on early growth dynamics of HIV and I think it was won a group that because you want to try and find the other it 's fine wanting to know the molecular structure and shape of three-dimensional shape of viruses but it actually is quite hard because it 's constantly moving and you 've got to find the least energetic state or so I think was HIV they put out a competition using video game technology because you actually had they gave the players the parameters about what would be the least energetic state but it required multiple calculations and I think it was won by 14 year old who just played this game and then there 's this thing called Galaxy Zoo which is worth looking up where astronomers have done the equivalent of the human genome project but in the sky and they 've done a digital survey of the sky go all these objects and then they reckon it worked in 30 years to analyze it so they put this out to the crowd and I think all they had to do initially was classified spiral from a spiral from a helical something like fire from helical galaxies and a day and it 's they 'd finished it within a no time at all then we moved on to the next thing and in fact a teacher in these where astronomers are doing this is just a general public they like the idea of the sky and in a teacher in Holland called henny came up with a new astronomical object from this thing which nobody knew what it was there was like a green object so I think the Dutch was vervoort so it 's Hanny 's reward which has now created a whole new research project for astronomers finding this new object that nobody also noticed before so the crowd can be used but I don 't know very much about finding sorry I 'm such a long answer to a short question Peter as possible and to follow international best practice it is an issue lunch is corner

    "text": "that we are all participating and now all those results are on my hospitals and fed back to all of you and so Lindsey is the driver of that who 's funny together and makes it keep on going he 's also spent quite a length of time at Geneva with WH o where he again was very much involved in rolling out international programs on antimicrobial use and resistance in people around the world and while there he obviously made a lot of contacts because the program we 've got in Australia the five moments is based very much on what is now being promoted by WH o in DDA Ruchi from Geneva which is a worldwide program so Australia and Switzerland with DDA are at the forefront of this and Lindsay is a major person involved Lindsay 's has numerous publications but he also is the editor of a major if you like textbook of infectious diseases on antimicrobials which is called coaches which is probably the gold standard for this information around the world so I think we 're now ready to go so without any further which is something I might say I have a lot of interesting which is superbugs and supermarkets thanks very much Peter for that very kind introduction I have been accused in any microphone before so thanks that you 've taken apart my time and thanks to Hanna in the organizing committee for inviting me to speak today so what I thought we would cover today is firstly the current situation regarding antimicrobial resistance and new drug development problem new bacteria and mobile resistance five practical steps towards controlling the situation without a new drug some of you will have heard this before concept of one health of which Peters obviously been a key leader in Australia and white food is the new frontier and then finally what we can do about it here in Australia so if you were in Mart and Mars and you were looking down on the earth whether you 're from my favorite Martian long time of you go or a Martian like this you 'd see the following and that is that prior to 1940 there were no antibiotics that these wounded drugs are invented years that 's two to three human generations antibiotics have now been misused such that we have rapidly emerging multi-drug resistance whether in gram positives gram negatives TB or in other organisms like Clostridium difficile so my mum was born in 1928 about you know 12 to 13 years before penicillin was invented she 'd if the whole lifetime as a child without any antibiotics but by the time she died we were already having in my hospital four to five patients a year dying with bugs that couldn 't be treated any more so not her entire lifetime this change had occurred so it 's little wonder that same Delhi saying Dame silly Davies from the UK has likened the emergence of antibiotic resistance to that of terrorism and its effect on the world so it 's a infectious disease physician I think one of the things we do do for the public is confuse them with terms like gram-positive and gram-negative when they don 't know what a Gram stain is so perhaps we could talk about bugs in terms of four categories those are the skin based Acinetobacter usually you can intervene with topical things such as alcohol based hand rub nose and throat infections respiratory pathogens that is such a strep pneumo and he mufflers largely responsive to vaccinations actually sexually transmitted disease which is hard to control requires condoms or a change in personal behavior and no one uses any intellect below the navel so this is a problem and is probably why we now have multi resistant gonorrhea that is completely untreatable with any currently available antibiotic just discovered in the Philippines and then finally atopic manly for today of gastrointestinal and URI infections where the gut flora and the pathogens associated with the gut such as into a bacteria a CA and VRE commonly caused generally tract sepsis obviously because the anatomy is pretty close to each other so recently this summary came out from w-h-o summarizing the recent status of antibiotic resistance where they for the first time actually surveyed all of the available data from labs reporting resistance across the world and as you 'll see from the right-hand column there the five or six w-h-o regions are now recording resistance to a coli Klebsiella the majority of the sites are recording high levels of resistance so this is not just a simple problem in one or two locations and in fact for those of you who followed this story about NDM or new delhi matelo that 'll act amazed this is this new strain of E coli and other gram negatives that carry multi resistant genes that it seems to emerge particularly in India and of course with migration now that 's popping up all through UK and that you can see that the number of isolates has gone up dramatically and then a number of antibiotics to which it 's acceptable is minimal so that now we 're doubt left with really Calista and teacher cyclin if you have one of these infections and that if this is a map of New Delhi from the recent publications showing that the green sites of whether a drinking water taps where this bug was grown from the drinking water and the red sites where it was growing it just in puddles on the surface water or the soil around New Delhi Delhi population now has this multi resistant strain of e.coli colonizing their gut that bug that will be hard to remove and obviously when they get there their intra-abdominal sepsis so they you 're each accepts us that it 's more likely now to be with this multi resistant organism acquired through the food through a contaminated water than it is there previously non resistant strain of e.coli so of course for some of us weak from Australia 's point of view this these bugs can be brought back in terms of travelers returning where they 've had medical care overseas or being traveling overseas and this is a paper by curator in our group where we summarized a group of recently returned travelers who 'd spent time in hospitals overseas and if you look at this map you can see that the different areas to where Australians go for travel so that the Southeast Asian region and India and in China and so forth are very very common sites for travel destination and obviously therefore it 's a high likelihood either they 've picked up bugs in the water to get sick and require hospitalization that they 're very likely to have acquired a pathogen particularly in the hotspots of Europe such as Greece and Spain particularly Greece is pretty much the septic tank of Europe now in terms of its hospital strains and with their economy declining these sort of things are only getting worse so in the past we would have just said well what about new antibiotics well I 'm afraid there 's not much to tell you about this is a No of drug companies in 1980 manufacturing and discovering new drugs this is 1998 this is 2010 and currently there are three so there has been a massive decline in the number of companies producing and investigating new drugs the answer is not in new drugs and in fact this graphic from w-h-o shows but potentially the discovery void since just before 1990 that there essentially been no new classes of drugs identified in the last 15 to 18 years so one of the reasons for this perhaps among many some of course are the finances of you know it 's less valuable to new anti lipid agent I 'm taking Crestor and I 'll take that once you know every night for the rest of my life that no one telling me to stop taking it because resistance will develop well that that anti lipid agent is more valuable to the company than developing an antibiotic that I might only take for three or four days so nevertheless there are other some interesting other reasons why 'd you just go discovery has declined and that is in the past traditionally antibiotics were collected and isolated from natural sources and primarily from soil specimens and that synthetic medicinal chemistry was used to then purify and improve those products whereas in about the 1990s those Rd the natural products would be emphasized and instead that was a reliance on bacterial genomes become genomics and so this led to a whole lot of new drugs being discovered but it was very very critical to each company that they had an appropriate library of new genomes if they 're going to discover new drugs and so although they could use high-throughput screening to identify that is basically they 're any new compounds being identified and and all pretty much all the companies has the same library so in fact although they discovered a number of novel targets by this approach none of these products really proceeded beyond Phase two clinical studies as they would have previously in terms of the natural product research so it 's subsequently led to this paper and others like this one by Helen Boucher and Boston summarizing the decline in new drug discovery ideas say coming out with programs like this bad bugs new drugs needed for new drugs and cha-cha to look at new models of funding for new drug development and this is just a graph from Helens paper showing that the fact that there 's hardly any new drugs so if you are Tom Hanks and you 're sitting in Apollo 13 you would be saying well houston we have a problem so in the past we 've traditionally thought about controlling antibiotic resistance in hospitals by limiting the emergence of new multi drug-resistant pathogens and and then as a secondary feature the infection troll issues about limiting transmission actually that this needs to be reversed the bush fire is running we yes we need new fire trucks yes we need you know new helicopters but there are 10 to 15 years away that 's how long it 'll take for the new drugs to be developed and what we need to do is cut a fire break to try and protect to limit the spread of what we the problems we have already in to protect us from any future worsening of this situation and that 's called infection control and for some of you you 've heard this my five points before but I 'll beat you up with it again and that is that there are five in my view five practical steps to controlling antimicrobial resistance array AMR without new drugs and we can look back to the past to actually give us some clues to this so if you say well what is the basics of controlling disease the main benefit brought to humankind was not antibiotics it was actually clean water sanitation housing all engineering solutions not involving doctors but only after was important and this was led by Florence Nightingale who obviously recognized the importance of spatial separation of infected patients and even a similar vice who identified the importance of hand hygiene and preventing cross transmission and then finally fifth out of this came along it was antibiotics that came along so that the pyramid would look something like this where the antibiotics are right on the very tip of the pyramid but on a basis of clean water sanitation and improved housing so my five practical steps are naturally as peters introduced as director of hand hygiene Australia I think hand hygiene seemed pretty important it helps reduce cross transmission whereas tightening antibiotic control helps reduce new emergence and because of the w-h-o programs some time back Australia joined this program it with various states having tried to initiate their own hand hygiene modules including mine in Victoria but eventually we joined the five moments program of hand hygiene and with this has really been a dramatic change in the number of so this graph just shows the number of hospitals across Australia so in this last audit period in hand hygiene Australia three times a year with the lighter coloured bars being private hospitals that the split for this now is about 95 percent of all public hospital beds are reporting to hand hygiene Australia and a bit over fifty percent of the private hospital beds we summarized the outcomes of the first two years a few years ago now we 're now up to five years and a new paper will be coming out shortly but with this we showed a significant decline in the rate of M RSA in the period after the introduction of the program but of course subsequently Peter and Brett Mitchell have recently published this paper in Clinical infectious disease showing it across Australia there 's been a steady decline in the rate of staph aureus bacteremia SABS both m RSA and methicillin susceptible staph aureus with the key declines being in the last few years and although hand hygiene cannot claim all the glory for this has been part of a package of different interventions I think it 's all awareness raising potential has been pretty critical so currently hand hygiene the and most successful national hand hygiene initiative anywhere in the world as I 've said already 782 sites mostly public but about half of that number in private we now have more than 6 million moments in the hand hygiene Australia database with electronic data submission the June results just announced yesterday are actually across the country eighty-one percent having started at about 19 percent five years ago medical staff remain an ongoing challenge but the latest order with just under seventy percent so when people say doctors are slow that 's true they 're about five years behind the nurses but at least they are improving and we 've seen major impacts in reducing national rates of healthcare associated staff or its bacteremia whether its raw numbers such as you know 2,600 staff back to rumia 's a few years ago to only 1,700 two years ago or the data that Peter and Brett have shown about declining rates so this is a photo from recently where Didier PJ from whi visit us and Chris Bagley acknow a chief medical officer and Malin Crookshanks and Phil Rosso has been many others where Australia was nominated as one of three sites of centre of excellence but by the w-h-o for hand hygiene but what 's more important than any of that is this document from my daughter 's year nine reading class where in Victoria English comprehension they actually had to read this document about the importance of hand hygiene and how to do to alcohol rub your hands as part of their English comprehension because once we get the average voter understanding importance of hand hygiene that 's when the politicians will listen as they are starting to do and that starts with with the young what about improved hospital cleaning is the second of my suggestions well here 's a graph from my hospital where despite all our hand hygiene and falling rates of staff we 've actually seen an increase in rates of VRE and this is because BRE rather than being related to the rather being related to hand hygiene is more related to cleaning and we know that in the past 40 years at least in Victoria there 's been a decline in the priority hospitals in Australia cleaners are one of the lowest paid and least educated our workforce at least in my hospital a few years ago ten percent of all that cleaners were illiterate in any language they were good people as just you couldn 't give them written information about very proud of their work but it was a different approach needed to educate them they had very non standardized cleaning practices in fact the record was nine cleaning products in one of the cleaners cupboards and he often used to put a squirt of our alcohol rub into the bucket as well because he heard that was good that there are plenty of poor motivation but environmental contamination with all these different bugs that were listed there is critical and we 've done various surveys showing that things like the way chair were universally contaminated with the re if you had a couple of the re colonized patients in the ward so we decided to treat the whole of the Austin as a cess pit and just assume that it was all completely contaminated and that if we knew that well why didn 't we just start to get rid of all the other products and only use the bleach based cleaning product and so that 's what we did you can see all the years of medical education specialist education going overseas to Harbin whatever at all down to the length of this hose and whether it fell below the edge of the bucket and stop causing splashing of the bleach and was mixing with cold water and so forth and but with this we got rid of all the other products and moved to a simple one single step we introduced cleaning supervisors so that they could actually check that the cleaning was done properly at this new miraculous approach and we modified we abandoned CDC dress codes in terms of long sleeve gowns and gloves and instead opted for a apron such as this and relying on alcohol based hand rub instead of the wearing of gloves and in fact the cost savings from getting rid of the gowns and gloves was so massive that we pay for the all the salaries of the seven new cleaning cost a lot of money but the yellow bag that they went into because they 've deemed as infectious waste it 's about 15 times more expensive to dispose of than a routine bag and so the savings were enormous and with that we saw a just over one-third reduction 37.4 percent reduction in the rate of new VRE colonization a stabilization of the overall burden of colonization which in our liver transplant unit is running at about one third of all the transplant recipients and a reduced inpatient acquisition rate but more importantly a seventy percent reduction in VRE bacteremia related to this we summarized this in this paper in the journal of hospital infection and we consider this universal approach to cleaning where you assume the hospital 's dirty in fact my professor of medicine in our department said you know Lindsay the hospital smells like hospitals used to 15 or 20 years ago you know bleach and I said yeah remember before we had superbugs oh yeah okay and so you know I think this is a neat approach and it also means that when you have got the same product so you 're just reinforcing the same standard national standards for invasive device insertion and maintenance well obviously we put in a lot of invasive devices such as these and peripheral IV lines are pretty important and summarized here by Rhonda Stuart and Paul Johnson showing that the rates of staff bacteremia gastronomically after 72 hours when Ivy 's been in place for 72 hours and so we decided to review our peripheral IV cannula policy and in fact I was interested to find out we actually had six policies the shortest of which was 27 pages at my hospital and that we had multiple different dressing trays we often using non sterile gloves rarely anyone use no touch technique even though one claims that you shouldn 't do this and that we found the Perseid for a hand hygiene peripheral IVs the number one cause of Austin associated that my Hospital associated staph aureus bacterium is and we were running about two a month and yet each one of those cost the hospital about twenty five thousand dollars more per case to manage so we new policy which only contained that information and that that material that we actually required through IV insertion and we decided that there should be a sticker in the notes whenever an IV was put in and there should be a sticker on the IV and if there 's no sticker on the IV the nurse just pulls it out it means it 's been put in incorrectly you can see the training video on this YouTube website and so we developed a new hospital standard on nurse standard where is actually mandatory for nursing staff to follow this otherwise they would get cited and this was that all IVs that are inserted by the ambulance were to be removed in the IDI or if they weren 't immediately on admission to the ward that all IVs must have an insertion sticker no sticker means removal by the nurse without asking the doctor doesn 't matter how hard the needle was to get in it 's removed all ideas are degree be removed at 72 hours no permissions required except in Pediatrics which were those obviously specific issues and then 's our rate of staff peripheral IV line staff bacteremia is per month the eighteen months prior to the intervention you can see they 're running at roughly two two three a month here 's the intervention period and this is the response subsequent to the intervention so if you calculated according to rate as input ten thousand five bed occupied bed days there 's a highly statistically significant reduction from point four seven four ten thousands of 0.09 the value of point zero zero three and this paper should be coming out in the next month or so of course if plenty of other as I mentioned sterile procedures that we should look at particularly urinary catheters you know when you consider that about one-third of all women who get a urine catheter associated with surgery get a urinary tract infection afterwards it 's unbelievable and most of this is related to poor insertion technique and the fact that Australia does not have a standard approach to inserting it whether it 's peripheral IV lines or urinary catheters is really ridiculous when we think you think of all the such a simple thing to look at improved hospital design well really this is pretty simple and brief because whether you 've got all comes down to the patient to toilet ratio and whether your bums like this or preferably like this it 's one bumper toilet and so this is a simple new manager for all architects of hospitals and that is one bumper toilet and the importance of not sharing toilets particularly for gram-negative or gut bacteria is critical if you 're going to want going to try and stop transmission and then finally of course is tightening antibiotic prescribing control and this is a whole topic in itself but we all know that there 's an overload of antibiotics being used that you know back in 2000 prior to Peter going to OHS that these drugs should not be used in food production because of the risk of cross development of resistance and cross transmission so this brings us to the term of one health and really the title of this talk and why food is the new frontier so why is that the case well obviously already a venture of Donald infections including the gall bladder URI infections particularly in women are because the urethra and the and the rectum are close by and the urethra is short and obviously in all the people in terms of aspiration pneumonia and gut flora is altered by the ingestion of food both the bacteria in obvious case picking up cell Mandel or something that 's going to make you sick but what about picking up the e.coli that don 't actually make you sick but then just sit in your gut until they cause problems later and of course there 's also not just the bacteria but actually the genes that they carry with them and we 'll come back to this in those jeans though you need to be located on the chromosome where they don 't tend to move much unless they 're on trust the transposon so they can be highly mobile such as in plasmas then of course there 's the antibiotic residue that may be present in native food as part of its production or finally of course the gut flora can be about it recently there 's been some studies looking at you know how much do we know about theses and if only about 8% of the genetic material in our feces is actually coming from bugs that we know what the species are the other 92% is coming from undiscovered organisms so far so there 's a lot to learn about poo now I 'm going to introduce this term about ear spells or extended spectrum beta lactam eise 's why well because this these sbls are a critical resistance component which denotes resistance to all the penicillins and in some cases kepler spawns and if they 're broad enough in fact even the carbapenem such as meropenem and similar to other resistance genes they can be either inherit inherent in the organisms such as the so called escaping organisms those species listed there or they can be acquired through plasmids they 're now very common they 're mostly on mobile genetic elements such as plasmids and they can switch susceptible gram-negative bacteria or gmds into ESBL containing multi resistant superbugs and so potentially they can affect all the gut so though they denote resistance to be lactams they are colocasia with resistance to aminoglycosides fluoroquinolones such as ciprofloxacin tetracycline the macro lives and in some cases such as the ndm back that I was talking about previously to meropenem so we that means it 's wiping out all drug classes except for Palestine and teacher cycling and teacher cycling is a very limited range and colistin will fry your kidneys in about seven to fourteen days so neither drugs are really ideal so the best analogy of this mobile resistance element you know how can how can it it 's not just that I 'm acquiring a whole lot of e.coli I only need to acquire two or three coli and then the genes from that indium of the e.coli jumped out of the bug and it infected my susceptible e.coli to make them superbugs so the best analogy is a washing machine and you have all these white t-shirts which you put in the washing machine then you add one ready to shirt and then at the end of it all your t-shirts are red t-shirts now the 's it 's gene or as pigment and turned all the others into red t-shirts and so that 's probably the best easy-to-understand analogy and this is my friend Ken Montgomery one of my patients and he best identifies the concern that I have about agricultural use of antibiotics so ken is a businessman who came in have his transrectal prostate biopsy those you don 't know what you do is you pass the tube up into the rectum you punch holes through the rectal wall into the prostate from which you take the biases to see if the patient has malignancy of the prostate so Ken had his routine procedure excellent urologist gave him the appropriate antibiotics prior to the procedure but 36 hours later he presented with multi-resistant gram-negative bacteria and almost died over the next 24 hours finally salvaged but then required six weeks of intravenous americanum to treat his multi-resistant gram-negative intravenously so he went from having a simple procedure the six weeks of having a pickle and about 200 a day of antibiotics and care now the only risk factor that this man had was back from spending three months in France and you can say what we normally think of Europe as a clinic you know that region is a clean part of the world but in fact if you look at their antibiotic use in that region and worse than others you 'll see that in food production this is a new growth industry and this is highlighted by yonk light smells fabulous paper here in our clinical infectious disease where he actually showed that the the e.coli that he found in retail chicken in his country had the same es bills in them as what they were identifying in humans who are getting the ESP or positive being coli illness in fact his conclusions were we felt we found significant genetic similarities among the SPL ecoli isolates from chicken meat and humans according to mobile resistant elements virulence genes and genomic backbone therefore chicken meat is a likely contributor to the recent emergence of SPL they coli in human infections in the study region now subsequently Andrew stewartson who 's currently working with me having just returned from Geneva working with Didier meat that was delivered to the kitchens of the University of Geneva Hospital and in fact found that 92% of all the raw chicken meat was contaminated with SPL positive gram negatives interestingly hardly any of the cooks who they cultured who are in the kitchens had this in their feces so what that shows is that actually hand-washing and all the very strict infection control procedures that are inherent in food production will protect you but this is an important public health message with which I bet most Australians of most French don 't think about when they 're cooking then their evening meal and then of course the Peter here in the audience along with a couple of other authors actually estimated the number additional deaths in your per year associated with this problem and estimated at around 1500 I don 't quite know your mouth Peter but it 'll do that anyway is obvious I think it 's probably more than 1500 but 67,000 excess length of day bed days so you can see this is a big deal what about other regions this fabulous paper from Chinese swine farms and this is particularly notable this is this sort of a heat map showing that the massive amount of antibiotics are now being used to produced we 're now producing pork and chicken and seafood on an industrial scale so that once you move from pasture-fed or routine food production such as we have in Australia to intensified farming practices the only way you can get economy of scale is to basically use antibiotics or very strict infection control procedures and in those sites because transmission of infection from one bunch of animals to another is just almost inherent and so this study looked at the massive use of antibiotics in China showing and in fact all the downstream effects so that the animals were fed antibiotics to in some cases make them grow faster but more often to stop them cross transmitting respiratory infections and so forth that their feces then was loaded with E coli and other gram negatives that were multi-resistant that feces was washed down onto the paddocks in some case those genes were incorporated into the grass and the other the other course when it rained that that manure was swept into the river ways in those organisms and those resistant genes sort of swept downstream where that the water was then drunk by towns further down the stream so it 's led to summary papers like this and you could say well this is just limited to antibiotics but no it gets worse so that now in Europe to try and extend the trucking range of fruit and veg to from some countries so that they don 't go off in transferring from one region to another there 's been a growth in the use of azole antifungals sprays particularly drugs that we would normally rely on to cure our chemotherapy and and transplantation patients such as Bora Connersville and this fabulous paper looked at the rising rates of resistance to for o 'connor all amongst Aspergillus species downwind from orchards where they are using these sprays to protect the orchards and so this is just a map of Netherlands where they looked at this and the in the it 's interesting though when you look at the the data in David Denning that the global crop market was worth 48 billion in 2011 is growing at about 5% of the year of all the pesticides sprayed on crops 40% of fungicides and more than 25% of those arrays off so we 're now using fluconazole via console and pozzolanas off well and it receives the waste water from approximately 90 pharmaceutical manufacturers which empties the water source from meters the Indians downstream so here 's the river downstream and there 's been studies done looking at the toxic effect of this such a tadpole RV now grow that the growth is inhibited at one to five hundred dilution of this river system that the milligrams per liter and many drugs such as cipro and and others are now incredibly high and some higher than the therapeutic serum concentrations and that there 's about forty four kilos of cipro in this river per day compared to the nine kilos of ciprofloxacin ooze per day in the whole of Sweden so downstream is about one gram of cipro per kilogram of river sediment and really if this was gold people would be it 's considered waste but this has an environmental impact so this is an interesting Ted this talk actually if you 're in interested in this topic by dr. Larson so really we 're like this I mean this is just dumb and getting dumber it makes you start to feel like this and then finally like this and then you turn to drink so what are the Australian issues and initiatives and you know there are there are some things we can do so first of all Australia has been a leader because of this largely because of this report the so called jeddak I report back in 1999 that John tarnish led and Peter obviously was on involved in those with many others which actually predicted what we 're going to face now back in 1999 the question was why didn 't anyone listen to it they 've been at subsequent publications directly looking at agricultural food use of antibiotics so in fact last year there was a Senate inquiry led by Richard D Natali who 's a member for the greens who actually is a GP is minute and that is amongst the pork producers they they 're actually a number of vaccines available which can avoid them using any antibiotics but they got tangled up in the mad cow disease ban on imported vaccines they had nothing to do with beef production or coming from BSE but any imported vaccines of animal use were were banned at a time when everyone 's worried about mad cow disease but in fact it was a bit illogical this so their argument you know we should be re looking at what vaccines we can bring into the country so if we come back to this document does Australia adhere to this no the answer is not they 're pretty good but we 're not totally adherent so if you look at a brief summary this is just my summary of you know chicken is there a lot of antibiotic use well actually it is pretty high pork yes it 's moderate but it 's decreasing and I 'll show you some data they 're very interested in reducing their use beef well there 's hardly any antibiotic use in the cattle get given antibiotics because they 're herded into feeding Lots where they get respiratory tract infections so I personally don 't eat grain fed beef it 's a fad it 's there 's no reason for it we have fabulous grass-fed beef and they 're never given any lamb simile is grass-fed no no antibiotics dairy well it depends until just recently the government has just changed the regulations on one of the macro lives which previously was being routinely added to the feed of dairy cows so this will be interesting to see whether there 's changes and when you think of the massive market that dairy now potentially has in countries like China it is important that we market our product as a clean green product rather than being contaminated and then of course there 's you know things like crops and seafood and I 've already mentioned that and then interestingly you know so actually this is the height of my publishing career where my this article was after I gave a talk at the dairy foundation I was actually quoted in the weekly times and so my kids see you know it was page 74 actually but it 's on the right-hand page not the left-hand page which is always good and then of course there 's this new whole initiative insect farming so actually the quickest most cheapest way to produce protein is to grow crickets and and and locusts and things like this because you know cubic space they produce more protein than anything else heaven knows what we 'll think about in terms of antibiotic use for them so what are the Australian studies well they 're largely focused up until now on diarrheal pathogens such as capital of a cure of salmonella or the looking at directly acquired pathogens rather than resistance genes and a key focus has always been in e.coli and I think that in some ways this information has been used to misrepresent the situation and I 'm Peter and I 'm you know I wanted to be joined in particular who constantly says there 's no information to show that there 's multi resistant genes out in the being produced or multi-resistant pathogen in Australia well and they 're not legislated to look and so forth so it 's not that there isn 't any it 's just that no one 's looking this is a paper I think Peter just recently your group looked at ecoli in poultry presented at ASM this year my concern with these sort of things as only looking at e.coli and this has been a traditional as it 's just been a traditional thing to do and so these are two of my med students Jaden McClelland and Josh pitcher and they teamed up with Mary Barton who is a vet from South Australia and this guy John Burke who is the president of the Victorian pork Association they 're very keen to rid themselves of using any antibiotics and when you go to his farm it is spotless it 's stainless steel the infection control there is better than at my hospital and the reason is because every week is producing 200,000 worth of pigs 200,000 a week and he cannot afford to lose one week 's supply so this means big business and that that the two guys raised and then went to the abattoir to see how they are slaughtered and similarly went to chicken farms and so forth and although I can 't present all the results of this because in fact it 's being presented in three weeks time at the big us infectious disease meeting but I can tell you is that these are the different supermarkets and so what they did was they went round and sampled 30 supermarkets and butchers shops are out in the catchment area of the Austin hospital and for a certain fee I 'll tell you which ones were positive and then they cultured on selective media to look for ESBL containing gram negatives not limiting it to e-coli looking at all different gram negatives and so these are this is just for Australian pork the good news is that there was very low rates of multi-drug resistent gram negatives in Australian pork now you may not realize but when we buy pork at the supermarket if it does not have a bone it is not Australian it 's all important it 'll either be from Canada or all-important not tested so what they did was they went out to those supermarkets have bought pork spareribs with the skin on because it 's the skin which is important and chicken drumsticks which has skin on it 's the same with chicken if you buy a chicken well chickens are bit different as often it 's been fileted but anything that 's got bone in it has to be Australian produce if it doesn 't have bones chili pork it 's almost always imported now all the Coles and Woolies stuff at the deli that 's all imported not tested so what these guys found was that actually there are very low rates of the ESB LS the high rates of the SPL is 97% of all chicken and pork they looked at had s bill containing bugs on the outside hardly any e.coli but how that was about it they were not resistant to all the other antibiotics which is what we 're seeing overseas and what was being reported them in the Netherlands and in Switzerland so these are the similar rates for chicken so what we looking at gram negatives other than just e.coli because those other gram negatives still contain those resistance genes on plasmids and adjust as infectious as the e.coli even though he call has been the traditional bug to look at that overall there are low rates as I 've said in chicken and Australian chicken and pork that ES bills were particularly common though and that some of them displayed any fallout resistance trimethoprim software was interesting the sites where we found that work in the industries where they use bactrim routinely to stop the piece from getting chest infections and that 's the very disease that could have been presented by each inducing one of these vaccines what 's the source of contamination well that 's unclear because we 're buying it from the supermarket in fact the commoners that strain was actually Acinetobacter and i think this is you know raises a question of actually where the outside of the meat is not getting contaminated back at the farm but rather at the deli where they 're chopping it up and packing it do you know so this there both food you know such as at the supermarkets but also if the average person knew that they need to wash their hands and clean the chopping boards and so forth to avoid this they would do that so a new approaches in needed in Australia we need to legislate to require foods to be tested for AMR pathogens as well as antibiotic residues so that we can test both local and imports I think we 'll find the imports are worse we need to reassess the importation of some vaccines and they provide a greater focus on infection trolling farms just as we have in hospitals we need to include IMR and antibiotic use on all farming and food production agendas a one health approach and probably we need to possess reposition Australian food as high-quality and safe with a greater quality focus on quality versus instead of price and quantity where we 're evaluating so the leaders in this so far have actually been the Australian pork industry but we need to get groups like the National Farmers Federation and others who seem to be fixated with low conclusion what we can say is antibiotic resistance is no longer simply a health issue it 's now a social issue it 's an environmental issue and pretty soon it 's going to be a major economic issue current situation regarding new antimicrobial developments a major problem but it 's going to take more than a decade to fix and in the meantime we need to introduce a firebreak and I 've mentioned five suggestions of how we could do that but finally we need new Australian initiatives are one really genuine one health approach with new legislation requiring setting up a system of surveillance for AMR and a new priority in terms of avoiding inappropriate antibiotic use in the food production but what we need most of all is action and if we don 't do this we 're probably going to be left like this with this is our last resort for killing boats so at that point I 'll stop and thank you for your attention I know it 's good question so I don 't think we 're talking about an extremely sterile environment I mean went out at night dirt like every other kid and I think you know we can be overly obsessed with it and I guess it 's an example you know this obsession in the supermarkets of having else alcohol-based hand rub now for sale in supermarkets and every mum having it on there I mean it 's probably not necessary it 's more important in places like hospitals where we 're putting all the patients together so I I agree with is sort of tenant of your argument that you can go too far look we 're not even close to that you know I mean when you see photographs of porn fisherman or a salmon fisherman pouring buckets of ciprofloxacin into giant pools where they 're breeding the fish you know this is this is a different matter I think well actually there have been though that 's sort of argument the problem is a lot of the crops now are being sprayed with similar chemicals and antibiotics I mean bacteria don 't just just have that involved in protein production so it 's also in other productions so actually the rates of some of these bugs are about the same if you 're vegetarian or not what is interesting is the rates of contamination of food products is actually higher from organic farms than non-organic farms because you 're actually pouring manure using manure as the primary fertilizer source so it depends what that animal was fed before you use there than us so it 's not quite as simple as being a mediator no look thanks for that look but no means that I suggest that I mean super entitled to antibiotics if they 're sick the same as humans so I think that what we 're not arguing what I 'm not arguing is that they 'll issue withdraw that sort of therapeutic use for animals that 's absolutely mandatory and indeed the whole production cycle requires it I think though we need a tightening of the use of antibiotics in animals and that the therapeutic use for animal production is such a tiny proportion of the amount of antibiotic the tonnage that 's used currently I mean I actually envisage a day when in this similar to doctors you know we can we 've been doing this some personality profiling on medical stuff and you know doctors are highly individualistic they 're used to working on their own and problem solving on their own they dislike you know Authority and then told what to do and they 'll always listen to their neighbor or their their colleague more than they will a thousand randomized trials well this sounds like a farmer right and so actually there 's you know and they sort of usually solve the issue themselves and have strong opinions and tell everyone else what to do so you know I I can see actually a growing alliance at least Australian agriculture between the farming sector in the green sector you know they will become more environmentalists than the strongest environmentalist really because their future and their livelihood depends on it and there is no future in misusing antibiotics because that makes Australian agriculture just the same as the whole of Asia and we will never be more successful in Southeast Asia because of the production so therapeutic use of antibiotics through animal to what 's happening with humans and that is my prescription and by the apartment the qualified personnel yes I think the ideas been proposed before not just for agriculture but the human use too so you know I don 't know if you realize but well at least in my hospital now keffe tracks on his 70 cents a day and benzo penicillin is 15 so when we recommend using penicillin G instead of kept track st. per day it 's costing the boss you know kept tracks and is now so ridiculously cheap that it 's encouraging misuse if you are only going on economics you would just use kept tracks owned and meropenem there 's meropenem is now 7 a day instead of 75 like it used to be so all the generics which are being produced from India are now so cheap that one could legitimately argue that actually a tax should be applied on them to discourage inappropriate use and with that money and the same would apply with the the antibiotics that are commonly used in agriculture I think a key thing is removing automatically adding at least for this recent s for switched for one of the macrolides you know when the vets actually looked at the concentration is being added to theater is about one-tenth of the therapeutic concentration needed to treat an animal if you are using that macrolide for therapeutic purposes so it 's the perfect way to encourage the mergence of resistance and so you know there 's some structural legislative things that we could do but I think your idea of somehow readjusting things whether it 's attacks or not is _"

to country they also acknowledge the traditional custodians the Ngunnawal people and pay my respects to elder 's past and present and acknowledge other Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who are with us today to my ministerial colleague Shane Ratan Barry other members of the Legislative Assembly deputy chief of mission for the US Embassy Tom Doherty and the Mills family thank you very much for being here ladies and gentlemen distinguished guests boys and girls like to thank you all for taking time to be here to mark a really exciting occasion for our city and whilst it is an exciting occasion for Canberra it is tinged somewhat by significant international tragedy that occurred overnight that did impact upon Australians like to take this moment to express the ICT government 's sympathy to families and friends who were affected by the Malaysian Airlines incident can I though say it is a deed athlete and an exceptional ambassador for the city of Canberra I 'd also like to welcome back to Canberra aron baynes paddy spurs and boomers teammate and a fellow Australian Institute of Sport graduate I 'm also particularly like to thank the San Antonio Spurs for allowing the Larry O 'Brien trophy to leave the United States for the first time to be here today with our Australian stars it goes without saying ladies and gentlemen that Patrick Mills played an enormous part in securing that trophy for the Spurs in their NBA Finals victory against the Miami Heat and during the championship winning Game five paddy scored an impressive 17 points during his 18 minutes of court time including what everyone regards as the game-changing 14 points in that third quarter it 's certainly clear that he 's a crowd favorite in the US and most particularly here in Canberra and in places as far afield as his traditional home Thursday Island but ladies and gentlemen Canberra is very proud to call Patty Mills our own it 's fair to say that has come a long way since his and there 's a ball boy for the Canberra cannons both Patty and Aaron spent many hours on the courts here in Canberra at the Australian Institute of Sport and also attended Lake Ginninderra College recently it seems ladies and gentlemen it has been an Cambra athlete has made their mark internationally Nicky Rios recently at Wimbledon Carroll and Buchanan Michael Matthews Melissa Breen and of course our own Patty Mills patty is not just a gifted athlete though he 's also has a real sense of community he 's worked with a range of charities to help those less fortunate he 's got his painting increasing attention and this says a lot about his character his generosity and his compassion he 's an inspiring role model for any kid in this city in this country or anywhere around the world who is prepared to work hard to be the best that they can on behalf of the people of Canberra we 're delighted to welcome him back to the city he calls home and it 's with great pleasure that I now present the keys to the city of for a sec patty just welcome home patty it is it is great to see you here we 're so proud of you and to get to the keys to the city I mean what does it mean to you it 's a complicated question I think but look first of all I want to acknowledge the traditional custodians of this land the Ngunnawal people Arne Agnes Shea senior elder acting chief minister the minister of sport I 'd also like to acknowledge my teammate Aron Baynes for being here and also Tom Doherty the chief of mission from the US Embassy well first of all thank you everyone for coming out today this is an unbelievable turnout I can 't believe the Sun is out I 'll make this quick otherwise Aron Baynes when I get burnt over here but listen guys finally to answer your question this this is great I mean this is the kind of support that I didn 't realize at the time that was going on over in America in Texas especially and I 'm really thankful for the turnout and for the support all been giving us throughout the season especially the playoffs and then thank you very much again for the turnout today we 're going to talk about basketball and what it obviously means to you in terms of basketball but that 's going to come in a very short time but it just wanted to ask you how proud of you are you to do it with your mom and dad here and all of your family here it is great for you to to come back and I guess acknowledged the role that they 've played in in your basketball career as well yeah of course mom both mom and dad were here played a huge part ever since we started here and everyone else knows that here in Canberra and I think that they even more famous than I am in Canberra especially my dad with his Facebook updates but hopefully keeps everyone up to date which is great but obviously they 've been a big part I mean I 'm an only child so they have no one else to worry about but I 'm obviously for the NBA and the NBA Finals and obviously to be there in Game five along with my uncle Danny Morse who that was a very special moment for me too to get them to experience it because it was such a great achievement and an accomplishment that it 's going to be hard for me to stand up here and explain to you in detail what what it actually feels like so I 'm glad they got to witness that at paddy before you let you go for this part of it what do you hope that your role and and your achievements play for young Torres Strait Islanders how do you hope that this inspires them yeah look I think the fact that I play basketball and and I 've worked hard to achieve it now playing in the NBA and obviously for the for the stream boomers at that elite level now I 'm just using it to be honest to to promote my culture promote my heritage represent Australia represent Canberra and all the people that that have have the same dream that I have at the just as much as Aron Baynes has to be a role model for all Australian kids especially young indigenous kids so they can see me up here today I don 't know there 's a few out there today so you can see it 's just this is just me I 'm just a little indigenous boy from Canberra and that 's all it takes it 's nothing special just hard work dedication a couple of sacrifices and the passion and desire to one achieve greatness and that 's all it is hopefully I can pass that on to the young ones and then give them motivation to have the same dream good on you Patti we 'll get you back shortly to talk further about basketball thank you and well done thank you I 'd like now to invite Tom Cote from the u.s. embassy the deputy chief of mission just to talk about the impact that the Patty and the San Antonio Spurs have had on American basketball thank you um I was promoted at the very beginning here today as the ambassador originally our ambassador is in here very very much wanted to be here he does a lot of tweeting on on political events all of the time but when the San Antonio Spurs won the NBA there sherry sent out a tweet particularly because at en Aaron and I think it 's telling it was the most repeated and watched tweet that he sent out with although the political things and it 's just a sign that when Patty 's talking about being a role model here and identifying with folks in in in camera I 'd like to say as an American he and Erin are terrific role models for kids in America as well and that we 're very very proud of him we 're gonna take credit for them as well and I think it 's fitting you know it 's a nice winter day here but it is a winter day and probably worth remembering that basketball was invented in the United States I think in 1891 and it was invented in the winter by a sports director at a YMCA in Springfield Massachusetts and he did it in order to winters in New England and within two years it had spread to Europe to Asia to the Middle East and then later to Africa and I think it 's kind of a symbol of how sports can bring people together and if we needed another symbol we couldn 't have asked for a better one than then what we have here today with the trophy that 's come back I 've come to Canberra for the very first time we 're real proud of it we 're real proud to be associated we 're real proud that they 're graduates of American universities where they played that as well and for me pleasure to be here congratulations to them both nice to see the trophy here we look forward to making sure though that it ends up back in the United States along with both Patti and Aronson thank you very much never again did Patti in there just up here to just ask a few questions about basketball and obviously the trip around the world with the Larry O 'Brien trophy Patti you on the recovery phase by the there was in me throughout the whole season it was out of pain in my shoulder and it just kept getting worse and worse I I knew that was something bad I didn 't realize how bad it was had an MRI after the season and found out that I have a torn rotator cuff that completely came off the bone which meant I had to have surgery two weeks ago it 's looking like a six to seven month recovery so I missed the start of the next season this is why I 'm wearing this big pillow and and sling at the moment yes and Betty you and I we 've spoken a lot over the years I think you have Maris College when we first came across each other but you 're an outstanding track and field athlete you ever wonder what might have been yeah well obviously you know Kathy friend being a role model of mine and watching her you know handle the way she does on and off the track you know that 's who I want it to be so I do have quick enough so I decided to pick up the ball instead and give that a go and how great is it to be travelling around Australia with Aaron yeah this is great I mean you know he had such a huge part in the team you know this is a team that really came together which is rare you know we 're in the NBA we really enjoyed each other 's company and and Bains his craziness you know was a part of that whole thing and bringing everyone together so you know the boys are starting to get a little Australian accent and the Australian jokes thanks to Ben Z but but this is very special for both of us to have the chance to bring the trophy here and for everyone that put on this event thank you very much because this is I 'm gonna be by far you know on behalf of the rest of the country showing the trophy to you guys yeah all right Erin former AIS graduate obviously you 're going to get a rock star reception when you hit Cannes I would I won 't be counting on this many people coming out you know it 's a smaller city that 's why how proud are you though to be representing Australia in the NBA with Patti what a team it is the San Antonio Spurs oh yeah definitely I 'm you know it was an honor to be able to carry that flag high after we won up there on the podium when we were getting handed alario so yeah just any anytime I get to represent Australia you know that 's why I love putting on the green and gold every every summer and going out there and playing with these bunch of guys and it was made even sweeter that Patty and I first played together when then I was 17 and here 's 15 just down the road here at the Institute and we got to hold this thing together as well so it 's pretty special okay and what about you obviously you 're hoping that yet career continues for the Spurs you know that that 's the business side of things now that 's why I I 'll let them do that and I 'll just focus on getting ready for the world champs and representing Australia again shoot I was petty outs done petty you just signed a new three-year deal well done relief yeah very excited to say guys I 'm heading back to San Antonio for another three years it 's a great place and beenzino 's it 's a great family vibe a great environment and the stage that I 'm at in my career just just as well as bein zzs we 're trying to learn we 're trying to develop we 're trying to get our our games to new levels that we don 't even know that we can reach and the only way to do that is to be behind Tony Parker and Tim Duncan so it 's not a bad place to be alright ladies and gentlemen big round of applause for our own vines and Patty Mills now given Paddy 's got his arm in a sling there 'll be no autographs but they will be over there for photographs alright so the walk over there we 'll have to do it pretty quickly but once again what a great honor this is for Canada it is great to see Patti Knowles back in the SAT and representing Canberra so proudly on the world stage with the San Antonio Spurs and once again thank you everybody for coming here today thank you thanks guys _"

government advisor on asylum seeker and refugee mental health and contributed to the development of policy for mental health screening and response to torture survivors she has been involved in research and the impact of immigration detention on child asylum seekers I 'd like to welcome Louise for the keynote address thank you very much it 's really such a pleasure to see everything at this stage and I remember very clearly having discussions several years ago now with Kate Jones when she said look I 've got an idea and we were sitting down just over a cup of coffee and she had captured something that was so crucial within our work the need to have a vision about healing and recovery for children who 'd experienced such traumatic events and things went on from there and here we are so congratulations to everyone who 's been involved and it obviously takes a huge amount of work to get from I think what we have here is truly a very innovative approach a vision that says that we need to do something therapeutic for the most vulnerable children for those most in need for those where we know that they 've suffered trauma and disruption to the extent that unless we do something it 's likely to have very long term consequences for functioning but particularly for relations and connecting connectedness to others and social inclusion so there are many many reasons and who the evidence is actually very clear about why we should be doing exactly what case and others have been working on so it 's a therapeutic approach that very importantly says trauma and attachment models do have something to offer when we translate them into the sort of practices and services that we hope to have at a center like this where there can be a focus on rebuilding children 's sense of belief in others children 's sense of trust in others and the capacity to have relationships that are meaningful that are reciprocal and that are safe so calling this a place rather than is that very very symbolic and very very important this needs to be a safe place for children to come to a place where they can see have a sense that this is actually a secure base if we 're thinking in the terms of attachment theory so I think the symbolism the name a plant that 's well known for its role in healing and recovery are very important so from my perspective essentially this is an approach based on an understanding of the rights of children the children have a right to care and protection adults communities societies and cultures have a role in providing that children have a right to safe relationships and if they have been harmed they have a right to therapeutic input and they have a right to recovery so the rights of children I think is something that underpin there are all these sorts of activities and the building of a model like this but and I think I can 't resist the opportunity to say a few words about the real need in the current political climate to maintain a focus on proceedings today we 'll hear about many different groups of children their needs their vulnerabilities whether that 's from indigenous populations to multicultural groups and in the work that I 'm involved in children and infants who are seeking asylum and safety in this country but are not provided that at all so I think bearing that in mind as we go forward in developing approaches to working with children is going to be very important snap not at me nor kick it through okay can you on to the next one thanks so the click is not not functional okay so we 're all familiar with a very broad notions of what actually constitutes child abuse and neglect now we tend to think clearly in within a bit difficult framework but we also need to be mindful of the broader aspects where societies and communities in overall can fail to protect children or can set up policies and practices that actually damaged children in some way the UN convention on the rights of the children if we 're thinking within a rights framework clearly underpins this this project but only for care and protection but for participation and the voice of children I think is something that some often very difficult or fairly under played when we have these discussions so it 's very pleasing to see and in this project that children will be very much seen as having a role and a voice in the sorts of interventions and approaches that they might be involved in and I think what 's fundamental to thee to the UN Convention is that rights are universal they don 't apply to some children and not to others they actually apply to all children wherever they might be whatever their visa status now a lot of my workers with children of this age the very young and of course when we 're thinking about the very young we speak for them they are essentially am in need of someone to think about them to bear them in mind to actually talk about their needs and interests on their behalf as best best as we can at the moment in the parent infant mental health unit that I run at Monash I 's seven months of age who have come from Christmas Island to Darwin where this mother delivered to find themselves in detention in Melbourne and a mother who finds herself terrified and despairing that who Bay will be sent to Nauru or potentially worse to Manus Island she 's one of a group of mothers who are currently in deep states of despair as you may have heard about in the middle of this really complex to base I think maybe what 's being forgotten are the rights of children to care and protection so this little baby of the mother I care for it has what we would call failure to thrive he 's not growing he finds it difficult to eat he 's very small for those of you who understand baby 's issues he 's under six kilos and his seven months of age he has he 's a very thin sad despairing baby with a despairing mother when we look at situations like this I think it 's very important that someone thinks about child development the rights of the child the need to protect children can get very much lost which is what we 're seeing at the moment particularly again for the very young we 're also as people have alluded to talking about longer-term consequences that of the implications of early developmental trauma on children 's neurological development their brain development the development of their emotional capacities and importantly the development of their capacities to relate so when we think about some of the most vulnerable children I think it 's some it 's very sobering when we think about not only the current distress and trauma that we might need to respond to but the implications of this for social functioning for society as a whole particularly in an era when we are concerned about adolescent mental health and we know that many of those adolescents with mental health problems have come from very traumatic backgrounds so even more concerning when we look at government approaches and policies that literally replicate some of the very traumatic experiences that the rest of us spend our time trying to treat and to prevent so these are think very important debates at the moment the suffer a huge variety of traumas with these long term implications but particularly important going to be the impact on attachment relationships connectedness with others there 's a lot of discussion in this field of course about the importance of attachment attachment our attachment to our carers to our extended family networks to community to culture a fundamental to human functioning they provide a set of meanings scaffolding for interpersonal interactions and shared values and the capacity we hope to transmit those shared values to the next generation I think and we 'll hear more about this today obviously with the impact on groups such as indigenous communities with disruption of attachment and a hugely significant we 've seen the long-term implications of that as we look at the translation of disrupted attachments in caregiving context into disrupted social functioning and the real need to actually intervene in that and prevent that rather than cast moral aspersions on particular people I think the same applies when we look at the asylum seekers the motivation of these people to offer their child a future a better life is a worthy motivation very difficult to intervene in this and to actually have a more broader and sophisticated discussion is that these are somehow bad people wanting to exploit others with only self interest at heart I think that 's very disappointing that we in Australia have sunk to such a level that we can 't even have a more sophisticated discussion of some of the core values that motivate anyone to protect their children I would like to think that all of us have we found ourselves in situations where we were persecuted discriminated against or children had no future we would all become asylum seekers I would hope and take our children so we have I think academically a great interest and the field of so-called developmental traumatology and which tries to understand the impact of trauma on development and the way trauma expresses itself it is of different age groups has been a marvelous academic exercise we do know a lot more about the long-term implications of trauma and how we maybe can intervene we have evidence-based models which can help us shape therapeutic approaches what 's very important though we can actually do this sort of work where we can look at the evaluation of tailor-made interventions for different different population groups for different communities that are based on an understanding of the way in which trauma is experienced and expressed and different ways of intervening so we can 't assume that all different all traumatized groups in the community will respond to the same approach so the dialogue with communities themselves around what constitutes trauma what does recovery mean I think is very important at my unit we 're doing some of that work with young refugees who have been extremely traumatized but talking to them and in terms of their own cultural set of meanings and understandings about what does recovery mean what 's going to be helpful what sort of services do we need what would you actually come to if we had something and I think what 's most noticeable is that many of these groups do not easily go to the mainstream public hospital sector for support or treatment and it 's one young Sudanese boys said to me why would I go to the place you go when you 're really going to die when there is no alternative he said why don 't you come to me why don 't you come to where we hang out his young his group of young people and I think that 's a simple example but really very very important that we need to avoid imposing our particular frameworks and understandings of trauma and recovery on diverse populations that we work much more embedding ourselves within those population groups and thinking about what we what we can do the evidence about the impact of early adversity in the broad sense on development and its relationship to mental health outcomes is actually quite clear by making this point I know I 'm speaking to the converted but I think it 's an important point to highlight in terms of some of the debates that go on currently a lot of these debates of course are about how can we get more resources and funding for our particular part of the service how can we build up from in my perspective how can I get more money with mental health problems until later someone who works with young people or adolescents might argue well I should have more of the funding because that 's when the young people present to services so we get in these very limited and rather polarized discussions what we do know is that all mental health problems whether they present in adolescence or young adulthood have underlying vulnerability and risk factors and that trauma abuse and neglect is probably the most significant group of factors that we know about in terms of large-scale epidemiological studies those are the factors that contribute to the whole range of mental health problems down the track not just one mental health problem not just something that we might call post-traumatic stress disorder also called borderline personality disorder which some people be familiar with sometimes not helpful labels but the entire range of mental health problems in other words there 's increasing evidence that trauma abuse maltreatment early on set up neuro vulnerability to the entire range of mental health problems now we don 't know enough about why one person develops a particular disorder another person that but what 's significant is what we do know trauma and abuse contribute in a major way to neuro vulnerability and to the burden of mental health problems in adolescence and young adulthood what that says to me and I 'm totally biased obviously what it says to me is that we should be doing much more about early identification asian an early intervention of these high risk families and children who are already exposed at a very young age to trauma and abuse we know enough about the science of brain development to say that those experiences in and of themselves contribute to setting up a vulnerable brain a brain that 's much more likely to develop mental health problems in response to later trauma and stress what we know from a social and cultural perspective is that trauma and stress is cumulative that people who are vulnerable maeve ulnar belen their early years by adversity attachment disruption abuse neglect and so on a more likely to have stressful experiences down the life they sent down the lifespan sensitized to poor relational functioning to re exploitation and revitalization have very marked responses in terms of stress response so doing something about early vulnerability really speaks to me about primary prevention as far as we can do that but certainly we need greater expertise and service responses in how to actually intervene for these children who are a great vulnerability of contributing to our overall community burden of mental health some of the examples I guess are fairly well known and the Romanian and Bulgarian orphans such as these children in unbelievably poor institutional care where many of course were also abused in a direct sense as well as being neglected underfed and having little in the way of human interaction these terrible examples have of course allowed us to understand much more about the developmental pathways the impacts of these sorts of experiences and Kate Jones to get back to Kate and I 've had many discussions some over the years about some of these children who we see in out-of-home care and under the various programs who continue to have even though they 've been in places of safety for many years ongoing difficulties with attachment and young people from these sorts of backgrounds neurologically and functionally remain oriented around survival makes perfect sense if you 've lived in an environment like this they 're operating in a basic and call level around surviving in case something terrible happens again and not being able to re-establish the sense of safety so for all the children that we 're talking about today re-establishing a sense of safety and a belief and a hope for the future that things might be all right is going to be pretty fundamental but very difficult for some children with these experiences we know that this is a CT scan brain of a child in one of these from this background a Bulgarian institutional care and a normal three-year-old brain essentially the child who 's been neglected and deprived in such an extreme way is showing in there the way their brain is actually structured equivalent degeneration and loss of brain tissue that we might see in someone who has a degenerative dementia in their later years fortunately we do know a lot more about the capacity of the young brain to regenerate these experiences but this is I think a very important point that a lot of us spent time talking about the needs of children in an emotional and psychological way we 're also talking about in the early years the way the child 's brain develops and is shaped or in this situation damaged by the social and emotional environment that they find themselves in the children in detention is probably I think and extremely it 's an emotional issue but an issue which I personally think that none of us who work with children or in child protection settings can be neutral on I find it very puzzling when people say to me I don 't have a view on children in detention I 'm not prepared to speak out or to have a stated belief about this because it 's so political child protection the needs of children the rights to protect children have always been political I think it 's absolutely naive to assume that has ever been anything different we 're very clear that we advocate for the rights of children in the mainstream community we groups we 're used to that and I 'm really I think it 's very concerning that this group of children is seen as somehow different as if rights apply to others but not to these children this is a drawing from a child on Manus Island when children were there these children experience themselves literally as imprisoned as trapped and this girl you can 't read her writing there but she talks about the dots being she keeps of calendar of every day that she 's in detention this is an eight-year-old child the issues for infants of course over the years have been raised and are being raised today as we speak and as you may be aware they 've been in the last two days ten mother 's on Christmas Island have been engaging in self-harm and suicidal behaviors of varying of varying types what 's significant about that is that it is about their babies that women are of the belief that if they even if one successfully suiciders then maybe the babies would be given a better better options and I think this speaks to us involved in children about the necessity of keeping children and places like Christmas Island the necessity of threatening these young women and their babies with transfer to somewhere like Naru where the having been there the circumstances of detention and the capacity to meet the needs of vulnerable children are incredibly limited so the asylum seeker children also include of course children without families children are the unaccompanied minors many of whom are now of course in our community and is still around fifty percent of young people arriving unaccompanied children within these environments have been exposed to the sorts of traumas that when we speak about trauma in general we 're very concerned about but these are even greater magnitude children are witnessing the behavioral disturbances that have gone on in these environments over the last decade children are not able to be protected in terms of what they 're exposed to children with families witness the mental breakdown of their parents such as these young children on Christmas Island at the moment many of the parents are depressed despairing failed to protect our children because of their these sorts of situations and these were drawings that we collected from the initial round of detention in Baxter and warmer our children exposed to riots to extreme riot responses and I think we 're probably all familiar with these these sorts of descriptions of what actually went on in detention but the question I think we need to ask as a group of people involved in responding to children at need is why on earth we 're doing it again and I think this is one of the most difficult difficult questions when the evidence in terms of the research and unsurprising results the children are damaged in these environments I think that 's fairly clear the Department of and the minister is unlikely to challenge that directly but I think what makes the current situation even more morally perilous if you like is that that 's the conditions of detention which caused in a major way the problems that we 've seen and the developmental and poor psychological outcomes for children are in fact being replicated despite the fact that we have in my in-migration law statements to a matter of last resort for extremely brief periods of time for necessary processing I don 't think that 's unreasonable but at the moment we are detaining children and babies as a matter of first resort and as you 're aware not offering care and protection for unauthorized so-called unauthorised arrival so these are in many ways are the crises that come up when we work with child protection and children at knee in need and many of us in our different work contexts are experienced in advocacy and in making statements and trying to broaden the discussion in actually trying to have a more comprehensive approach and essentially a more humane approach to the most vulnerable so I think we can all contribute to this discussion but particularly important that we don 't remain neutral so we 've called this the groups that I 'm involved with quite using quite strong language but I 'm not going to shy away from the strong language that the great irony of a marvelous project like this and what we all have to struggle with is the fact that whilst we to developing a therapeutic framework for children we have some in our political leadership who are literally supporting the abuse of children and arguing that this is necessary in some way for the greater good I think that 's the argument we need to challenge from a human rights perspective and from a child protection perspective that no state should be abusing children in this way that states and communities have a responsibility a key responsibility to protect children that all of us as members of the community have a right and should be opposing state-sanctioned abuse of children or any policy or practice that is damaging children and that we have a view on this so I would urge you if you feel strongly enough about this issue to actually contribute to that discussion on the basis of the work and support that you already have for child protection a unit such as this a place of safety like this project will in fact see some asylum seeker and refugee children no doubt and we 'll have I hope an ongoing and significant role in protecting those children in very much _"

    "text": "good morning Australia I 'm honored to be here on the land of the Ngunnawal and I want to recognize the Welcome I received from the Nano elder Richard Bell he said something to us today that I think we need to reflect on he said that if we do not honor the names that our fathers have given us that we will stand in accountability for what we hand down to our children so our forefathers have given us this name Australia and at this moment I feel disassociated I feel in despair that our forefathers and I think how some of our forefathers would be thinking of this what is happening at this time in this place is something that the rest of the world will be looking at however what I want to say to you is that for so long this country has denied the voices of Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islander people to be heard the voices of our children so I think we need to reconsider who we are as a nation and I would like to now say that if somebody now to lick it like that I would like to set up such trauma centers in every part of Australia what we 're here to commemorate today before cook came to this place we now called Australia my eldest told me back in bundling country there was no Southern Cross in the sky and I thought what do you mean by that there 's no sight than cross in the sky and they said well no it was unity and the later as we talked I said well it was actually gonna be organ Abee it was the Black Swan fly across the southern skies to make food for the bunch line families and in that they made a depiction between a separation between the spiritual essence of the star system we now call the Southern Cross and the physical manifestation of the bird we call the Black Swan that provided food for us so I think there 's two things we need to think about we need to look deeply into our soul who are we who are your ancestors there is not a person in this room here now some level I welcome your ire I recognize your presence here in this room now invader I have an ancestor it came out on a prison hulk they invaded this country with our permission they came and immigrant and the bulk of the people who would call themselves refugees asylum seekers immigrants came to this country as economic refugees moving away from war zones moving away from great poverty and despair and so I think it 's time that we started to think about ourselves as the eyes moving to the we how do we start to function in this country where we honor and respect or people in all ways and it 's about listening memory Sangam are said on the 26th of January 1988 in Tasmania that the greatest gift we as Aboriginal people can give this country is our ability to listen to each other to know each other more deeply to understand our stories and listening is one of the hardest things we can do particularly when we don 't want to hear so in pitting giro country and this is part of my master 's they didn 't have to be experts over the other they just had to hold the stories but in pidgin chitara country when a little 14 year old girl suicided she being bashed stabbed raped and she was pregnant nobody wanted to hear what was under that need to end that life of that little girl and if we had listened at that time and if we had responded well then the little nine year old three years later would not have hung herself so it 's time that we learned to talk listen and then with good heart move I 've just done the wrong thing here so I 'm going to talk to you about some children in school a special school a school were all the bad children and sent ha three and two and a half years ago I 'm one of my good friends rang me and said I 've just been asked to apply for this job in this special school they 've got all these special schools in New South Wales set up to send the kids who 've been expelled from all said on my veranda and we decided that we would think first of all about how we hold the children in that school it 's an Aboriginal way of behaving of working together with our children so we would introduce this term called educating this concept of how we move education into what it originally meant from the Greek to rear up to new to the children to draw out from them to lead to show the way then we would pay attention to their parents their carers some of them are in foster care and the community and we would open that educational centre to healing workshops and for the community to come if they so wanted then we would pay attention to the needs of the teachers how were they what were they able to do in this field in fact they were failing miserably and we needed to embed everything we did in research this is what we did we got the formal invitation we see I suggested to her that we introduced in your way of thinking and now that new way of thinking that we community and do we ran a half-day workshop and in that half-day workshop we were told that truck is move into that town and pick up young girls for sex we 'd only been there for three weeks and we heard this story and we thought well we 've got a job to do we ran a full-day workshop for the teachers and within a very short time those teachers chained the who turned themselves around and then I 'm coming to the third year now working with this school we never got any support I funded this project myself I put money into my car drive out there put money into my graduate students going out there and doing this work as of next Monday the government is funding some of our work so hallelujah what we found is that the teachers were experiencing burnout that carries torment or lack of theory to children 's behavior and they had no skills to respond we found the carers the parents the community the parents were demonstrating clear complex trauma symptoms and the community itself had symptom as history this is Rides and yet in that community in that place there is great racism great sexism great classism operating today now we found historical social cultural trauma symptoms we found little communication between the various sectors responsible for children 's well-being and there was a critical need to upskill the workforce at every level what we found we found children that were hurting they weren 't bad they weren 't mad they clearly had in the language of our experts developmental trauma symptoms and I 'll go back to this diagnosis we got this diagnosis because this little fella went crazy in the the administration part of the school and they had to call in the police and isn 't it he wasn 't on a charge so we wanted a diagnosis so that we could actually use that to help him and get the authorities to think different differently this little fellow of 11 had emerging psychosis with mood to present content they did the diagnosis by the way by Skype so you know do you know that in New South Wales we import three psychiatrists every three months from got some paranoia he thinks the world is unsafe well this little fella saw his mother killed at 3 and his only kill by a truck in domestic violence and he saw his ad killed at 9 by a truck running over her yes his world is unsafe suicide ideation he tried suicide twice and the medical report said that he was just attention-seeking we have as a population percentage basis the highest suicide rates in the world and we still are not getting it right I have worked extensively on suicide across Australia in Aboriginal in Australia and that 's the only place I work apart from p.m. GMT more on trauma issues and in every case every person who had suicided or attempted suicide had major trauma stories let 's deal with that it 's not out there like that it 's here in the stories that were holding he had chronic grief and he had never received any grief counselling and he had complex post-traumatic stress disorder on the other side the observable behaviour of the kids with our highly sexualized sexualized language sudden uncontrollable rages in at one level and then flip and to go into a controlling behaviour boom so you had the the rage then the subservient and then highly controlling and there was a total emotional literacy and quite a few of them had a ves fetal alcohol spectrum which we 're not even talking about in one part of Australia at the moment we have forty five percent of the original children babies who are born today have fetal alcohol spectrum there are no services out there on that yet where are you experts are so far behind what we need and what you need to be engaging with us on and talking about us with us so I 'm gonna flip through this bit very quickly because I know that we got a time thing here the violence trauma vortexes is the generational trauma I can talk forever on this I have been standing up and talking for 25 years in Queensland out of the cave communities in the Kimberley 's through the territory in South Australia in New South Wales trans generational trauma it 's like nobody wants to hear the subjugation of indigenous peoples the creation of culturally unsafe learning and living environments the abuse of children well documented children put into rabbit runs to be used for sex by the released of prisoners the the old eggs it 's well documented everywhere and yet we 're still not talking about it incarceration of young people in one part of Queensland 90% of the kids in one juvenile detention centre our Aboriginal kids have a look at it building more prisoners to create cultures of violence and poverty I met with Phillip Braddock when he was the Attorney General and I said to him every time you build a new prison you 're building a terrorist training center our kids go through the system up into prison and they learn how to fight colonization is traumatization I 'm not going to talk to the diagram I 'll just quickly talk to the layers the physical violence of the frontier epidemics starvation 's massacres Henry Reynolds has just released his latest book The Forgotten Wars read it the structured violence of the state people sitting behind a desk and just had detention centres established across Australia I can give you the history of every single one of the old reserves in Queensland and I can tell you when the abuses moved in and what happened there were been my family comes from aravind like a family at shurberg and finally the psychosocial dominance the cultural and spiritual genocide that destroys a sense of who we are what we are I 'm not going to talk this too much because I just want to get on to some other things but I just wanted quite something this is from the bringing them home report and this is from a psychiatrist talking about it a man that he was working with having flashbacks of traumatic events caused such psychiatric pain that the person may start to drink heavily or use other psychiatric subjects like Oh of substances and if they haven 't hadn 't used alcohol I probably would have committed suicide and yet we have such high suicide rates the incidence of harm of self and harm of others is very closely related 9 out of 10 women in the northern nine out of ten of them were Aboriginal women I could give you stats until it came out of your ears and you got sick of them that 's not what 's going to change we need to know how to work together so trauma creates experiences of loss fear powerlessness helplessness contraction exhaustion and now people don 't want to engage with the system they don 't trust the police anymore they don 't trust the services anymore because the services have not been meeting their needs and I 'll just quote this one again because it fits into what louise has been saying and it 's what i sent to kevin rudd childhood trauma including abuse and neglect is probably the single most important public health challenge we face a challenge that has the potential to be largely resolved by appropriate prevention and intervention and what are the outcomes of trauma so think of this community here let me just stop for a moment and say in the community where I am living in let 's call it the Aboriginal community which is a collection of communities or actually doing really well they own businesses they 're getting on with the life they 're just doing really well what some of the upper class in Australia there 's a middle group of people who you know they 're renting their homes they 're working in jobs the kids are getting into high school and some of them are graduating and they 're not doing too badly but there is a small but core group of Aboriginal people across this continent who are falling through the cracks and as you sit with them you can actually walk back with them to the stories across generations you might start with the little one that 's just played up in school so badly the little seven year old who tried to hang themselves in the schoolyard put a thing around their neck and tied it to it put it to a thing and a teacher found that child hanging and they sent him over to the special school where I 'm working and didn 't tell them that this little one who is blue the face when they cut him down a child sense of safety and Trust in childhood trauma of self-worth Evolis effect a hearing sense of self emotional distress shame grief self and other destructive behaviors and so we label them as bad kids and when they go into adolescence we say although these are these are really naughty kids are we going to put them into juvenile detention or that 's for the boys for the girls although our percentage of girls in juvenile detention is about 70% in some places unmodulated aggression difficulty negotiating relationships with caregivers peers model partners with a clear link between suicide alcoholism and other drug misuse sexual promiscuity physical activity smoking obesity and mental distress including depression adults more likely to develop heart disease cancer stroke and a prison populations of full of people with childhood histories of trauma and we keep building more prisons I just want to tell you the trauma stories of two little fellas I worked with they were very challenging Dobby his earliest memory this is in central Queensland by the way thank you for the conversation we had was taken his mother was taken from 3 years of age he had no idea why she was taken away she was taken to hospital actually witnessed many instances of violence on his mother and others and when he was sat down by workers he was living in a cardboard box under a house he had found a safe place for himself Willy on the other hand was taken from his mother at two because she was in domestic violence no support for the mother just he was taken from her placed in foster care where he was sexually abused he was returned to his mother of eight years of age by which time he was suicidal and thence when I was contacted the behaviors of Dobby and Willy Dobby looked about six or seven skinny small hey it was the brightest kid I 'd ever met he didn 't mean he 'd come in the door Chooch he wanted to check out everything every place every exit in that building he asked me a hundred questions and he wanted real answers I couldn 't keep up with him I tried he got fifty dollars out of in the room I still don 't know how he did it he was a survivor and he burned a hole in our dairy blanket he absolutely was focused on the ceremonial process that we used in our programs where we did a smoking and we read the diary around a we had I had a scarf I called it the Deary blanket that was given to me from people from utopia and he was so taken by this ceremony that we were doing that he wanted to be there and recreated for himself so he lit the candle and Berta Holland and every thought everybody thought that was terrible I thought it was beautiful and I still have that scarf and I still have the hole and that reminds me of dobie Willy it was overweight he wouldn 't come near me his head hung down he was routine he retreated into himself he wouldn 't speak unless I spoke to him and then he would answer and syllables he had no enthusiasm at all and that 's some of the kids that I 'm seeing today now they doesn 't make they can 't make sense of so Doby we 're stuck on on if you want to learn the language use the language of the hyperactivity hyper vigilance panic rage mania and Willy was stuck on off hyper disconnected disassociated exhausted dead depressed Dobby is more likely to hurt another person Willy killed himself in fact I should say that the system I went to try to find Dobby a year later he had had 23 foster parents in a year and when I tried to find him a year later the department had lost his file okay I 'm going to move out of this all right stick to the victimization loss and grief this is Frank 's octa ox Berg 's work after victimization people people enter at a downward socio-economic spiral because of psychological social and the casual impairment they are more likely to be victimized by the system and there are more likely to victimize others just by not perhaps being a good parent many victims for example women who have been beaten or children have been abused or also likely to be trauma so let me just stop for a moment and say there 's a difference between victimization loss and grief and it was interesting in Timor when I was working there the students they said to me and they were trauma workers said to me what 's the difference between victimization loss and grief and traumatization I 've never had an every from student ask me sorry an Australian student asked me that the bereaved feels loss the victim feels like a loser the bereaved feels sad the victim feels humiliated the brief may feel as a part of her self has been ripped away the victim feels to manage to push down in a hierarchy of dominance exploited and invaded now of use those words deliberately victim because in victim in victimization there is generally always traumatization if you want to learn more about the difference between the loss in grief and and trauma get a hold of the presentation I did yesterday so what is my response to that and I 'll just actually say that Alice Miller has talked about this in her work for their own being is to have been profoundly heard as a child having been hurt not being able to have anyone believe the pain the distress of your hurt not being able to express that pain that distress so slap shut up you know if you really want something to cry for I 'll give you another one not to have had access to education where you can in to intellectualize understand where this pain comes from and not to have had children of your own where you can take out your distress in some way it took me a long time to accept that one until I then clearly remembered standing in front of my two-year-old child who just drawn the most beautiful drawing on the wall and shouting at her you know if you 're stupid and I thought my god you know with words we heard so in all the work I did in central Queensland looking at trauma trails and trying to understand how we could turn this around this is my prescription first of all we need to create culturally safe environments there may have to help as here let 's hold those stories as people start to then hear themselves pick up the stories in different ways and then start to make sense of the stories and we create the safe place so that they can feel the feelings Aboriginal people did this all the time on this continent they had ceremonies and ritual where we 're allowed to feel the feelings and dance and movement and shouting at each other to get rid of the anger as a health process as well as the law process we need to take the courage to move through the layers of loss and grief to reclaim our sacred selves we all need to know our stories who are your ancestors what journeys did they take to bring you to this country we now call Australia what is the movement what are the stories they collected on the way that allowed you to be sitting in this room today with the goodwill to do something make a change for children who are your ancestors so healing children from trauma what we did was we developed and we applied the the practice of emotional healing through a century and tactile therapeutic work in nature discovery narrative art music dance movement plays storytelling and performances using structured and unstructured play and we used the narrow developmental rational rationale for healing trauma the brain stem every child deserves to be conceived and born with respect for who and what that child is that baby is if I had a magic wand and I was going to start early early intervention I 'd start with the young mums of 13 and 14 who are now falling pregnant because they have no choice and I would start hearing that baby in utero as I 'm healing the young mum and I 'm healing her mum and her grandma and uncle you asked me about the offender 's the young men who hurt and harm my response to you is that their children still they 're repeating the harm that was repeated on them and even though we do not accept the things that they 've done we need to respond to their needs too and it works it works in the prisons the midbrain a prison once and I was working with a group of young men who were in there Aboriginal men who were in there for extremely extreme acts of violence and one young man had a filmic lizard that just lived here on him Wow you know and then when you heard what that young fella didn 't you think wow what the limbic system zero to three to four facilitate emotional regulation dance art music play zero to four for the Cattell quarter encourage abstract thought the ability to reflect reflect the ability to be mindful storytelling writing drama theater art and music these are always Aboriginal people these ways where Aboriginal people did on this continent before cook to heal any trauma that they were living with it 's time Australia learn from us and find me the heart brain resonance not resilience I 've met some very resilient people in prison people who have survived most incredible atrocities and will go out and do it again they 're resilient they know how to survive what I want to build in our schools is resonance empathy so the model the kids needs and the kids designed this this artwork for us they wanted music dance theater bodywork and we they had so much fun what about just stunned me okay um something is happening here and I don 't quite know what it is okay working with children why we did what we did was about attachment and bonding belonging child rights value himself and developing a meaning of coherence of what had happened while we were working with the kids their grannies would come in and I can remember saying one time to this group of elders who were in real despair about what was happening with the kids look you know just come from this international communist you want me to get my projector out and just kind of put it up on the wall and I 'll talk you through what I 've just presented to all these you know intellectual dudes from all around the world and I just put it up on this corrugated on wall in a shed out in western New South Wales and I was there for a little time talking to me and she was crying and she took my hands and she said so it 's not our fault then we 're not bad people that is the message that white Australia has given to Aboriginal Australia while they incarcerate our kids while they remove our kids well they do not give us the services that we have a human right to receive so we did all this stuff while we did it will we realise the wheelie approach it began after a child had been raped we wanted to have people understand that developmental trauma that results from such experiences we saw that in all our work and unskilled workforce working with our children what we did we worked with what I 've just said the theory base of neurodevelopmental trauma so we can actually listen to you guys we can actually listen to what the Western world and learn from it we still haven 't got that reciprocity so we actually built on indigenous healing practice as recognised in the work of Bruce Perry using cultural inhaling children from trauma and we learned that this had to with activities that supported emotional release into a trauma healing skills and what we found is that the workers who came into that master 's course which AMA ties themselves that they had never in all of the educational opportunities they 've been given in higher education in Australia been allowed to address the deep pain that they were carrying but they had a deep need to work with others what happened was that we had grandparents walk up to this school sixth climate at some times and cried at the school to find out why it was their grandchildren now wanted to be at school as we were putting this into practice in the school we found that children who had previously been to a playing truant over and over again never missed today we it 's gone a bit funny here that 's because I put this one over this morning I remember one calm morning I was at the school and this little kid turned up and he had a little t-shirt on and no shoes and her and a pair of flimsy shorts and the next my god they breed them tough out here that 's all my thought but the next day the kids from the school turned up with warm clothing for that child those children taught me something more about being human so what the teacher said is we have the freedom now to teach in the way that the children need it is not insignificant that this Melaleuca place is based on the land that is about educating education we have to go back to those principles of how we educate each other to work with each other in a good way the teachers said that the children are so excited about learning now and they 're not angry anymore what did the children say I like music because I can feel the beat through my body yeah these were kids that who were so disassociated every time they were sitting in a big fight they would just get out of their body and just sit there I like dance because I can tell different story is a like body work because I feel calm and relaxed I like theater because I angry as the lion or the tiger or whatever I like art because I can 't make mistakes from a little fella who had been told all his life he was born in prison his mother died in prison and he had been told all his life he was a mistake he 's doing beautifully now he 's transitioned back to school to another school over just near where I live and the principal of that school is so impressed with him from a child who was dis failing I like nature discovery because I can learn things when I am outside what are the outcomes last week I had just after we did the professional educational program with all the teachers from the school last week I had to long term staff nobles tell me today was the best week they had ever had at the school interesting that was the week after you had conducted your school developmental day on trauma-informed care and practice through Educare talk about the Aboriginal people in town of the need to clone the school and the staff this is a vote of 't cost the government anything teachers were transformed forth um from lots of good teachers to grade teachers showing real outcomes with students they are holding the children and the stories waiting for other sectors to take up their responsibilities and children now are transitioning back to other schools in the region with remarkable results the good news is that we had at that school recently a special Women 's Day celebration and one of the terms we call all the children cherubs I wanted to show his work he had done in class his auntie his mum and his nan and also his little sister he held her hand he walked around the classroom time to teach her different things that he had learnt at school like counting in the alphabet sometimes I think the education that can be taken to home to the siblings particularly when the children and the chubs value themselves learners and teachers we 're turning that whole concept upside down and what we also focused on is the need for women 's healing and for men 's healing so as with women 's business healing exploring the classical and the contemporary roles of indigenous men Aboriginal men in the family and in society and in law Loras both health process owner and a law at law LRE process all aww process so everything was done in aboriginal society through structure in this situation also symbolizes men 's sexuality masculinity and knowledge and it is we become elder and we take on eldership uncle Richard that we apply knowledge and turn it into wisdom which is what I heard this morning thank you there was also a women there is also a woman within all of the men 's work as there is a man within all the woman 's work we also developed a response to the need for parenting parents said to us they didn 't know how to parent so we put some parenting packages together and we ran them and we asked them to show us a leadership by example and knowledge and nurturing how they were going to look after the children and they started to reclaim the transgenerational strengths of positive parenting through defining pride and identity and beliefs the children 's children and beyond the barriers of past practices and policies that disempowered so many of our families so what is healing first of all it 's an awakening somebody wants to change their life it 's a sense of safety and support and security it 's about developing community support it 's rebuilding family and community connections healing is an ever deepening sense of self-knowledge I am still waiting for this country we now called Australia to start to learn from what it has done to itself since it first sailed into Sydney Cove at 1788 it has applied practices on the people who lived in this country on this land that we now called Australia for the last 50 60 thousand 70 thousand years it is applied the same principles that worked for it in England prisons dislocating people from land to make way for sheep the woolen mills and cattle in Australia and it is now having not learned anything applying those same principles to those people we now call refugees asylum seekers we need to deepen our self-knowledge reflect on who we are as to go back to the ceremonies that strengthened our cultural and spiritual dinner identities Healing is cultural and spiritual at its deepest level it 's about transformation and transcendence I want to finish by saying poor memmer did this work in Queensland and this is what he found and I guess I just saw I just wanted to be a bit spicy this morning and say it found that there were major problems in mainstream programs with a lack of cultural safety for Aboriginal people Aboriginal kids Aboriginal families there was a lack of employment of Aboriginal people in the services skilled Aboriginal people there was a lack of skills in those employed and there was a lack of theory attached to the practice and practice attached to the theory so across Aboriginal Australia we don 't talk about health in the way that non Aboriginal Australians talk about health in fact from one group of people from Deborah both of their drivers work in nourishing terrains of Aboriginal Australia she writes about Ponyo Ponyo well-being being well and Aboriginal people define this as feeling and being strong happy knowledgeable school now are taking care of each other they 're looking out for each that they 're actually holding each other in a good way beautiful I remember being at a conference once where people made a comment about how Aboriginal women dressed who came to the conference not having any understanding that what the head on was actually the clothes they 'd bought from a secondhand shop it was called where they 'd come to to be safe safe both in the sense of being within the law and in the sense of being cared for it 's a dual responsibility and a right the right to be safe and the responsibility to care for others so on this continent we now call Australia we need to understand that when people and country are will the flow of energy keeps both strong healthy and fruitful we cannot be a nation unless we look after the land we live on we cannot be a nation of people who will be honored and respected around the world and as we open our doors to those who as we have done since before when people visited this continent to trade with us we cannot be a nation of people who will be respected for who we are and what we are unless we have a deep soul-searching of what we 're doing this day now on behalf of children Aboriginal children non Aboriginal children who have a history across this land and the people who would like to continue to come here because the places where they live at the moment are unsafe for them so I guess I 'd like to just leave you with this kind of discussion point to the Commonwealth Government says they have three objectives for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people children in schools safe communities and people in jobs well we can show you we 've got kids in school doing really well they 've exceeded this little school the children in this school the napkin plan determinations on literacy and numeracy levels against all the other schools in the region but more importantly they 're now emotionally literate they know how to engage with each other in a good way but they have shown have sexual trade of kids we still have drugs rolling up the highway hitting our communities big time and when we do have Aboriginal people in jobs they continue to deep disrespected for the knowledge they have so I just like to leave their question for you thank you _"

a practitioner supervisor project manager trainer and senior manager in child predict protection and she previously worked as the regional child protection manager in the northern metropolitan region she has experience in support services and residential care for children and families at risk we were hoping to have Joe Tucci here this morning he 's unwell but luckily for us we have Gregory Nicolaos CEO and lead consultant psychologist of the Australian childhood trauma group the Australian childhood trauma group specializes in childhood trauma and attachment providing support services to individuals government agencies non-government agencies and schools including secondary consultation training program review assessment referral and research and I 'll cut short those biographies there 's so much more that these people have done but let 's start straight away I just would like to start by asking you Gregory and now to tell us a bit about the sort of children that that you are dealing with we direct work they have done with children can you tell us a bit about yours children they just a most what we do is with children who want to tell their stories but they don 't tell stories in the way that perhaps your own children will tell their stories they tell their stories by saying you or they tell their stories by saying I don 't want to talk to you because of the experience of that alts but nevertheless they are telling their stories and it 's my belief that what we have to learn is to become behavior interpreters or just like we have language interpreters we have behavior interpreters and not get so overwhelmed by the way that are their stories so that 's a lot of our work in looking at listening to children 's stories thank you um well not as poetically as as Gregory put it I think a lot of the children that we work with in take to within Victoria for those who don 't know we are a program that is funded to work with child protection clients the majority are indeed children who ostensibly when we were set up it was for children who was showing these difficulties through emotional behavioral disturbance or who were at risk of showing those difficulties through their behavior needless to say we get very few referrals for children who are not already showing those concerns with their behavior and in that I include the the babies who the foster parent may describe as oh no she 's great she just sleeps all day and you think no that 's not great so it 's really paying attention to both those those external behaviors that we are probably more attuned to but equally paying attention to those behaviors or indications of the internal turmoil that we may require more support and training for foster parents for teachers for parents to help them to actually recognize those signs as well Thank You Annette now do we have questions from the floor yes if you can just wait and we 'll bring a microphone over so we can all hear and if you 'd like to specifically address your question to one of the panelists please with my colleague Alison weeks from the University of Canberra I 'm a landscape architect and allison 's and occupational therapist we 're going to be working on doing some design work for this physical space we 've spoken a lot and heard a lot about humans as agents of distress and also agents of healing but I 'd like your comments about place design and space and nature as agents of healing in this prize could I just give a comment on that because about five years ago this very issue came up with me I went to a residential house and I was disgusted at the environment itself and I was wondering why in the healing process we thought of the mind I mean we kind of thought of the body but we never thought of place environment so we 've had a research project with the school of architecture interior design will be on building looking at that very thing how does space itself add to the healing of children young people or even adults for that matter in schools it 's absolutely critically important you mentioned of your slides energy comes off everything there 's energy in the space because of yours people but there 's energy because of the sort of cheers the color in the room the lights and so forth and we can actually change space to ensure children feel more safe and secure at different times we can use light at nighttime when we put on our lights on our houses and everybody goes you 'd like this instead of closes down with children who find it difficult to sleep we can use light to change the atmosphere in the home so that people fit begin to feel safer in order to decompress so it 's incredibly important the environment in space I was going to say that in fact again in reference to Judy 's what of duty slides about understanding the whole brain and the from the rain stem up to the cortex that understanding the context of space and place as it relates to the way we take in information from our environment so we understand that we differ in taste and that we differ in music I remember better than Perry Como needless to say I think he was right now but we don 't necessarily appreciate that people will also respond to a difference in tactile sensation or a difference in smell or a difference in the way they 're appropriate ception their physical body will actually take in information and if we can help children feel comfortable in their own skin and we can use the environment both things like sensory gardens and lighting and fabric as well as direct more perhaps more mainstream therapeutic input if we think of that in a holistic way then we are increasing our chances of helping the children feel calm when we need them to feel calm and helping them to become more alert when we need them to take in new content to new information Judy you had at the top of one of your lists there a safe culturally sensitive place is what children really need so in terms of the melaleuca place garden which is just waiting to be developed what are some practical things that the people who are going to be doing this work with with their hands I had a grandson who are just in the first years of his development would sit besides different plans and just play with the leaves and smell them and smell them and children do that all the time and I just want to go on to the place thing because it is such an important thing I actually don 't work inside and I get called into a community where there 's been 21 and risks of child sexual assault the little girl that was the suicide it into that community in timor-leste in PNG and I asked people to take me where they need to go where we 're going to do the work so if I 'm doing extensive working up and in on community they gave us when we first went in there this room and the building you know the administration building and you had to it I 'm knocking off the door when you went in and out and I said to them you comfortable in here do you feel safe in here and I went look that the people who would you like to go we went down into the middle of the community and for the 18 months that I was working there we sat under the mango trees and we said different it separately with the men with the women and the children doing work but everybody in the community knew what we were doing and we sat on the ground under the mango trees and once they 've got about that and going back to melaleuca place if you 've got lots of things you think you got to have all these things inside for children to do things with them make story maps with well you know if I say to a child can you make me a story and this will go for walk down here and they will things up and they 'll make you a story you know you know how you know what 's and play it but they 'll make you a story out of the flowers the the seeds that the rocks that they find and as they 're in that place place is such an important thing and for site that 's been a massacre site they immediately can feel the energy and it 's not a safe place one of the great things about I 've learned about the model of melaleuca place is that the clinicians will also be able to well they will be going out into the community to places where children feel safe where they feel comfortable not necessarily just at this beautiful building that we 've all seen today and I 'm wondering professor Newman if you would like to expand on that idea of creating a safe comfortable space where that whether child feels safe it look I think that 's absolutely fundamental that the way we need to operate is from the child 's perspective and children even the very young I think we frequently under arrest by their capacity to have a discussion around those sorts of issues so the language that we use is apps is really important so talking to children about concepts of safety and Trust they know exactly and with children who are pre-linguistic so the very young who I would work with I think we we create a place and a way of interacting with the babies that 's very much around the baby being able to communicate and have the experience that someone 's thinking about them and listening to you can you give us a practical example of that Lewis look very very simple a baby might that say so traumatized baby might be quite wary of looking I would literally sit with that that baby be respectful of the distance I think that 's important for any dramatized child at any age but be there and I would use my tone of voice and non verbals and I would literally say to that baby I know that you 're scared and I 'm going to just sit here quietly with you and we can just sit together and give the baby time and small babies they will you know if they 're able to engage in that way they will then at some point wake up they might give you a furtive glance and then I would say to them I saw you looking at me so it 's a way of the safety of feeling of being with someone thank you yes I feel like a roadie at a concert or something um I just want to add to that because there was a guy called I still Adam Phillips who 's a British psychoanalyst and he wrote a beautiful paper called the magical out of a desperate person and one of the things he said he was talking about tantrums that child children have and he was talking about kind of mainstream environments but I think we can use it to think about kids who experienced trauma he said one of the reasons that when a child throws a trauma we 're sorry there I go 14 slip the reasons that when a child throws a tantrum and we send them off to the bedroom or we threaten them with going to bed early or we take away the Nintendo Wii do something we deprive them of something is because we as the adult cannot be their pain and distress and I think that happens in the work that we do that very often these children of letting us know be able to manage the stress i 'm experiencing but i do have the ability to let you know out there the difficulty is there very often with carers and teachers and even workers when we see this level of distress that can be frightening for us as adults the very often we want to close it down rather than to be in the presence of it and the lease is a nice example of that child who was trying to make contact but saying I don 't want to be I don 't want you I don 't want to be attached that 's too painful she was able to sit with the pain of the child and over time that child will come to the adult and I see this again and again and my practice and other clinicians practice that when they 're able to sit with the pain of the child the child will come toward you ultimately and but we have to learn to do that as adults and as a country we have to learn to sit with the pain of indigenous people and hearing another question from the floor yes down here I 'll come back to you thank you my name is Fiona and this is for the ways i am especially a child watching indigenous communities i 'm currently a foster carer for four children four extraordinarily traumatic background one we have had these children for seven years they have been with us and between them we 've probably been in 64 the homes before they came to us we are now reaching adolescents we do not have a diagnosis of a safe for them global developmental delay a dilemma is we understand about trauma trauma doesn 't get them support we don 't know how to work with the system to ensure they will be get into at all yes now I think you raised in a really significant issue that the system up to date hopefully we 're talking now about systemic change around this issue but the system to date has very much focused on additional supports being tied to a diagnostic category so we 've had this whole process of squeezing children into diagnostic categories sometimes for the additional support so I remember when one of the first jobs i did as a child psychiatrist was to be presented by an education department whole list of children 's names descriptions of their behavior and i had to write down i believe this child who I never saw I believe this child has a conduct disorder or an oppositional defiant disorder and is needs extra help there 's something fundamentally wrong with that and I think what you 're saying I 'm very very clearly is that the the trauma framework and concept hasn 't been integrated so we 've had this this sort of parallel universe where all of us out there and doing the work understand the reality of child trauma and know that we 're dealing with the aftermath and long-term consequences of trauma but that 's not supported and that 's why I made the point about the dsm-5 not working particularly well around these issues the failure to get developmental trauma as a recognized condition so I think we still need to advocate for that I 'm personally as I understand the terrible I 'm person not in favor of squeezing children into diagnosis that it don 't understand the condition but you know sometimes we have no choice and many of the parents ice b2 and carers are obviously in that situation but the issue is it doesn 't help the child we can 't name the trauma talk about the trauma and understand trauma and we 'll just keep you know repeating that sort of error so hopefully somewhere like this develops and contributes in a major way to that debate about what we call you know the impact of trauma on children and how do we get it recognized first of all I think I 'm right in saying I couldn 't quite hear you that you 're working with indigenous children you 've got your a foster carer for in these children are indigenous but we have worked in indigenous communities before you know okay first of all I want to recognize your pain I could feel your distress the second thing is that I don 't know who else in this room has spent most of their lives get real come on you know most of the people that where kids were working with mums were working with dads were working with in the prisons we 're working with trauma stories and the longer and the more intense we get and the more focus we get on saying that hopefully this government 's going to other governments are going to take notice because the greatest investment we can make in Australia is to start to do the healing that needs to be done across all those generations including your children I just wanted to recognize your pain the distress you must be feeling things in it and Gregory would you like to comment as well on this I think um as you 've portrayed very clearly one of the things that we always need to be conscious of is there is nothing more crucial than that relationship for the child that 's within the home and the relationship that can provide the skin to skin contact whether it 's an infant whether it 's an adolescent and then and just the the intimacy of that day to day and holding the children but we also need to have better ways of holding those who are doing the holding and we need to be thinking about whether it 's being a squeaky wheel whether it 's going together with others and being able to advocate whether it 's finding an advocate within the system but to just keep on doing that because there is nothing more crucial for these children than them these relationships than the relationships that you and others hold I think there are two points so I have always been interested in why it is okay I 'll say there 's a different way I don 't know if anybody knows what happened in 1854 but it was the Crimea war and somebody became very famous during that time Florence Nightingale she became the mother of Nursing if you compare nursing in 1854 to nursing in 2014 you 'd go there 's no comparison no the the nurses today highly skilled highly talented in the work and probably most of you wouldn 't have an issue of when your own child into a hospital here in care sector however in australia i think is about 1910 some parts of it maybe eighteen eighty maluca house i think you 're moving towards where you need to be but i did a little calculation paul and this is absolutely not a trying to make a negative comment but maluca house has about four or five people who 'll be doing some of the healing work I heard the minister or somebody say early there are 600 children in Canberra and out-of-home care i calculated you need probably around about 70 workers to do the healing work for this group of people direct workers they 're having direct care of these 600 people why is it that in Australia we don 't actually treat children of experienced trauma or give them the services that we get to children hospital we spent two billion dollars building the Royal Children 's Hospital and Victoria two billion dollars and we had lots of telephones for children and hospitals you get cute little kids with big beers their family standing around that is fantastic how many telephones have we had four children have reason I actually don 't think it 's the government 's fault Judy I think it 's my fault and it 's your fault and it 's the grossest fault because we as a community do not stand up because I think it 's what Adam Phillips said we can 't_''_1205.58 be the pain it 's just too hard I think oh we go through we become traumatized ourselves and someone who curiously traumatized it 's too hard so people like you we don 't want to know that you 've got four kids in foster care your neighbors probably you might have good neighbors probably don 't want to know but the neighbors of the neighbors probably don 't want to know and in some sense for you to be able to do the healing work you 'll need a village to do it you have got to do it on your own and it won 't just be counselors and therapists you will need other people in the community to say will stand by you will come and cook meals so you can attend to the healing of sleep we 'll come and play with them will come and be with you when you 're distressed and when they need support that 's the only way it 's going to work I 'm absolutely certain about it that I will you will have to take greater responsibility so governments will say the committee is saying this is what they want and then government 's worked I think we do pay a lot of lip service to the idea that it takes a village to raise a child but we don 't always put that into action we feel it but we don 't always do it and I 'm not known for my mathematical ability but the same thing Gregory when I was hearing about what a great service this was and the care and the intensive support it 's going to provide two children and then you realize that there are about 400 children in out-of-home care in the acct under the age of 12 and only about 30 or so of them per year will have access to this service when at the same time we there because they have suffered some sort of trauma and why it 's while it 's fantastic that what 's happening today is happening there 's just so much more to be done Richard you had a question or a comment that you would like to put to the panel will just bring the microphone up to you when did this monstrous abuse of children begin to exist say 50 years ago and man 's knowledge is increased with the education in terms of brain surgery heart transplants travel to space and the technology that man is produced why can 't he sold his own problems and what are the statistics 50 years ago say I don 't remember much of that happening in the early 60s or late fifties when I was a teenager answer me some of those Christians and thanks Richard uncle only intends to that question I think it 's an important question I 'm 70 and the kind of violence that I 'm seeing in our communities and I 'm talking specifically about Aboriginal communities was not there when I was a child in fact violence started and then the sexual assaults that are endemic across our communities now so when the breaking air bringing them home report was finished and the Australian New Zealand Association for sequoia tree rang me and said we 're putting a response we 're putting in a response to this so we talked for a long time on the phone as they develop what they were going to do and at the end of it this fella says to me you know Judy I don 't understand why any group of people would want to put children into institutions and I laughed and said we 'll come on people to come out of his country from England that 's how they bring up their kids they put them into exclusive English public boarding schools and they bastardized them and brutalize them and then they become the leaders of the country and there was a dead silencing the other end of the phone and he said how would you know that and now I 'm going to do a personal thing he said I said because my husband was one when he was five he was raped by the time he was five and a half he got out of that place by the time here 17 walked away from his country and came to this country never ever spoke of it until he had a breakdown after he came out of PNG pulling playing people out of plane crashes out to the planting in the bodies and it triggered all his childhood memories so the trauma came back to him now I can show you I can walk through with you in Queensland every single Aboriginal reserved entertainment centers what our kids were where our people were placed and I can show you when in history the perpetrator moved in at school teacher and I can give you the evidence of that in courts of law the clergyman the mechanic who imported boo movies if the kids did what he wanted them to do for the grog and in each community Cohen Yama mornington Island palm island every single one of them you can actually map what we 're talking about today it 's come because we 've got into our communities and suddenly people were using blacks to and copy the pornography that was coming in one community in Queensland in 1988 the mechanic was importing a community of 950 people was importing 5,000 of blue movies from a camera a week now you transfer that to kids who are 14 15 years of age coming into adolescence who haven 't got a job and are watching this stuff for 10 hours a day I mean this is this is all documented and yet we 're not taking it seriously and since that time from the middle 1980s when I saw this stuff I have stood up and there 's people in this room who know me from that time I was kind of jumping up and down then saying this stuff I 'm sorry I mean I 'm really that that 's an important question but what I learned in this is my husband died last year of all those diseases I put up on that thing there and as he was coming to his deathbed he said why is it me and I said Mike I including abuse and neglect is our single most public health challenge cancer stroke heart disease all this stuff you got it all mate and he said to me go out and keep teaching it 's important that other people hear it so let me tell you the palms bought that is function with them on the prison hulks we are only now starting to talk about trauma in any way that we can name it the first world war the Second World War we have never named that a man who went to the First World War whose house for the winter the second war at First World War has at least sixty percent likelihood of having PTSD minute his son went to Vietnam one hundred percent likelihood of having PTSD we 're still dealing with the Afghan the policy come back from Afghanistan but henry reynolds book that says that forgotten laws in australia also tells us what we should be looking at in this country because in war zones the UN has only just now said that sexual violence in was during a conflict or more is a jump in there too and and just extend that in a question to Louise about the Royal Commission into child abuse at the moment and the horrific stories we 're hearing about people 's experiences and also the cover-ups that we 're hearing about to do you think that this process will affect real change in the fact that people will be more willing to listen and more willing to speak up when they suspect something is happening well look I certainly hope so I think once I 'm what we 're noticing with with the Commission just relates to the original question is how many older people are coming forward and talking about events that might have been 60 years ago and they 're giving very moving accounts of the developmental implications of that the way that that 's had such long-term and often devastating consequences some on them look it 's going to be a major issue for government I guess to decide or have so hopefully some sensible thinking about what on earth are we going to do the response to this and now I mean we 's systemic cover-up obviously that 's been very effective but the floodgates are open so everyone from the swimming coaches to whoever people are feeling at least they 've got a place to tell their story that 's hugely significant I 'm not sure what the response will be we 're certainly not prepared for the amount of support and an intervention and help that people will need I 'm personally going with a fellow that I met many years ago who 's a 69 year old man who wants to talk about his experiences as a blind infant who was institutionalized and some grossly abused for many many years and he 's got health problems and the most important thing he said to me is that this is what I 'm doing before I die and the most important thing that I can do I think is just to go with him but we 've got many people who are going by themselves and making incredible disclosures and I think everyone 's feeling a bit paralyzed about what to do with it why is that there is a piece Commission because we were we got some fun there was some funding put out some time ago and what we do know over 70 BP of seventy percent of the people presenting the Royal Commission are over at the age of 30 and over fifty percent over the age of 50 so uncle Richard I actually think what we 're discovering 50 years ago it was happening that people when talking about it so I do think today which is a good thing we 're hearing more of the stories but i do think still as a community because the issue with Rolf Harris as an example that 's been in the million of course what was noticed with Rolf Harris everyone 's burning his paintings and putting painting over his face and everything because we 're trying to eradicate him from existence I actually don 't think that 's a helpful way to go because what we do is we we try and take him out of our consciousness and say we don 't even think about why it was Rolf Harris did this we don 't even think up loving Rolf Harris as a kid and the old did whatever the venue was doing with their board I don 't want to eradicate those good experiences I had of Rolf Harris Amir 's my childhood what I want to understand is how it is Rolf Harris and the community allowed somebody like Rolf Harris to do what he did and we can 't do it unless we allow our minds to stay in there the pain of people like Rolf Harris we won 't fix it by eradicating what 's going on I think the other thing I would say is I think statistics are a little bit like diagnosis they can be very helpful and they can be very misleading and we have a society that only puts value on things we can count and that 's a problem and what we do need to do is be able to count other things and how do you count hope how do you count self-esteem how do you count cultural connection and place and all these other things which we 've talked about today as being very important to do as well as the counting I think counting is important it has a role and we didn 't count stats the same way 50 years ago that we do now so we can 't make those kind of comparisons but one of the things that the statistics are telling us now and again it feeds on what judy was saying is that the pattern is getting worse and we look at what 's happening with drugs and alcohol in our society today in Australia let alone the counts around cop maltreatment and incarceration in prisons if we do not do something as a society as a village as an individual we will not be able to afford the problems we are going to be creating for ourselves and for our children thank you we have time for one more question before the break for lunch who would like to ask that question yes if we could have okay you could you we just get the microphone to you thank you I think we 've had a wonderful talk particularly from our distinguished colleague here and from all of has not come up at all the trauma history that came from the UK was gendered for men because that 's what did happen in those private schools but the gender issue is still washed under the table in this country currently and I think that 's a major issue I 've been at a meeting with distinguished people I was the only woman on this committee and these very distinguished senior men spoke about how someone says Korea shouldn 't have been upset because he had oral sex with his daughter his career was more important than what this dude to the child if we can have distinguished people in high positions I mean I went into a state of shock and then I said that 's rubbish of course it couldn 't hurt but the fact is that these people were laughing and thought there was no problem if that can happen in this society and it 's probably about the time that Julie Mensch this is at this gender issue is something that we have to talk about and I think you spoke so warmly about looking central issue that all of our speakers have brought up but when I do work on the cam service it 's not only the refugee children who are suffering its children in our own well-to-do community in the acct highly educated how on earth is this still happening now when we know it 's such an enormous problem such terrible impact on health and well-being and on the child 's future let 's we know to have courage and they get through it and often hang on to it and and make a life but we shouldn 't have to deal with them let 's put that to the panel who would like to start the response Gregory I 'm a bloke do I start the response i think i think a couple of things i was fortunate enough to have four sisters no brothers and on the baby so there was something really helpful of my understanding of kind of being in the world jokes aside I actually think we should force quotas in Parliament there should be a 50-50 split between men and women in fact maybe in one male one female MP and they all have to get together and kind of work it out I know that sounds kind of them it 's never going to happen but I think there is something about this idea and society that we 've we 've had to change it that men are put in places of in Parliament and Prime Minister 's we 've only had one woman Prime Minister and she was vilified and destroyed as a person I think it 's absolutely disgusting I don 't know how to change it me as one person I don 't know I think gender is important I wish we saw but there 's also another point but pointed part to it in primary school why is it we don 't see more men in primary schools acting as gold rod holders within a primary school so it doesn 't different institutions around the Australia will probably around the world we see reverse examples of that also that there are places where men should be that whether or not but they 're absolutely some places where there are too question about place and I always think we need more women architects whenever I go to the theatre because there just aren 't enough toilets for the women I think whether we 're talking about the child and it 's a little boy or a little girl whether we 're talking about mothering and fathering and we know how often we miss the father whether they 're present or absent their their impact whether it 's a risk factor or a protective factor the role of a grandmother but grandfather the uncle the aunties the sisters the brothers we have to be thinking about siblings for these children they are often the most long-lasting relationship any of us will ever have is with a brother or sister and yet we don 't prove League these key relationships I was on a plane recently like Judy were on separate planes for 35 hours and the around the world and I met a young man who we got into a conversation for some reason about mental health and babies and he said all and I leave you know what 's really important we stopped using baby talk and I thought wrong and wrong I said well actually baby talk or mother ease you know let 's is known in so many different cultures as being a key sequential step in language development and in that achievement that parenting infant relationship and how do we privilege that mother infant speak or whether it is somebody else is doing it and that 's it and if you just change the word educate to play on with you and we just talked the student had to come and tell us to shut up we were keeping other passengers away but I do think we have to have these conversations in every place we can hopefully by invitation or we get a bad reputation but we do need to be brave and actually say the uncomfortable things that are hard for people and that includes the way we talk about the way women talk about women the way women talk about men the way men talk about women the way men talk about men Judy Louise I 'll have to ask just yeah this will be critical issue here and again I 'm talking from what I know within Aboriginal Australia what I am seeing at the moment is that we 're focusing on young men who are moving into JJ adult prison we 're just upsetting that our young girls are going to have babies and I would say that it 's not just gender it 's race race and gender go together there is still high level of racism out there so what I have seen in the last number of time that I 'm working on the ground is an attitude about our young girls look you know she 's she 's she 's she 's only with the truckee she 's just doing this and that no case he 's going to her baby all the time she 's 14 or 15 and she 'll have another one and another one and another one so just two things that I think that about gender that we 've really got to got it get on top of is um I said with a young woman palm island 28 years of age she had were was just that she 'd had eight babies six them have been removed from her and she just had a newborn baby and I was sitting with her with the two-year-old and I was stunned at the kind of language the really sexualized swearing language he was using on this little two-year-old all the time that we were in that room together I felt sick and yet I could see that she had never had any other socialization I 'm talking about a young girl that was brought into my office when I was in the University and hey sorry I 'm not in Southern Cross now retired and she was brought in for me to witness that she was with a young boy who had had a court-mandated thing to say that he was not to associate with her she was seven months pregnant she was 14 years of age and his grandparents a grandfather was a non sexual offender I had to witness that so I could make a statement to the authorities about this what was happening she is now 19 years of age and she and she is an alt + alt alcoholic she was the most beautiful young child I had seen when she was 14 at seven months pregnant her face is totally disfigured now and she is just into alcohol and other drug misuse gender is the most critical issue along with race because there is this concept that will focus on the young fellows the young boys but how these girls are just going to have babies and you know quite often they don 't have a choice in this so I think we 've got a lot of work to do okay Louise would you like to serve it and grub I got a grumpy pill today I think it 's just driving home and I think I mean obviously genders crucial I work pretty much exclusively with young young women who 've been being traumatized and in a preventive way but I think the issue to broaden it is about values I 'm the challenge is how how can we promote values which are more typically as associated with the feminine which is not necessarily represented in politics or that but the values are about from voting healthy connectedness promoting relationships valuing as a society parenting as a function valuing the contribution of the very young and children to all of us so somewhere in this we have to focus on gender but we also have to focus on the infant in that discussion thank you thank you so much and I could listen to you all day but I know that lunch beckons and you 've got a really full activity at list of activities for this afternoon as well so I just like you to put your hands together to thank our panelists Louise Newman Julia kissing Atkinson Annette Jackson and Gregory nicolau thank you so much and thank you for such excellent questions _"

    "text": "thank you very much it 's really wonderful to be here for this event and I as I said at the opening this morning had been involved in some of the initial discussions when there was a vision and there was a vision to actually provide therapeutic treatment using a trauma and attachment based model for these children who are so vulnerable and at that time it was it was marvelous to have that chance to to really talk about the implications of a lot of the science that 's been going on for some time about why we should be doing this it 's an interesting issue that science sometimes pointers in one direction but actually getting that translated getting that on the ground and getting that to inform our practice can sometimes take a bit longer but the good news is here we are thinking very much about how to use our better understanding of early intervention what that actually means and put that that into practice so I 'm going to just outline for you some of the current thinking about the implications of early trauma mainly great service like this might actually be able to incorporate do some research around do some training when we 're looking at people 's trauma-informed practice and open up the discussion for us very clearly at the moment we have I think a much more complex understanding of the impact of early adversity in the broader sense so talking about attachment disruption inconsistent care emotionally disturbed care right up to the more extremes that sadly we see where children can be abused and neglected of course we have to put this into a context trauma and poor care of children happens in vulnerable and stressed communities it can happen to vulnerable children and sadly and I 'll get this in early it can happen as a result of government policy so we have at the moment a policy which is allowing the indefinite and arbitrary detention of babies and young children in situations such as on Christmas Island and those children are facing deportation to situations like Nauru and Manus Island as you can imagine the parents finding themselves with new babies and somewhere like Christmas Island distressed and despairing the media you 'll be aware that up to 10 of those women have attempted suicide that 's a result of government policy and I think it 's very much very important that as we think about those of us who are in academic or clinical practice roles we also have a role to speak up about government policy when it 's damaging and harmful and when it 's actually something that is in our area so this is not an issue I believe that any of us can remain neutral on at the current time those of us who work in child protection and for the care of children think about all children we think about the asylum seeker children particularly at the moment as some of the most vulnerable in our situation we know sadly that those children who are exposed to some of these extremes of adversity are going to have potentially long-term harm to sensitive neurological and behavioral and emotional development the association between early adversity and mental health problems is also well known and I say this sometimes a little bit despairingly because we have us and many people in this room and colleagues and friends here have also been involved in raising these issues in our various circles repeatedly we should be doing more early intervention we need to have more targeted and focused interventions for some of the most vulnerable may be waiting until adolescence or young adulthood when a disorder might appear is a little bit late which is a sad thing but we do know a lot more about the developmental pathways and the risk factors for disturbance and maybe that 's where we be targeting some more of our limited resources we know the impact on societies and communities of early abuse and trauma it 's not just the relationship to diagnosable mental health problems it 's also a relationship to social exclusion to poor social functioning to relationship breakdowns people coping or attempting to cope with the misuse of drugs and alcohol so a whole range of social impacts of abuse and trauma also need to be highlighted and importantly we do know even if we can 't always implement it as much as we would like about the helpful this is one of my experimental babies baby Tully now babies as you know very keen to participate in research volunteered she put her hand up and there she was and so she 's obviously a very young a young child and we 're thinking about someone like Tully in terms of the rapid neurological development that 's going on in the first three years of her life she 's actually a very healthy and fortunate child him in many ways but many are not and the damage and the implications have been traumatized during the early years is something that is very difficult to translate into adequate services and to preventive approaches maybe because some of the damage if you like might not be apparent until later if we look at mental health in patients in a health system from that perspective around seventy percent of adult patients in the hospital system report histories of early trauma and abuse this is obviously regardless of diagnosis I should say so regardless of the type of mental health problem the rates of early abuse and adversity are very high we risk of ongoing trauma and what we might think of is revitalization very commonly we 're seeing patterns in people 's lives where self-protection becomes difficult and obviously then in a transgenerational sense the impact of early on parenting capacity and the difficulties that people who 've experienced abuse and trauma might have in seeing themselves as an attachment figure as a protective person and the conflicts and problems that can present with so again an ideal opportunity for true early intervention might be working in the antenatal period if we 're fortunate to see prospective parents at that point you are more likely to have parenting difficulties or child protection difficulties they are a group to work with and a particularly important group who are open to psychological support and work in many cases many people despite the fact that they 've had histories of early trauma and neglect absolutely focused on trying to get it right with their child and I think we need to move away from a rather pejorative stance that many services have taken where we tend to put people with histories of abuse and 're going to fail when in fact many of the young women that I work with who have very troubled histories absolutely focused on getting it right and work very effectively with a service if the service is focused on their needs and actually relates to them which is maybe a shift when we think about traditional early parenting and mental health services if we work with young people we 're obviously in the mental health system seeing many distressed young people who might be making disclosures of trauma and abuse who have not been able to do that before and there is considerable concern obviously about safety during that process of disclosure and also when we 're thinking young people social media we think about the contagious effect of distress that can easily and rapidly go through a group of young people in my health area in Victoria we 've been responding to a tragic situation of what 's defined as a suicide cluster we 've lost 15 young people over a 12-month period this is despairing and we need to look in a very broad way to try contribute to that one of which and we know a lot about the background of these young people is early trauma and abuse and great difficulties in using other people as secure basis in attachment to your theory terms or finding a place of safety and that sort of level of alienation and despair compounded with drug and alcohol abuse can contribute to these terrible and tragic situations what we do know then is that early trauma sets up what we might call neuro vulnerability in other words thinking about a nervous system and a response system a brain system that 's vulnerable to later stress and trauma so that trauma is not going to in a simple way cause a particular problem but its associated with risk increase risk for the entire range of mental health problems and importantly very poor psychosocial outcome the other controversial issue I guess is important to talk about is the use of language and the sorts of language and diagnosis particularly in the mental health system that we use to talk about trauma which I mean I 'm have a particular view that tend to fall back on diagnosis when that 's probably not a very appropriate thing to do that if something 's related to trauma and traumatic experience we should call it that and many people that I work with have a diagnosis of so-called borderline personality disorder that might mean something in in terms of a description if you like of some of the difficulties that those people face but it has become and this is the problem it 's become a pejorative label to describe people that we find difficult we as in the system we as in the clinicians or the responders and so we often use that term in a pejorative or negative sense sadly we sometimes use it of course about our colleagues so look up our colleague down the hallway is a very difficult person to get onto on with they must be personality disordered I think we have to be very careful about and are using these sorts of terms but on the other hand and I 'm aware that there is an argument i 'm not meaning to be dismissive of it amongst that sometimes having a name or a description of what 's going on for them is helpful so i have had some people say to me that they welcome a diagnostic label I think there are different different views on this but it 's all about how we use something to validate people 's experience whatever we call this field that we work in it is essential that we maintain a commitment to people 's human rights and treat people with dignity and that we have the capacity to validate their experience of whatever trauma they 've experienced and also to i think acknowledge that the mental health system on the whole has not done well with trauma or child abuse and in child mental health circles where i am some of the time there is still a discussion going on and many in this audience will have had this discussion for many years that child protection and child abuse and treatment of child trauma is not core business for Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services this is very difficult and it 's been looked at least 20 years that shift some of this thinking so we think in a simple way about the impact of higher levels of stress early on and how that can affect the developing nervous system and neuro development overall so maltreatment and abuse of children is very much a nonspecific risk factor and if you look at some of the more recent studies and I can provide you these if you 're interested in reading them but there 's been some very large-scale studies that have tried to work out statistically how much of the burden of adult type mental health problems can be associated with early adversity it 's a complex thing to do methodologically but important that we try and and look at that and roughly if you believe their statistics we can look at at least a third of adult type onset mental health problems having clear association with early severe early adversity and the impact of that 's had on neuro development now that 's actually hugely significant that 's been found in a couple of studies today what that says in practice if that 's the case then surely intervention and absolutely looking at preventive strategies that can intervene in the complex result of early trauma unfortunately that 's not easy to do and hasn 't really been fully operationalized in terms of services but there 's certainly moves to do that the dsm-5 for those of you who read the DSM every night and it 's on the bedside table have a look at five and the latest version and what you might find if you flick through it is a real lack of focus on child developmental issues less than in dsm for if that 's possible and there was a proposal to have a new disorder i 'm not particularly favor of new disorders but this was a good one because this was going to look at trauma-related developmental disorder in other words a disorder that actually spoke about the reality of the impact of early abuse and trauma on the broad range of development DSM is a highly political document and that didn 't get up which is I think really disappointing so we 're left with very limited ways of describing what we see impact on personality development children struggling to control their feelings children struggling with their interpersonal functioning children highly anxious about who is going to be there for them who they can trust some of the core issues that we deal with in therapeutic intervention with children so I think that 's something we need to keep lobbying for the current range of diagnosis that we have are not particularly helpful in describing the complexities of trauma and the way it impacts child development attachment disorders are certainly a useful notion but even then the DSM doesn 't talk very much about them so I think we have a problem in terms of conceptualizing these sorts of problems so the cost is huge and I 'm speaking to the convergence I won 't label this but obviously we 're looking at the burden of mental health problems and substance abuse are the social problem and we 're looking at the area that I mainly work in is looking at the transgenerational issues what happens when traumatized children attempt to become parents themselves what happens what are the conflicts and issues for at the prevention of what we know is a very clear association between someone who 's been abused having difficulties in their own parenting so these are day-to-day things that we come up against the easiest way of thinking about what trauma does in a neurodevelopmental ways to think about the way in which traumatic experiences and interactions so the quality of care quality of emotional interactions the way that those things are directly inscribed into the fabric of the developing brain so the brain as its growing in the early years develops around these traumatic experiences the brain then remembers trauma trauma is literally in the pathways and functions of the brain which helps us understand some of the responses of people who in adult life of experienced early trauma who might remain if you like oriented around threat and danger makes good sense if you 're an abused child growing up in a dangerous and threatening environment to be on the lookout for danger not to trust people to act first and ask questions later and a whole lot of the difficulties that we see presenting for children and emotionally and psychologically we then describe in a limited way those things as symptoms so the persons who is not trusting others who reacts very strongly to things that remind them of early trauma is sometimes described as having a PTSD or a borderline sort of disorder actually it 's much easier to think about that in terms of a traumatic response the way in which trauma itself shapes evolving attachment relationships and fundamentally the capacity to relate to others and many of the adult survivors of abuse that we speak to describe that as one of the most damaging impacts if you like of not knowing how to be with others of not knowing who 's safe to be with and feeling at risk of themselves Reeve itemized or in situations of ongoing danger so these are people who essentially have had been programmed if you like in survival mode very necessary at the time not particularly adaptive for adult functioning but the trauma that they have experienced has essentially shaped a trauma response system and the way they manage strong feelings and particularly states of anxiety and used it already several times has become for various reasons a highly contested term in our sort of area we some people talk about early in life as in and I tend to use it in that way about early intervention in the those critical years of early brain development some people speak about early in the course of disorder or if they think if they 're fortunate pre disorder some people speak about early intervening early in the onset of when someone 's having an episode of mental disorder the implications of all of this though sounds rather semantics but the implications are important because there 's been very much in terms of this funding and resourcing particularly of mental health services a lot of rhetoric around funding early intervention by which they mean in practice funding services for adolescents and young adults who certainly need services that 's really not the question but funding that and calling that early intervention at the expense of intervention earlier in the life 's and lifespan when we might actually be able to do prevention and intervene in developmental pathways so I think about some of the discussions that go on about we must do early intervention we must put the money there we 're preventing mental disorder they 're actually not many of the youth mental health services and that movement so are very much treating sadly young people who already have mental disorder whereas some of its are much more interested in preventing the development of mental disorder to that extent there 's been very effective lobbying of course going on this is highly politicized context and some people have done exceptionally in putting their case and all the best to them but it means that the rest of us who are seeing some of the very early impacts particularly of child abuse and trauma mainly need to get better at doing that sort of advocacy in that lobbying but that 's very difficult how do you maintain a developmental approach in our work and I think one of the most important things we can do is to talk about the developmental implications of what we see early on it 's actually quite hard to define how trauma in the familiar with was a trauma researcher who started writing about this some in the 80s in a very important way she talked about trauma as those events that overwhelm people 's capacity to cope and their defensive operations so if you 're a two month old baby on christmas island with a mother who 's depressed and despairing and you 're living in a harsh environment with people around you who are despairing that 's trauma how we understand that is obviously needs to be based on our developmental models of what a child of that age can do if you 're a two month baby in a dreadful situation there 's not actually terribly much you can do to protect yourself what we see in practice as we 're seeing at the moment our babies who are failing to thrive so they 're not growing babies are poorly interactive a little baby I see at the moment who 's a an asylum-seeker baby he can 't maintain any eye contact with anyone he 's seven months of age and he won 't look at anyone he 's the saddest baby I 've ever seen is baby Mohammed I mean this is a tragic so he 's a young child he 's not much he can do older children of course and we 'll use different approaches to try and protect themselves many of us are familiar in our work with children who try and get their attachment Nets men needs met anywhere the socially indiscriminate child the child with what some used to be called social promiscuity I think that 's a very nice term about meaning that the child goes to anyone and a lot of us have had those experiences of meeting a child for the first time and they say how many children have you got at home which really means can I come home with you is there room for someone else and we 've seen many examples of children who indicate and signal need and what 's important of course is that we respond to that we respond to that as a service we sponsor that as clinicians but we recognize it for what it is children have tremendous resilience and will keep signalling environments so what Lenore to pointed out that it 's easy to be overwhelmed but a developmental understanding of that means that we need to understand what people can do at different ages to protect themselves and the implications of that so when we look at the so called adult survival with so-called borderline personality disorder some of the features that those people can struggle with really sometimes the hanging around of mechanisms that they use previously when they were in situations of danger which might be maladaptive in the present sense but we need to understand where they come from and the strong desire to self-protect and how that works so the field of so-called developmental traumatology so it 's a nice sounding field has developed very rapidly to the extent now that there 's very important work looking at the role of the impact of trauma on genetic expression for example so we 're going from epigenetics to better understanding the impact of toxic stress and stress-related hormones on brain development and functioning we 've now got to the stage of trying to understand some adult mental health about developmental risk periods so those periods when the brain and nervous system are organizing and growing very rapidly great opportunities for healthy development but there are also risk periods so that would include the rapid growth that goes on in the first three years of life through four years of life it would also include adolescent development and young adulthood development and the things that are going on in the brain at that point which many of you be familiar with I think that gives us a much better way of thinking about what we call symptoms and maybe moving from that sort of language to understanding some of these issues that people present with as adaptations and the way in which people have literally literally in terms of their brain and emotional functioning needed to operate in terms of surviving dangerous dangerous environments so that I 've said these clear association of early adversity in the broader sense with adult mental health disorders and that we now need to think about trauma related mental disorder transgenerational issues are always going to be a core part of our work me or maybe not to others we have very limited research looking at some of the better ways of intervening and engaging with traumatized parents the so-called parent with borderline personality disorder having done a recent review of the literature and where there 'll be in Oxford University Press putting out a textbook which will be great on parenting a mental disorder sometime early next year but there are a handful of good outcome studies looking at interventions for these sorts of parents there are a handful of papers looking at even defining the population and what the issues are which is very surprising given that 's what we see so often in our work wouldn 't be surprising it was a rare event but it is probably the most common thing that we see and one of the most important to address so the parents that we work with the one people with their own unresolved traumatic attachment issues and the histories of maltreatment and neglect and the range of issues of that sets up for them when they want to have parent effectively anxiety is obviously going to one cared for me sometimes we see parents who are almost avoidant the whole situation is so art so I would see some young women who find it very hard to be with their babies as one young woman described to me recently I don 't want to get too close to my child because something bad could happen she couldn 't tell me what but she had a broad anxiety that things would go wrong and it might be that her baby wouldn 't like her but it also might be something about I could descend into an abreview create with my own child what happened to me and that phenomenon of recapitulation or reenactment of trauma from the past of the parent in the relationship with their child is probably one of the most common things that we see in a very distressing experience obviously for parents in child protection circles were obviously very familiar with the concept of repetition how powerful that is and look I think it 's sort of black humor isn 't it but many of us can think back to some of the happened to them with a child and you know we might see it happening in a terrible repetitive way this cycle of abuse and get quite overwhelmed by that but these are obviously all opportunities for us to put in place interventions but they 're understudied so if we think about the the young the very young we see traumatized infants and young children who have experienced a range of different interactions with carers from one extreme obviously we see direct and indirect maltreatment and abuse and we try and understand the developmental impact of that but we also in a more subtle ways see parents who are struggling in a day-to-day basis with providing consistent and available care parents who find it hard to see themselves as an attachment figure if you like our is a secure base and sometimes these are very important things to assess obviously in our evaluations we 're trying to understand what factors contribute to that ability to be there for the child to think about the child to be able to prioritize the needs of the child and importantly for us how does can be individual factors CLE really but they 're often social and community and cultural issues that contribute to high risk communities where there 's a breakdown of traditionally supportive care giving and caretaking functions so if I 'm working for example with the refugee population then there 's no way to look at child protection in those populations in isolation from their experiences of loss and grief and loss of home loss of culture and the impact that 's had on traditionally supportive and appropriate ways of managing children but sometimes in our in our area that gets miss because of a focus on risk to children so we don 't we have to get that balance right clearly we look at risk to children and look at intervention but we need to understand context and how the hell that comes about with these sorts of traumatic experiences early on whilst I 've stressed neurodevelopment are also going to affect psychological development that child who 's growing up in a dangerous and threatening environment where no one can understand and validate his or her experiences are going to have of what 's sometimes called reflective functioning or the ability to think of it and understand ourselves and other people in terms of mental states feelings wishes beliefs and to understand and regulate our emotions are some of the core aspects some of deficit of you like to use that were nor difficulty that we see in people who have experienced major abusive early years the other term bit of terminology that 's often used because we don 't have many better why is the thinking about it its attachment disorganization so many of the children that we see are going to have as I said those difficulties in understanding their internal States and putting words around them they 're going to have core difficulties in understanding that question that we all need to ask who is there for me I think we heard you know that they in the Welcome which was very powerful and moving children need to know that they 're loved they need to know who 's there for them communities that are functioning and healthy offer that to all children but children who 've grown fundamental and deep-seated anxiety about that basic question the availability of the attachment figure what we see behaviorally which think it 's diagnosed if they end up in a system often expressions of anxiety about that ways that children are desperately trying to get their attachment needs met and the strategies that they can try and use to signal their needs and to hopefully get some response but that 's very difficult if they don 't have the words to say it the emotional vocabulary that 's needed to engage with others and to regulate their own States so they 're going to have some of the core problems that we see in this reflective functioning in empathy or understanding others and these are the things that really shape and disrupt our ongoing functioning in a psychological and social way the abuse child grows up with contradictory and confused ideas about who they are and the availability of adults so one model that they might have very much says I 'm a good child and I really want to hang on to the idea that I 've had a loving ask an abused child to draw a family portrait and you 'll often get that idealized one initially the family all lined up in front of the beautiful house it looks like a ski chalet the sun 's shining the Ray bones in the sky everyone 's smiling the mum the dad whatever family members are there the pet dog of the pet cat and the child now I mean it is a very tragic when we think about the reality of some of these children 's lives but that 's really showing us that that child has that capacity to try and maintain an idealized notion of themselves I 'm a good child with a loving family mentally alongside that there 's another model which sadly might be more reality base which they are trying not to let intrude on their mental functioning but the model that says I am a bad child I 'm complicit in my own maltreatment I man I have done something to provoke my parents I 'm guilty and this is it often if we think developmentally forming the colonel if you like around a bad an unworthy charge and I can 't trust anyone now what children are try and do of course that we can all understand this is to keep those very separate and to maintain a more ideal izing picture but also not to think about the reality of the maltreatment this is a very important clinical point for those of you who do clinical work that abuse children are frequently putting a huge amount of psychological energy into not thinking about what is going on in the mind of the parent whether it was recent whether it was in the past and that 's a great struggle for all survivors of abuse and maltreatment to come to some sort of understanding of why why did it happen within an attachment theory framework we often work with those sorts of concepts to help people build up some level of understanding that firstly it wasn 't their fault I think that 's a very that can be very difficult but also that it can be thought about it 's not too it might seem incredibly overwhelming at times but it needs that it can be understood that there might be reasons now ultimately of course we might not know all the reasons why it happened to the abuse happened for this particular child but they need the child survivor needs a psychological model for understanding that not to say that they forget it or it 's a simplistic thing about I forgive everyone who is bad to me it 's not that it 's more I can live with the reality of it or what happened to me and I can understand it on some level I might not ever like it that makes something bearable and livable I think it 's important that when we think about our approaches that we think about well what does it all how do we operationalize some of these issues and what is it what do we aim at we set the standard if you like and we 're not sometimes talking to people about cure in a simple way we 're not saying we can help you forget all the badness that happen to and maybe it 's important that people have some of course that they 're going to repeat that we have to help people have a greater degree of understanding or reflective functioning around abusive experiences but in a way that enables them to be self-protective so they can enter into healthy relationships and a center like this if we look at the model has very much stressed that idea of building up the capacity for safety in relationships and productive relationships so this notion of attachment disorganization the way in which trauma early on usually at the hands of course of attachment figures disrupts and as an attack on attachment itself isn 't a put in important concept trauma also disrupts systems of meaning and thinking that 's also something that should oh that was lucky the gods are speaking to me that should also speak to our ways of working with people so we 're moving if you like from a system or an approach where we may be focused overly on getting people to repeat the details of trauma and abuse when maybe that 's not the focus the focus needs maybe meet to be more on move forward with something rather than get stuck with the notion of I 've been traumatized I will always be a trauma survivor as my only defining characteristic now that 's that 's controversial and people might have different views about that but we certainly want people who can acknowledge the reality of what 's happened to them to contribute in whatever way they wish to future activities which are about supporting others or preventing abuse but who recognize that they want in to a certain extent to be free of some of that history are not labeled entirely by it very difficult balance to get right and that 's a lot of discussion going on about that in the trauma survivor network as it should so we know a lot of it scene you 'll be familiar with this about maltreating parents that the issue I wanted to stress was the transgenerational issues the history of abuse and trauma and themselves obviously but how that sets up expectations about who the child is so a very important focus of this work is to help that parent acknowledge obviously that support around their own history but to help them free up the child if you like parents who are needy and emotionally deprived will often see the child as the one who 's going to make up for their all their own losses and an early emotional deprivation so the child becomes in the mind of the parent the one who 's going to be able to be their friend support them the perfect relationship that 's going to make up for all the difficulties that they 've had with other relationships now that 's some obviously well-intentioned if you like but it puts in an enormous pressure on the child and ultimately the child can 't_''_2337.009 be that for the parent so those dynamics of role reversal neediness the level on which if we 're doing therapeutic interventions we can actually work the other point and are aware of the time I 'll wrap up with with this but we need to think better about the way in which and understand better the way in which children present and think about our language and again this is an issue maybe moving away from some of the simplistic approaches to diagnosis of child disorders and trying to understand better within a trauma framework what that actually what the symptoms so-called actually mean so ADHD is probably a very good example of a diagnosis that 's used in my view excessively to describe a whole range of different things the way in which children with that so-called disorder present might well be quite valid I 'm not not to speak that what it mrs. is the notion of developmental pathways and factors contributing to those sort that sort of behavioral outcomes so when a child from a dysfunctional family goes to see clinician X and in 10 minutes has a diagnosis of ADHD I personally think that 's problematic because it 's decontextualized as a whole lot of the other work that we could be doing about parenting practices about abuse and maltreatment the aftermath of trauma gets missed so it 's an issue maybe of premature diagnosis or using diagnosis simplistically and it 's a wishful activity because people maybe have a deep-seated belief or a wish that if we right sadly we haven 't really done that over many years of ADHD that 's one example of course there are many and the things go in and out of fashion if you like we 've currently got epidemics of autism spectrum disorders must be something in the water is causing this it 's everywhere and a whole range of other can do I think we just have to be a little bit cautious and ask them again the simple questions why and what factors have contributed to this in the in this child so with traumatized children of course we can see a range of symptoms some of them are listed here we can see the way though in which that can affect which taught the way which trauma affects the child 's capacity to relate to others reenactment with peers the things that are deeply obviously deeply troubling about about children and the blows that trauma has meted for that 's child self-concept self representation as I mentioned before the child who feels guilty or complicit we know that children process and recall these regardless of age traumatic I can remain highly anxious and aroused and we can if we have the eyes to see it recognize some of the ongoing impacts of trauma what we see lamba generally and this is these are the issues we deal with in therapeutic ways ways in which children adapt or attempt to adapt to stress according to their developmental stage so what they can do at the time but that chronic stress the abused child essentially in a state of chronic unresolvable anxiety that 's going to have major developmental impacts on development and neurobiological functioning and if we get those basic principles and they are clear principles and trying to get them across in that way then that should inform our approach to the child a diagnostic approach if we think a child has been traumatized and has some of these features we can still use the PTSD label if we need to use a label for various purposes of documentation and health system functioning but we can formulate we can write down and think a very important that we note the story of the individual child in their contributed to it we can then move away from and this is that the final point I make we can move away from some of the more reductionist diagnoses that don 't help any of us necessarily understand and we can consider maybe some of the broader issues of attachment disorders of what we call attachment disorders talking about PTSD understanding disruptive behaviors in the context of what the child is trying to communicate to us why is a child who 's been abused drawn to abusive interactions why do they relate in that way what internal models do they have of how relationships work so bring that back to an attachment framework and looking for stress and from my perspective I think we can look at very early acute stress responses we need our systemic response in our clinical response to become more efficient and looking at some of the issues for the very young if we 're going to be serious about this whole idea of prevention we think about the vulnerability of children during these rapid periods of neurodevelopment and that 's where we should be getting some of their resources thank you very much _"

    "text": "can I invite now Minister gentlemen to the podium to say a few words well ladies and gentlemen it 's a great pleasure to be with you here this morning and firstly can I thank Richard for that fantastic welcome to country I really I think moving story and something we all need to take to heart can I also acknowledge the traditional custodians of the land we 're meeting on the normal people and I respect their continuing culture and the unique contribution they make to life in this area to Minister joy Burch welcome here this morning fantastic to see your work rolling out here and my assembly colleague Mary Porter Mary Porter and I have shared quite a bit of work together in regard to restorative justice for young people in the past to Natalie hausen director-general of Community Services Directorate to carry Heath principle of Dixon college and Dixon colleges of course Andrew bars I 'll college so great to be on his stomping ground to Professor Louise Newman and other experts in the field and of course welcome guests it 's with great pleasure that the trauma recovery center or melaleuca place a therapeutic service for a CT children and young people who have experienced trauma as a result of abuse and neglect melaleuca place is a targeted multidisciplinary holistic early intervention and prevention service committed to supporting children and young people to heal from trauma it also repairs existing relationships and establishes new supportive and protective networks the ICT government committed 3 million dollars from the 2013-14 budget over four years to establish the service as part of a commitment to protecting children from abuse and neglect childhood trauma is one of the nation 's most important health concerns with adverse ciao all the experiences being one of the strongest predictors for difficulties in life including physical and mental health problems so social and relationship problems and poor educational and vocational outcomes we 've read through the media recently testimony our victims at the Australian Australian Royal Commission into institutional response to sexual abuse and celebrity prosecutions of the devastating lasting impact of child abuse on individuals this service melaleuca place is a tangible response to intervening early to repair damage and to give happened to them we know from current research that many children involved in the child protection system are exposed to a number of situations early in life that increase their risk of experiencing not only trauma and disrupted attachments but also developing mental health problems by the time a child has entered the care system they may have already been exposed to multiple traumatic experiences including abuse neglect exposure to domestic violence a family history of mental health drug and alcohol abuse we therefore know that children in care display consistently higher rates of behavioral and other mental health problems as well as compromised cognitive and adaptive functioning than children in the general population the ability of a child in care to make sense of these traumatic experiences and develop meaningful relationships or attachments that Mayor system to overcome the trauma is hindered by their separation from family culture community peers and frequently school environments we also know that the brain is altered following prolonged exposure to trauma or stress and this can include permanent changes in brain structure and function these developments have conceded with the emergence of new with children and in particular focus on a child 's development age and the importance of building safe and secure your relationships as a means of recovery as a community we need to endeavor to prevent child abuse and neglect before it occurs the child and family centers in the acct another universal primary prevention and early intervention services focus on this goal in close partnership with our community partners and health colleagues however where abuse and neglect has occurred there 's growing evidence that intensive intervention as early as possible in the life of the child and in the development of the problem can help to temper the detrimental effects of abuse and neglect in essence there is need for early intervention in the tertiary system that is the prevention of further traumatic and harmful situations for the child who has already come to the attention of statutory authorities melaleuca place will provide a high quality trauma-informed therapeutic services to children in particular melaleuca place will facilitate healing recovery and positive life outcomes for children and young people recovering from abuse and neglect it will provide evidence informed intensive that assists other service providers and those who support the child in their family setting melaleuca place will work with established organizations such as Child and Family Centers the child at risk health unit the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service barnardo 's Mary Mead and the relevant community partners to give these children a chance to develop into happy and healthy adults not only does it take a village to raise a child it takes a supporting and informed village and melaleuca place will be the hub for this therapeutic village now ladies and gentlemen just before I conclude can I congratulate again Minister joy Burch on her hard work on the program to institute melaleuca place and I can I congratulate also their Directorate the staff and their passion for ensuring that in instances it 's the child that comes first I 'm really looking forward to working with them and their passion over these four years and in closing can I warmly welcome you all here today and I trust that you enjoy the opening as well as the symposium to follow thank you _"

    "text": "hi everyone so it 's great to be here I 'm going to change it up a little so to actually give you a bit of a deep dive into a company that lives and breathes the latest and what is on the edge of technology and the relevance is is that we 're taking as much advantage as we can of cloud technology so that we can actually make life better for the citizens of the world so you as consumers of government services or you as consumers of banking services or you know whatever it is and I 'm going to give you a bit of a deep dive into some of the stuff that we do for customers and we 'll try and kind of make that relevant to the cloud it 's a fair enough and so we are a camera-based global software company and if I can kind of segue from what Nina 's has just told us we 're a company in a very humble warehouse in the back of fish week that has clients all around the world so my guys who are three guys in Sydney two guys in Brisbane three guys in Singapore one in New York one in Dallas to in Toronto and the rest of us here in Canberra but these guys all participate in in the team as if you know we 're all together so we use a variety of technologies to enable our business to operate in that regard and skype kind of you know runs the world for us but there are some amazing emerging technologies that I 'm sure are going to become mainstream in the not-too-distant future and one of the pieces of equipment that we aspire to be able to afford is actually if you like a Dalek style of skype can you picture that so it 's a remote tele worker who is at their desk let 's call it dallas their face is on a Dalek style of mobile person in the home office it 's connected through the clouds they 've got a remote control of their desk and they literally drop think of a Dalek right you with me they literally so Dalek with a monitor on it your desk in fish we can see I can 't tap me on the shoulder they go whoo what are you working on right so it 's very cool so look out for that I 'm not the coach but they 're about ten thousand dollars a unit now so look it 's not long until this concept of presence and separateness is kind of irrelevant yeah and so bring it bring it on and all of this kind of cool stuff is enabled by the cloud enabled by stuff that just happens without you having to be anywhere or without anything having to be installed um so intelidox what what is it so 25 years in the making is is this company like i said a camera based company and essentially what we do is help our customers to turn what was once a paper-based workflow kind of process into a digital process so this is not scanning this is not digitization of kind of your records this is the digitalization of a business process one of the most exciting projects that we 've just finished is the complete of the asia-pacific 's largest banks so it 's not just the form yeah it 's not just that what 's your name you know how much do you earn what do you want to buy kind of thing this is the actual digitalization of the whole process so we take the customers data we collect it and then we take the bank 's process and the rules and all of the the kind of compliance and regulatory decision points that are made along the way and it 's completely digitalized so nobody touches it so all the function points and all the computation and all the decisions all the product options are all coded if you like into a workflow and a process so the world is moving towards less paper-based work flows into stuff happening online and if you think about our kids a few of us have made references to our very tech-savvy Connor 15 year olds is they expect everything to happen in that online experience yeah so by the time you get to step number seven they expect that the bank says yes or no week after some paperwork has been processed so I think that 's a really good ubiquitous example that I can give you that is the world that we live in so everything that we kind of do is leveraging cloud and in our context it 's actually the ability to leverage information and I 'm sure that my colleagues here and the panel would understand that so the deep dive if you like under the hood of cloud and why cloud is its ability to deal with volume of volumes of transactional data and information so if you kind of think about Netflix it 's the ability to store all that stuff and actually give bring it down a pipe to you without a career after bringing it to you and on a truck so what it 's enabling is cut some really stunning and amazing transformation in a way governments and large corporates will deal with US citizens so our company intelidox is a platform a technology platform that 's enabling governments and large organizations to bring you better online experiences I thought it 's very interesting Dean talking our own industry because if you like the enemy of innovation are the big kind of technology vendors that exist around the globe they are our friends indeed they have in our industry and they are very good people but they are protecting the legacy of a copper that they have in the ground and a lot of big corporations have vested millions and billions of dollars in those systems of the 80s and the 90s and so the next generation of cloud-based vendors and cloud-based service providers are disrupting and they 're really really challenging those paradigms of kind of big expensive projects that take a year or two or three to generally fail mind you you see them in the press if you a few in the press now where a certain very large very well-respected technology organization has surpassed a billion dollars worth of invoicing to the federal government here and we as citizens have nothing to show for that so they are paradigms of the past right so cloud and online is is truly going to transform the world for us as citizens our government will actually doesn 't work we what we kind of won 't_''_471.409 let them and so for us to intelidox we work in a cloud-based environment we have a whole bunch of our clients because we 've been in business for so long who are what we call enterprise clients who like things installed on their service so we deal with primarily government and so they are still the jury is still a bit out for them on cloud but I do believe that the tides of change are coming along quite rapidly we 've just convinced the the federal government that they can actually host a forum in the cloud so where the government can actually provide a link to you as a citizen to kind of just click on something and it will actually initiate a workflow where the government can interface with a citizen in a meaning in a meaningful way how often have you been sent in the mail some paperwork from the government so it 's a form if you think about it how often have you been sent something in the mail so on the postcode and all that kind of stuff you open up the envelope and there 's a form there that asking you what your name and your address your postcode is so a bit that 's what we 've lived through right that was kind of the way we do it so we are turning that kind of interaction between citizens and clients on their head we 've got about a million clients worldwide a million users of our technology and just last week we 're very excited to announce a major partnership with our company and Microsoft between Microsoft and fuji xerox so we 're using the Microsoft Azure cloud so it is a big beautiful kind of bunch of service in the sky and this is a singapore-based cloud and fuji xerox are rolling out our technology to their client base so for a little company in fyshwick it 's very very significant but if you think about this what does fuji xerox do it was a major kind of thing they print stuff right so what have I just told you that we do we don 't print Xerox is a major major major major company and if you stand back in any kind of CBD and look up at all the buildings you know 40 50 60 floors of offices every single one of those floors has probably about 20 30 40 50 printers on those floors now but at the end of a kind of a workflow or the end of a process someone goes over and presses print on a printer and so these guys are finally starting to understand that a process that needs an output doesn 't actually need something to go on to a bit of paper and and that 's kind of where we 're coming along with some disruptive technology and they and they get it and so working with one of the leading cloud vendors Microsoft we 're able to work together with an innovative is transformative disruptive piece of technology into a traditional kind of market leader that owns stuff that needs to be printed with a cloud vendor hopefully we 're going to see some changes in the marketplace and you know so we really are driving has has been ringing from people who want to access that stuff that used to be printed they want to start a workflow or start the engagement with that from a mobile we 've heard that from a couple of the presenters today and like we know with the next generation they want to do stuff on their own time and their own terms so they want to be able to pause you know something in the middle of what they 're doing and come back later and so cloud technology enables us to do that to take advantage of that kind of stuff everything 's digital and everything is it is about data I think I think that 's really what i 'm trying to say everything is about data knowing where that data is knowing what that data is called getting that data back when you need it and making sure that data is secure so the market is in a bin a phase at the moment where it can be uncertain about the security of data and look that could be a whole three day conference that 's very interesting Wow gosh time goes too quickly okay so what I 'm saying is the demand is hot yeah everyone 's ringing saying how can I put stuff online how can I do this workflow smart online now one of the beautiful things is here in Canberra right we 're talking about digital camera I 'm talking about smart stuff is that we are a resource poor city yeah we haven 't got hundreds and thousands of workers who can come in and 20 people can kind of handle the processing of a bank loan application in the bank rate Singapore Hong Kong China they got no problems with productivity yeah with employing all of you to come and process that home loan application that the customer just left behind you 'll check something 's right and then pass it to your colleague he 'll do something else right that 's a workflow what we 're seeing is that the stuff that 's coming out of Canberra is well plus because we have to be lean we have to be smart we don 't want to handle something the first time we want to make sure that the rules are hardwired in there somewhere and that a human hasn 't had to kind of randomly apply what they think they know about processing a home loan applications so my point is is that the stuff that 's coming out of the smart companies in this city is world class yeah it really is because of the kind of the environment that we live in so the other guys have already talked about this kind of stuff so we 'll go go past that are choosing cloud is is really good for business and we 've talked about these kind of things about scalability and you know you don 't have to pay an IT guy to do your upgrades and things like that we 've all heard about mild going to the cloud and we 've all heard about a fabulous start up from New Zealand called zero who 's really challenging my on some of the things we haven 't talked about our multi-tenancy and data sovereignty so there 's a kind of terminal terminology that you us to enable our technology to have a greater uptake in the market we 've had to create a software-as-a-service version of our technology make it a multi-tenancy so it 's kind of like building a high-rise apartment out of our software so that anybody can come along and take an apartment in our high rise good analogy because if you think about it we 've been a software company forever and ever and our clients are used to us having their own apart their own house kind of thing that all has to be serviced separately data sovereignty is a very very big issue for some software service software providers who are providing there there are services globally because you are bound to the laws of the country in which your service is consumed and there 's all kinds of experiments if you 're like going on with that and it 's definitely something the industry is needs to deal with I 've got a few links here how about I just take one just the bottom one Greg and this so I commend that them these articles to transformative nature of what technology and digital can do for you and your business either you as a citizen in the world or you as a user of technology or you and your business how you can innovate using technology so PricewaterhouseCoopers it 's a the digital pulse here I 'm into disruption on those of you who know me know that unreasonably disruptive kind of person but this is really cool just go down Greg this is super cool this is a really cool kind of info graphic I wonder if you can see it but in the context of what cloud is going to do for all of us this this is a really good way of bringing at home Roger you said you wanted me to anchor it and bring it home if you can see this and Gartner 's doing some really good work around this if you just kind of Google the Internet of Things you 'll see so using this great kind of cloud technology and stuff that 's emerging now you can blend the weather report yeah so what 's going to happen data of traffic volumes or traffic flow combine that with the public transport system so say like the train system and what cities are going to be able to do is to determine the optimal time for you to kind of be a public transport user on a wet weather day and and that your tram or your or your bus is actually going to be where you need to be when that downpour comes along so makes sense right so you 're blending weather data with traffic kind of lights and that 's all data it 's all information trend analysis and then Bing the systems of the city are all going to be connected to make you make our lives as citizens you know a great life and there 's some really really wonderful examples that you can see if you if you follow some of these links if you just google the Internet of Things if you want a bit of a mind-blowing kind of experience you can see why you need to get on board with cloud why you need to understand it and brace it for it that 's just a kind of a citizen type of example but you think about you think about the kind of medical technology you know the advances in in what doctors and hospitals can do with this kind of really smart technology get you get you better quicker medical research and that kind of stuff so I think as you could probably predict I could talk about this underwater in concrete forever I hope it 's given you a little bit of an insight into kind of you know the world of someone that lives in the clouds and I 'll hand it back to you roadshow to wrap it up okay thank you you _"

    "text": "type now because you might later okay thank you very much for inviting in front along tonight I think I 've got one of the most exciting and confusing topics of IT at the moment that is the cloud the clouds one of those terms that gets bandied around a bit a lot a lot in marketing a lot in the industry maybe a lot by your kids the fact is is and we honestly believe this at in front and it 's certainly what we 're what we 're seeing in the industry at the right from the enterprise level is that the cloud is without a doubt the most Titanic change I don 't mean that sinking wise monumental ship my most monumental change in the way I t will be provisioned since the advent of the internet and the reason I say this is because what the cloud really is is the second wave of the internet the benefits of the internet are going to be realized possibly for the first time to their fullest extent the first wave when internet first came about was quite a selling from the internet it really changed the way in which business needed to be executed from an ICT perspective a provider perspective it was fantastic this was a great opportunity for us to do more implementations different implementations this second wave of of the internet which is the cloud has really reversed that from an ITC provider ICT provider perspective it 's really disrupting the way in which traditional IT providers are now going to have to provide their service but from a business perspective suddenly the second wave is the opportunity for for businesses to do things differently and from my perspective small to medium enterprise and I take medium enterprise up to a thousand people I don 't know what medium enterprise is properly to find it but I 'm talking to 3,000 people these enterprises the smaller you are the more likely it is that you can take advantage of the cloud larger organizations are struggling to move to this new agile model because if incumbent incumbent ice-t processes procedures and people in culture so let 's have a look a little bit more what the probably make tonight the cloud is not a technology or product but an operating model the cloud is fundamentally changing the way in which businesses are going to consume IT in the past you bought a server perhaps put it in your server room you 've got IT staff that came around and supported supported your business that operating model is a dying model and this is why it 's threatening their ICT providers but is an opportunity for for business so let 's have a look at the next next slide here where I I 'll explain what that model looks like any cloud service and the cloud operating model has some common features they may not have all these features and they may may not have them all to their full extent but it is a self-service consumption model it 's not a build model you don 't build the service you choose to consume it and generally consumed it at your own discretion it 's a pay as you use model it 's either a subscription model where I subscribe to this for a period of time it 's flexible in the past if I built a server or bought a product be at my office productivity or my finance product that I had inside I was very much held to that product for the period of time that I that I had it till i thought that i got to return on investment under the new model i can move between products and providers flexibly it 's device-independent i consume this service no longer from jess my pc but for many different devices and last one is inherently because i can i have disconnected that application or this service from how its consumed on the device it is quite often but not always inherently mobile I can get it from anywhere so the classic example of this is if we didn 't live in Australia we had more choice than Foxtel here we 've got some streaming media I could choose to self-service consumed from netflix I sign up to netflix I didn 't have to build anything I didn 't have to buy a DVD i can pay either a subscription for the month and I can choose then to change over to watch it on youtube or on hulu or somewhere else it 's device-independent i can watch it on any device may enable TV my desktop and it 's mobile I can watch it anywhere so this is why streaming media is truly a cloud service so once we 've got it in our heads that cloud is not a product but a way of consuming traditional services then cloud starts to make a lot more sense when you start hearing it in the media or start seeing it in the marketing if it doesn 't do this and there are plenty of people who are getting traditional products and doing what we call cloud washing them then then you should be able to identify the difference so you 're all using the cloud today or at least your kids are now if we have a look over here on the left these are all models of cloud that certainly are my children even at ten are using some of them but many people are familiar with itunes Facebook a bit of a in the office and this is very much a conversation that we have had in our office between two hours our senior staff within two years the way in which we 're consuming IT is changing that rapidly that even in the ICT industry we 're struggling to keep up with a new model in a new way of doing things I explained cloud today to our 15 year old work experience kid today and it was very very interesting he didn 't see this is innovative at all he only understood this is the model and when I said what about installing a piece of software and he said that 's old-fashioned so this is really changing quite rapidly we 're already using cloud services but as I 'll explain later many of these services that we 're consuming now have some of the challenges that are yet to be addressed within the cloud space so what does clouds what the cloud services look like well there 's really three big flavors there 's infrastructure as a service you may hear especially from people like Amazon Microsoft Google VMware in my server room I want a virtual server that sits out on the internet or off-site and I can install software on it and manages it as if it was in my organization now this service here is more than just providing a virtual machine you can choose to protect it back it up recover it you can do other other things with it but it 's a reasonably unsophisticated cloud offering the other offering in one that you may all be already familiar with this platform as a service the most common platform that small to medium enterprises that are like to have seen so far our web services if you 're got a cup if you have a company that are hosting your web web site in your web environment that is a classic platform as a service in people who have use that really get to understand the advantage of not having to run the server 's not having to keep them up to date but push that out as a service but the really exciting space is the one on the on the far side Store have a thousands and thousands tens of thousands hundreds of thousands applications but what we 're finding now our traditional desktop suppliers of service Adobe Microsoft my OBE you name it these are companies that means small to medium enterprises will will be very familiar with are now starting to transform and offer their traditional desktop services as a cloud service consume subscribe flexible access from anywhere and in fact people like Adobe are starting to de-emphasize the desktop product and this is something that we all need to be aware of if you 've got a application in your environment that 's critical to your business and that vendor does not have a very we plan to move that product to a cloud service I would ask that you seriously look at alternatives for that product because this model over here at the moment is an option moving to software as a service in a subscription model is an option I wouldn 't say that within the next two years that this becomes the only way for many products that you 're going to be able to consume fantastic service and it 's going to give you a lot of choice but you really need to be prepared for it so why would you go cloud let 's look at the real business benefits to pay for use I 've been in the IT industry about 18 years and I couldn 't tell you how many times people go well I better buy 20 licenses for this in case I get more stuff on and if leave I 'm stuck with that asset or need to buy this we now have an opportunity to scale up and scale down the licensing based on your per user choir- Scapa ttle and operational expenditure I know now no longer need to bring in those IT staff to look after that server that I hope to god is being backed up with my critical business data both of those top two advantages bring the third which is predictable IT spend when you are buying on a subscription you were better able to plan as you grow and shrink within your organization to understand what your IT band will be self service nature of your ICT staff you don 't know how long it 's going to take when you want an application for someone to provide it to you here 's an opportunity in a controlled manner within correctly deployed cloud to control the way in which your own staff can just ask for services that you 've allowed them to get and the last one is agile software and service offerings hundreds of thousands of applications that you can move between best-of-breed now that that that actual process is something that is evolving in the cloud industry moving between services and we 'll talk a little bit later about vendor lock-in but all those advantages of a cloud service operating model give you more agility than have ever had before to meet changing business requirements without having to bet against the future or react slowly when things change so should you go to the cloud or shouldn 't you that 's it look there 's a lot of great benefits to the cloud but it 's important that you proceed carefully what I tell you about cloud today may be vendors are fighting it out in a battle right now bringing more and more services and enriching their services so rapidly it 's very hard to keep up and you need to be constantly watching what 's happening so before moving to the cloud and this is critical which cloud services are right for my business and the only way you will ever understand that is if you understand how your business uses IT I 've seen plenty of organizations run into the cloud thinking it 's a great idea getting caught up with it without an understanding what their business really needs needs from the cloud and how does that align to existing services once I find a cloud service it seems to match what my business needs I need to understand what the real cost benefits are amazon for example wonderful company massive company they 've got many many processes to ingest your data into their organization and not too many to leave and then when you similar to a mobile phone plan you can get a bit of bill shock so understanding how your business is going once you 've decided this particular service or all my services need to go to the cloud one of the things that cloud providers particularly do badly is help you get there let 's say thank you for the credit card and start building your monthly or how do I get all my data up there or how do I start to use this system thanks for the credit card and that this is an unfortunate era we are in cloud but it 's getting better and how will I manage it once you 've got some of your services or oil services up in the cloud it is a changed operating model and so traditional IT support teams and also traditional ways in which you view your IT have changed so understanding how that works three more minutes okay geez I better better speed along okay so this is a sort of assessment that you might do against one of your services besides a finance system that I have inside same old considerations different challenges you should be sitting asking yourself many of these same questions about any service if it 's going to be up on the cloud I need to make sure that my entire business value which might be in my data for my users is going to be maintained security or authentication I certainly don 't want to log on 20 to 20 different systems I log on to this for HR and I log on to this for for backup and I log on to this to get my file single sign on is very important in a very big challenge within cloud service level agreements I want to make sure this this is critical to my businesses that these people are going to keep the system going how does it integrate with my existing desktop products connectivity and cloud is king but because your mobile if my business connection goes down I can be at home I can be at work everyone I don 't bother coming in today Internet 's down buildings burnt just all work from home your business continuity plan becomes both enriched and threatened by a cloud offering not it 's not a problem is this is all about you can check out anytime you want but you can never leave there are plenty of cloud providers are a little bit like that and the last one is the changing ICT management landscape which I mentioned so don 't make that your cloud strategy do not have someone ring you up or do not sign up to something that you do not understand in cloud and certainly don 't move your data up there go in with your eyes open because you get a monthly bill and it 's just like my kids are on a mobile phone bill shock can happen but cloud is so powerful in fact it 's the only way of the future and its small to medium Erica as a smaller you are the more likely it is that one or two providers like office 365 great proponent of it if you 've got Microsoft in your organization you got a real license do not go with anything other than 365 because you can stay on your traditional model until you 're ready to move but make sure you go in with your eyes advice one thing that we like about in front is we don 't sell any cloud services at all so we do we 've got no vested interest but i can guarantee any cloud provider that comes to you where you haven 't_''_952.12 got that independent advice first is going to think that you 're all good match for everything that they sell second assess your service of the cloud understand what you need and really understand those those those points are pointed out the cost benefits for each service and the last one and this is critical engage IT support that understands cloud if you 're good a traditional IT support company that doesn 't get this story then their vested interest is keeping you exactly where you are because remember I said why the beginning this is a threat to ICT it 's a threat to every business you know and so unless you they 're going to evolve with you you 're going to have some problems look clouds are massive topic lots to cover I know I 've lasted through that but hopefully now you 've a consumption model that 's a great opportunity for small to medium enterprise the best opportunity for small to medium enterprise and I think and I think many many organizations within the next two years will almost purely be working on cloud so hopefully that was helpful thank you very much _"

    "text": "thank you very much good evening my name 's Andrew Donahue I 'm the managing director of blue packets i 'm here to see we talk about managed services and the cloud I 'll quickly cover what I 'm going to run through so now 's your chance to go to the toilet first of all lose presentation be useful for you what are managed services about trusted configurations and a system life cycles a quick introduction to cloud computing about cloud computing and managed services getting to the cloud and your systems in the cloud first things first should you be watching this presentation if you need your IT systems to be working the answer is yes going back 10 15 years ago IIT could be down for half an hour or an hour life went on you go on the paperwork shuffle things around now your paperwork is your IT system if it stops everything inside your organization is probably going to stop with it there are a few exceptions to this I should note there are some people who can get away without their IT for half less and less as time progresses next thing what I managed services think of these as a systematic approach to delivering IT servicing it varies greatly from the paper our model that a lot of you might be used to so instead of having someone come out for an hour block or two hour block or five hour block to deliver services it 's based on an outcome so that means the provider can deliver the service in the most efficient manner as mentioned offer under managed services specific tasks are undertaken for a set price this means things like backup testing security updates hardware health checks if you got hardware on site reporting monitoring and general management and perhaps some reactive servicing is bundled in with that price there 's an efficiency dividend here this means the provider can provide the outcome in the most efficient way possible they don 't get tied up in red tape asking you for permission to spend five more minutes solving a task they go and solve the task of a problem selves that way next month of the problem doesn 't exist faster outcome it also helps old bill shock too which is a big one and this comes down to the also thinking of fix it when it breaks is no longer good enough now get my car service to every 10,000 case or so yes the mechanic makes money Adam along the way but my cars never broken down I hope it doesn 't it provides greater up time for me it 's there when I need it and I don 't have any nasty things like the oil running out and downtime because the car 's not working it 's a bit of a leap frog but talking about trusted configurations so if your ICT provider is giving you advice about what hardware to use and you still there devices this applies to both on-premise and off premises in the cloud devices it 's important to listen to them if they 're giving good advice about how you can eat what you purchase to get to the cloud there are different devices are very expensive some are cheap the cheaper option is always attractive often the cheaper options can expensive to manage so while you must have a few dollars right now over the life of the product or the life of the service will probably cost you a lot more the next question is what to manage because managed service has come at a price so you may have dozens of systems lying around and you might have one it 's only used by a few staff the simple answer to that is if you can 't afford to break them manage it it 's going to be too costly to manage consolidate move it on there 's a whole bunch of options out there for you if it 's a server or a device running in the corner that only a few staff could use can 't afford to turn it off then something 's wrong you can either turn it off or you need to look after it if it 's not worth managing as I said get rid of it everything will eventually fail so if you 're just waiting up to break you 're waiting on disaster you 're better off dealing with it a bit faster cleaning out your temporary files growing security updates making sure the experience as a whole is a nice one the problem is you can get this illusion that your system is going to run forever so yes the provides a great job things are working things are working things are working years later things are still working there is a point there where software updates maintenance and general IT support cannot make that device work forever well this is to work forever presume some time is going to fail don 't wait until it 's time to fail get in early plan ahead even if you don 't execute that plan for two or three years have that plan ready so when you decide you decide to move on your terms and it 's not a rush decision because rushed decisions will cost you a lot of money cloud computing besides a fancy marketing term perhaps a simple square can describe it is a resource that is used outside of your network so something your company doesn 't own operate it 's an IT service provided by email arm anti-spam antivirus scanning off-site backup we go all the way through to a complete managed virtual server or software as a service where your application is delivered to you as a finalized product and this is where the type of service becomes very important if it 's a raw service or said like a virtual server who are checking your backup and system status who is running security updates who is going through making sure the latest version of software within that virtual service he 's applied who is looking after the integration and general support it 's working great it breaks who do you call and give a way to manage the cloud services efficiently so you might have one two three four different cloud providers there might be application for the user virtual server there if you have a new stuff input a start do you have to add accounts in all those places who ties it all together how much time you spend adding a user account beyond premise wealth has done it quite well now in most cases if you have everything in sight minutes if you have multiple cloud providers how long is the same thing going to take I should step 11 be back that 's where the value of a managed provider comes in with a cloud is actually taking that step and helping you manage part of that process so instead of you being on your own and trying to get to the cloud and managed it a managed service provider should be able to tie it all in for you nicely and it was not nice and it should be able to manage the process for you document it and be able to actually request on your behalf so you 've got the cloud it 's outside your office you still need to have an on-site network I 'll come back to reliability about this is it fast enough there 's no point having this greatest amount in the cloud it 's outside of your network if you 're stuck on a picture from last century it 's got to be fast that does cost it 's got to be congestion free you want something fast it 's going and pieces coming out there still is latency to cook the pipe that gets between your business and the outside world is still relatively small that will improve over time but it will take time what happens when the internet goes down if your network is heavily reliant on a very fast connection you may be in trouble internet failure still happen it almost it might be not in common but you can see half a day to a day of outage per year if you take 2 5 10 minute 15 minute one hour blocks put together if you 're a line I 'll eat it to be functioning for this that 's quite a serious disruption to your time so if you imagine a office full of people who are doing billable work and you take the daily the hourly rate times a by a day you 're going to lose one day that per year that 's quite a hit and quite an expense and make sure you 've got a plan in place so when it does go down you can get back up and running don 't have to run back home other phones cloud-based are they going to work still once the internet goes down and make sure you test it importantly if you have been house servers your data is on the server they want to be backed up properly no you 're going to make sure if someone 's looking after it but you can see it it 's physically there as long as you 're building doesn 't burn down should be okay if your data everything 's in the cloud it might be hundreds of kilometers or even thousands of kilometers away so you go to make sure you back that up if you have multiple cloud providers it is worth engaging a separate cloud provider to back up your data I kind of beat river and I 'll see but we lost our data and our systems would be in serious trouble it is worth collecting that data like it is your lifeline and without it you 'll be in serious trouble so make sure you 've got a plan to back it up make sure it is being be dealt with I say it 's a very low likelihood but the impact is massive so it means you gotta deal with a risk so in summary if you need those systems to be working make sure you manage them don 't ignore it the cloud services and cloud offerings are a great opportunity for everyone both terms efficiency and cost reduction and risks exists both on-site and off-premise by putting your systems into the cloud you don 't reduce that risk it 's still a risk that 's gotta be managed so make sure you look after it that 's that 's it _"

    "text": "yeah that really is a great question and I think people come at this this changing world of work with a whole range of different perspectives and from a range of different experiences and it would be great to know what we have in the room in terms of where people are at with with remote work is anyone has anyone had a bit of experience working from home or working from the co-working Center I think about half of the room is anyone managing store can you you can 't hear me that well okay um if anyone managing workers who work from home or work from a co-working Center yeah brilliant and been doing that for a while or yes yeah yep okay Stream overalls or thinking about managing staff from from remote locations anyone in that boat not quite but thank you that is that is great to note so we have a lot of people who are experienced practitioners in the room who have done the kind of work from home themselves but really when we 're thinking about what can business off what can business all about how it looks as a as a manager or as a leader and how do we build that into our business and so that we can really benefit from that and it 's it 's quite a different story from that side so let 's have a look at some of the things to consider firstly the the massive growth in remote work and in mobile work has surprised even the predictors so the International Data Corporation is an organization that predicts all kinds of things around digital economy one of them is mobile work and they 've had to revise their earlier prediction of 1.2 billion mobile workers up to 1.3 mobile workers by 2015 because the numbers were growing even five expected so but just how prevalent is that here in Australia it is really quite prevalent so we see that already fifty-one_,_138.44 percent of employees in Australia using the Internet 's to work away from the office and half of those are working two days per week equivalent of two days per week in their hours outside the office so that means that you know a good chance that at least one of them is working at least two days a week at home using the internet and so it 's it 's really very prevalent and and sometimes enabled by cloud other times just email and phone but cloud is really where there 's a lot more potential to increase the the power of remote work and work from anywhere and I think that that comment that Dean made about cloud but just being so powerful I really see that in this space factor one of the best ways to kind of understand what remote work offers a business as opposed to what traditional work offers a business is I think the difference between kind of a jet plane aeroplane versus a car so the car will kind of get you there but as soon as we realize that a plane is going to be faster more powerful more direct in fact it will get us there you know so much faster that 's the mode that people are preferring so it 's increasingly becoming mainstream the car is kind of becoming you know 're finding there 's a whole range of different ways that we 're trying to talk about this shift telework is one of them just one of them mobile work working from home flexible work hot desking activity-based work telecommuting young you 'll hear all kinds of things and really I might use just a range of those terms in this presentation today to talk about work that breaks free of that traditional model of 00 to 00 in the office and has a new flexibility so I think we haven 't really decided on one term so it 's hard to kind of to give one term but I think probably remote work captures it this so the question is how can your how can your business capitalize on this emerging norm and there 's a new flexibility not just around where the work takes place but also when it takes place and how that work is going to get done and we 'll talk a little bit more at the end of the presentation I 'll give a few kind of stellar examples of companies in Australia that from work from home but but initially every company has a set of fears around how they 're going to do this this is kind of the the archetypal kind of managerial concept of what we think work from home is about he 's working from home he 's got his laptop he 's working right know he 's admitting to his friend actually not at all watching TV got the computer down the other side not working at all and this really is the predominant fear that managers have that some organizations have but that remote work is really just a fantastic excuse to to get away for their employees to get away with with doing nothing at all in fact we see that the opposite is the case and the research consistently shows that I don 't know if anyone was watching a show on the weekend Osby is Asia there was a really large investment banking firm interviewed and and they again their representative there was saying that they consistently see that people who are offered flexible work options give more back to the company and and with flexible work that is remote work so work from home can can consistently achieve productivity gains of at least 20% and that 's that 's not an exaggeration so that 's equivalent to if you 've got a full-time worker working five days twenty percent is the equivalent of been working an extra day for your company in terms of the outcomes that they achieve so three main fears our work won 't get done also that the quality of interactions between remote workers and colleagues will diminish and that workers are more unsafe doing this kind of work so let 's have a look at how all of these legitimate fears can be addressed and I should perhaps give you a little bit of a background to where I can talk to this topic as well and I spent a couple of years working in the national in the federal government here leaving the national initiative to increase telework in Australia it 's part of the digital economy strategy fantastic window into what some of our industry partners were doing and how they 're doing this effectively we a you we were giving people information about it and it was really for me a kind of deep introduction into the issues and the challenges that businesses face so so happy to kind of continue the conversation with you about that as well but this is a very quick overview just gives you some of the things to think about some of the the major things that are a concern so how to address it essentially these are a quick kind of snapshot of the things that you would need to look at your business its activities and your own weather your workers suit telework the need to train managers the need to consider telework in innovation and to consider adjusting your work environment as well to really take advantage of the the productivity benefits that are available so we 'll have a look at all of these I 've gone through the literature and I 've looked at businesses that are around and doing this successfully and it 's possible we 've done this as a team at telework article it 's possible really to to distill these has these in place and the academic literature supports it quite strongly leadership is essential so the the change that 's happening in an organization is is significant leadership is just as important as it is in any other change program but it also is important because managers need upskilling and and because it 's quite new and different people are really in need of direction and clarity so leadership is absolutely essential a willingness to innovate to treat telework as an innovation it is a workplace innovation it 's a different way of doing things and there 's ways that we handle that so we look at new trialing piloting assessing doing it in an agile flexible kind of ways that 's important to to treat the shift to work from home in that same way as an end as a learning process having a suitable workforce usually just means knowledge workers team members are not excluded so team workers is not excluded from our work and in fact some remote work teams can be some of the highest performing teams in in businesses manager training this is just work it 's just an essential there 's there 's a fair amount that men just need to do to upskill and I 'll go into that shortly a general level of flexibility in the company like some more workplaces have flexible work policies it just kind of goes together capacity to measure performance against outcomes so this is a really important midway step between having absolute trust in someone and completely losing control so it 's it 's more more than the trust end but it 's it 's the important midway step where an organization looks at results and decides to measure that on and on perhaps on a less frequent basis but they support an up skill they 're their team members to to do that work and then planning so planning is just really important not least because you 've got to have the right technology you 've got to be able to decide when people are having meetings when are we going to do this face to face when are we not but it 's it 's important in a lot of different ways so suit telework we 've got just a snapshot they 're professional scientific technical roles information media and telecommunications finance and insurance administration support so these are kind of a a general description it 's essentially knowledge work work that can be done at the desk can probably be done at a desk at that person 's home with the right technology in the right management in place a point that I make is if your goal is to improve productivity across the organization and it really is important to to do to implement telework across the organization so there 's this research and there are reasons behind that but that is the the those organizations get the best results when they make it possible for anyone to telework and then they allow people to opt in as opposed to telling them that they must remote work so that is the best way to do it but you also need to have manager training and a trial with each employee so not just a trial with an area but a child of each employee and make the point as well that this that the technology just hasn 't got to the point yet where it 's really going to replace face-to-face most of the time so in fact part time kind of achieves a balance of contact face-to-face and work from home and it 's probably the best place to start to start trying to you know it see what what is the best arrangement in your organization so it 's important just to think about how managers do this they have a lot to do they have a have a fairly significant load to bear and so this is these are just a few things that really stand out in and what a manager 's job is is now about clearly articulating the results that are deded rather than monitoring a person 's activity at their desk and that does require beautiful wood thinking and thinking what is this person 's job about what what can i assess about this work when are we going to check in on the progress and the outcomes and how am I going to describe not just the work that needs to be done I 'm saying don 't do it like this but doing like that that 's important to the organization that represents culture values those kind of conversations so written performance plans become very important as to kind of weekly updates and check again reports and the manager 's job becomes less about monitoring and more about leadership and empowerment coaching thank you great so even though there is a fair amount tubbs a fair amount of upskilling to do managers can have happier more engaged teams workers love the opportunity to do remote work and there there is plenty of evidence that people will will seek that out will they 'll seek out a flexible work arrangement they 'll seek out a remote work arrangement if they can find one but the demand far exceeds the supply at the moment so if you offer remote work in your organization you really have a fantastic opportunity to attract the best and brightest so this is just a few more of the things that managers need to do provide certainty around the team 's mission so that 's where leadership is coming email shouldn 't be the primary mode of technology of communication maintaining that social contact is essential some organizations will just make a call every week you know hello this is just a social chat how are you going it 's the dog six still making an effort to keep employees in the loop so social networking can be fantastic for that if they weren 't there for the birthday cake at least they see a photo on Facebook about it and keeping communication open and steady between staff is really important as well so there 's with that point about the technology that I made there is that this is kind of the ideal placement if you like for these technologies so there 's if you think about communication as a complex task and some communication is very complex and others other communication is not so complex and we have a lot of information that we 're trying to get there person 's facial expression their their intention their you know the context and so email doesn 't give you much information shouldn 't be used for complex communication 's almost just like you and I meeting face to face except I can 't actually hand you that glass of water that you that you need if you 're you 're coughing but yeah it 's for complex communication negotiations liaison you know team brainstorming stuff like that that 's your ideal gives you the most amount of information and then it 's worth mentioning mobile devices enabled by the cloud these social collaboration tools that are possible now Skype is becoming one of them where you can share your screen etc and virtual private networks are one of the ways that people manage this securely because they provide a great high performance security secure network so the last area is your physical work environment just to mention WHS because I raised that as a as a fear that people have the government 's advice on this is to know what your what the legislature or what the regulator in your state if what their advice what their advice is so but that and that doesn 't give you much more than just kind of having to read through company called work pro that i 'm aware of it 's an e-book it 's a free download it 's fully legally compliant and it gives you all step by step how to manage the WHS so some businesses are reaping the rewards and what you don 't see here are the logos of the companies and due to perhaps due to short us the time I won 't go through what all of these benefits are but their productivity attraction and retention of staff saving costs so they 're companies like Westpac Medibank a be seen National Australia Bank large companies in Australia and the question now for us is as work has become a place not a place to go but a thing that we do how are we going to adapt to this new powerful work mode that really is taking over in terms of the way that that work happens in mainstream works so I 'll leave you with that thought thank you _"

    "text": "thanks very much for your time tonight and I appreciate being invited up to speak to you about this topic to someone that 's very close to our how-to video is a branding and digital agency based in Canberra and for us user interface design is kind of caught or two what makes a good website a good website basically and it 's a really big topic so I 'm going to try to whiz through it and I 've missed out lots of stuff but we 'll just see how we go so what is your idea it 's it 's something that 's often shortened down to user interface design is shutting down quite offer duid another thing are you going to hear a lot about is you x which is user experience our personal opinion is that the two are so heavily intertwined but it 's at technically speaking user interface design is the design of websites routes with focus centered on the user experience coupled with an understanding of actions or goals that we want to use it to make and that 's really the key of a website when I 'm really kind of crafting someone 's experience online we need to we need to really be able to understand what the user wants we need to understand what we want to do put the do together and that kind of turns into uid it 's a critical component of making a truly effective website or app and to kind of extend on that it 's actually a really effective element of making a really critical component of making an effective and anything that a user needs to interact with I 'm talking physical stuff as well as software stuff and that this is still designed by by someone that needs to kind of is still interface that I need to to explore and if it 's been poorly designed it 's going to be hard for me to work it out and so your idea and UX are best friends this is my personal the technical kind of definition of it isn 't quite that but without really understanding how the experience and the design mixed together how can we possibly expect users to expect to make a website that is going to engage people and get them to do what we want them to do the experience is intrinsic to the design they can 't_''_136.22 be separated and so for us I 'm kind of pitching to you that from now on call them the same thing why is it important because the information landscape is really crowded there 's more websites than ever before every day we compounded by information people want our attention all of the time people 's attention span is now measured in seconds online in fact we have internally what we call an eight second rule on websites that 's measured by the bounce rate across all the websites that we currently manage about 400 and something sites currently internally that we manage on a regular basis on a daily basis we monitor them bounce rate has reduced year-on-year by about one and a half seconds a year we 're sitting about eight seconds now ie if people don 't find what they 're looking for within eight seconds of getting to your home page or the landing your user experience if your new ID or user interface design isn 't something that 's engaging them in eight seconds yourlust them it 's important it 's really important in fact it 's kind of critical to your online success so what 's involved and I 've tried to break it down into kind of some of the steps that we do this actually heaps more involved but I 'm not sure if I can cover them all so I 'm just going to cover the bits and pieces that we 're going to get through some of the specifics step 1 know what you want and what your user wants and stick them to both together this is really really important your goal should be you users goals and vice versa we need to understand clearly how many clients come to us i can 't tell you a bit it that comment sort of so i went in a website we need to kind of do this we kind of have this wishy washy sort of idea of the type of goal that we 're trying to get trying to get and the website has to cater to all of them equally we can 't piss off the CEO we can piss off the CFO ricard pissed off this guy but they just make it do everything really really well in eight seconds it 's impossible so we need to clearly understand and okay can you articulate to me what your site has to do like really clearly and do you can you clearly tell me what you user once can you actually just tell me what does your typical customer one if you can 't answer those questions that 's the first step of this process let 's sit down and research it let 's have in one-on-one interview call your client call your stakeholder and say hey how do you want to engage with me in the best way what 's the fastest way that we can make this happen what 's the easiest way to make this happen you 'll be surprised at the answers that you get your users are very intelligent there 's been this weird misnomer that 's been pushed down people stupid well the consumer is you and me and all of us we are consumers they 're not stupid we 're highly intelligent very skeptical of most like dodgy scammy sort of stuff they 're not going to jump through hoops i 'm going to download your free report to get the free thing to do though unless they feel there 's genuine value there these are all things that we know because we do it all the time and yet we don 't follow through on so you really need to understand your user that 's your so step and you got to know clearly who you are step 2 the web is full of patterns and it 's usually better not to reinvent the wheel and to suggest to say that talking about some of this stuff design conventions are kind of informal rules that have just appeared over time they 're just kind of happened someone had to invent the wheel at some point fair enough but what has happened is that people have seen that that 's worked and then kind of stuck with it and exist all the time most people I think will get what that means what gains or what the little gear icon means or because you 've seen it before you know what that means you 've seen this even though this is insanity in my opinion but you know what that is now that we call that the hamburger menu but it 's it 's a button to get you to a many of do most people recognize that straight away it 's something that just come up because i think my gut instinct is that someone drew it on a wireframe one day and said I there 's we need a button that will take people to a menu well that 's the shortest and smallest way that I can explain what a menu look like from really far away presume at that 's it so but these become design conventions so when you 're starting to work through the designs of your application and you start to say hi no I need a special button and it should really look like a fern that does this thing because fairies on them or whatever well I don 't think people can understand what that icon is going to do right so use it conventions use those design conventions don 't reinvent the wheel unless you 've got something really special so there 's my little asterisks to say actually sometimes it 's worth reinventing the wheel but do it with with utmost caution consistency consistency consistency this is a big deal and I 'll kind of Harbor on it people if you do something one way or if I don 't suddenly change the rules it 's a really big deal the amount of times where you go on a website and the menu is here and then you press on about it and now the menu is here and then suddenly the word is here usually you used to the contact button is here but not on that page actually the contact buttons down here and that stuff really breaks the flow of the website and guess what happens in your eight seconds by the way go on I can 't find what they want they get confused important the more users expectations prove right the more they will feel in control of the system and the more they will like it Jakob Nielsen is a very very clever marketing guru and usability expert and it 's absolutely true once you start getting the use of the system and you understand where to find stuff there 's a sense of empowerment that the user gets and they get comfortable and they feel smart and they feel like they can find stuff and they 'll come back to you and they 'll refer you and they 'll become the website of choice it 's very very important proximity this is a bit of a rule that we use in our user interface design methodology internally but group things that make sense to be near each other IE in gmail proximity principles refer to the grouping of related information if you 're got lots of actions that kind of make sense this is the bottom of the gmail letter when you if you get an email you can archive here even report this many more you can delete it there that the to you that you make to that email so it makes sense to put them all together don 't put them far away don 't put them in places that don 't make sense to people doesn 't make any sense it 's very hard can anyone tell me how to change your name in facebook in the app it 's really crazy hard you have to press on the Settings button in the top right corner go through three different menu items and then you 'll see a field that says change name you press on them change their and then you can get to change the name in LinkedIn there 's a button with little arrow next to it next to your name you just press that button and you can change your name that 's it so having things close to where you think the user action might actually occur is a no-brainer most of this stuff by the way is no brainer stuff when you hear it you go yeah that makes lots of sense great the reality is that most people do it feedback feedback so big one and it helps people feel like they know what the hell is going on tell these are what 's going on or if something is wrong tell them where they 're up to in the process that you want them to go through tell them if something hasn 't happened the upload failed or you 've got the form how many times have you submitted a form and it just disappears anything like did they get the form did I get it do I get an email at least did something happen maybe I 'll submit it again I don 't know maybe I don 't maybe this but scamming me and maybe this is actually a fishing lips feedback is really important because it gives people the sense of something is working it makes them feel smart it makes them feel like they 're on a legitimate website and meals like the stuff is happening so it 's really really important to get that right and if we can confirm that they 're actually have led to the right result you 're doing you government friends but speak in the users language which might not very well be the language of lots of acronyms and lots of weird internal strange ways to label something if you 're in an industry that uses a lot of acronyms or uses very specific technical language don 't assume that your customer consumer stakeholder understands what the hell any of that means more than likely they don 't more than likely people to speak in a conversational way typically like they would to anybody else but they speak to so even though you might be something something heavily technical okay there 's a room there 's place for that but make sure that the language that you 're using is the language of your user it 's really really important if you think every pixel every icon every typeface matters then you also have to believe that every letter matters that also comes to the core of content user interface design is often kind of lumped into this idea of designing the way a site looks but we 're also talking about the way this site works and so if you work in a very specific consumer market and you 're selling say I don 't know cleaning services right and we want them to just call us ultimately we want someone to just call me okay well then that 's going to shape the way that we design a website should be pretty clear the language should be pretty clear what we expect them to do should be pretty good the content has to be critically aligned to what the goal of the site is same in government same in non-for-profit same in b2b whatever it might be people forget that the content that is the bit that all the design kind of goes around it 's the most important bit get it wrong and no amount of user interface design will save your website because of your content sucks it sucks that 's it I can 't fix that yeah okay you 've got to embrace change and experiment it 's really really important not everyone will get it right this is my rinse and repeat ultimately you 're going to design you 're gonna make many people build a website a cup done the website tick finished it I 'm moving on I 'm never going to look at it again for four years of the budgets gone anyway and it 's finished and and what will happen is that hey guess what your website looks like in four years piece of really bad website design because the the Internet has moved on quite frankly it 'll probably move on in six months if you 're not constantly reiterating and touching on your website making it better and talking to your consumers and talking about what 's going on in your marketplace you will be out there you will be left behind the website is a growing constantly evolving things so make sure that you do that make sure you experiment with stuff try something new see if it works if it doesn 't work don 't worry about it it 's no you 're not putting a book it 's not like you only get one chance to get this right and then it has to go out and you can never change it tomorrow and it 's fine and it 's quite acceptable and you should and most people don 't embrace that huge amount of power that they have over this publishing means you 've got this way to communicate with people that you can it 's live make it alive most people probably don 't know it everybody does that the biggest tech company is the world redirect and change and experiment all of the time and many times they 've got it wrong any gmail users here regular gmail users anyone remember when they changed some of the nav items are the top two so you used to have docs and bubble encounter and stuff for the time that it just disappeared one day and you 're like what the Freak just happened well that that 's what happened what the hell does that mean if I didn 't tell you what had just happened would anyone have told me that that 's where you press to go to your calendar as well as your darks as well as all the other various apps that they merge together into one went to but they still keep their holding on to a pretty tight because it 's part of their ethos to kind of get all of their apps into place but and educating people is well they 've got enough users to maybe just Ram it down our throats I don 't know but I would call that a bit of a UI fail I would say that that was user interface design that didn 't really make sense huge company lots of resources they still got it wrong guess what they might change again next month they 're going to reiterate an experiment and in fact often they 'll release changes in batches to certain little groups test it out come back try again we highly encourage micro-business massive business doesn 't matter it 's not hard to do change it change your text that 's really easy to do just change we had a ecommerce client that sold bikes we experimented for a month on the head up image of a special bike that they were selling in just different colors turns out red bike sell the most on the cycle change them every day change them on different days changing with different times what happened red bike sold more so most of the bikes on that website are actually read might change it around again later but it 's an easy change to do I didn 't print it it 's not i 'm not putting a ball crying i can just change this tomorrow do it again see what happens you 've got to do it preferred actions this is another one this is another one that i think so i think this is another Twitter weirdness so does anyone know what you 're supposed to do on this website because my understanding is that the preferred action is to I 'm sorry the screenshots look great anyway but it 's rubbish in real life anyway compose new tween is down here and that 's the other that 's that I would have I would have thought that that writing a tweet was my primary action on the Twitter homepage however I would kind of argue that maybe search or read the fees might be the this is kind of hidden away and hard to find this is kind of not really that clear I mean I reckon it 'd be a generous people that don 't know what a quill is so anyway so that 's a thing and again huge company lots of resources you I possible fail maybe in an experiment I don 't know that 's what it was like this afternoon so it 's okay to muck it up that 's probably ok but it again and you need to experiment just the same way baby steps this is another one that people make a lot of mistakes as well users are more inclined to perform complex actions if it 's broken down into small steps look at the form on the right this is the form on the Left which form is the one that you feel like you want to fill out you know and it 's just based in it 's just they 've broken up their information from your smileys and in two little tabs so you kind of fill out this section then you go to more consumable then ok what is there and then put in some photos than the marriage and there 's stuff in five columns across that 's hard to use that 's just basic principles of user interface we want an easy I 'm so we want people to fill out that form well how would you want to fill out that form ask yourself that question so if i get so that 's just three examples of things that you know that other people have made terrible mistakes or had but the reality is that it 's easy to change it 's really easy to kind of get into engaging professional or an expert in the field will help you make those decisions potentially but often it is kind of no-brainer stuff that you just have to stop and think about and try to get the experience right on your website crafted thanks you _"

systems which will allow you to achieve more by spending less so will certify discussing what open source is it 's a product built by community of well developers in collaboration it 's universally accessible available via free license you don 't have to pay for it and it 's vendor-neutral if you don 't like the person you 're working with or you feel that you can get a better deal elsewhere you can talk to them what is the CMS it 's a content management system it 's a platform or interface that allows you to publish content on a website it usually uses a visual interface known as a WYSIWYG or what you see is what you get interface to allow you or your team to manage add edit removal published content from your website from an interface that 's available via a web page so you can edit your website or otherwise you have an internet connection there about for our popular CMS 's in our play today we have WordPress it 's the most popular CMS it 's originally adopted by bloggers that embraced by the community at large because it 's incredibly easy to use and very scalable Drupal is very similar to work press but it 's a more suitable for larger organizations because it has document management and the ability to manage a lot of users on your system magento is our one of the more popular e-commerce platforms for open source CMS 's it 'll allow you to build an online store out of the box quickly and easily joomla is a one of the oldest CMS 's but it 's established and considered stable by the way early the community at large for the moment we 'll talk to about the are the big three but our jungle is always an opportunity need why should you use an open source CMS to put it simply no fanfare you can do anything a license platform can but often at a lower cost it 's vendor-neutral some license opencms ours open source CMS 's that will allow you to do this scalability you can see that an open source CMS will allow you to upgrade your website as your business grows you can start small of a small website then as your business grows you can expand your website along with it it 's easy to use with that WYSIWYG what-you-see-is-what-you-get interface you and your staff or your pool of volunteers will be able to manage your website quickly and easily without having to become HTML or code experts abundant support developing community around open source CMS is a very responsive and will answer your questions you 've got access to trouble support I 've sorry troubleshooting forums faq s and if you throw a question at the person who developed your system they may respond to you quickly and efficiently what can an open source CMS do for you as you can see we have fundraising if you 're a not-for-profit you can use an open source CMS to set up at an online donation form you can manage your fundraising campaigns from a central platform you for checks to sign without having to wake your door knockers to come back in from the field fundraisings option their membership and event management systems if you have a lot of members they may be students or seniors or clients even you can use an open source CMS to manage these people get them the information and content they need allow them to manage their own information all without a with a paperless system that allows you to keep them are happy and informed quickly and easily database management if you have a lot of information you need to manage whether it 's a customer records management product inventory for your online store or any other huge amounts of information you need to manage from a central platform open source CMS is will allow you to do this previously years ago it may have cost you tens of thousands of dollars just to manage your database these days with open source you 'll be able to do it within a single website built with our responsive design from here we can see that as peoples are instant usage behavior accessing our websites from phones and tablets for example who here is using their desktop to access the are for the internet on a daily basis just from work or from home both but a lot of people especially be young I started moved towards phones and tablets boy boy villainy is it bigger you 're handsome who else is using open source CMS 's you 'd be surprised to find out who else has jumped upon the are the open source paradigm we see here that the job access website as a commissioned by the australian government is using drupal one of the CMS 's we 've talked about earlier it 's a website that 's designed for the vision impaired and the otherwise handicapped who may have trouble seeking jobs or otherwise acquiring the skills they need this website is rated triple-a compliant which is the highest level of accessibility you can get as rated by Vision Australia so this is a website managed by an open source CMS endorsed by the government that allows people to of all all ilks and walks in life access their website um release a notice that gov CMS which is a build of Drupal is now going to be our push as a standardized platform for us to work with so as you can see it 's popular within the government we can work with from with that if you thought the Australian Government 's endorsement wasn 't enough for you what if I told you the United States there whitehouse.gov website is being run by drupal once again this is a website that runs blog photo and live streaming content daily this is the American governments mouthpiece to the public they can access online petitions social media and otherwise interact with the government in a single centralized platform think about this a lot of people talk about the open-source platforms being susceptible to hacking I submit to you if the American government the one website on the Internet if ever was to be contacted and engaged by by our hackers or other viruses or exploits is willing to engage Drupal I suspect that 's a endorsement enough a little bit closer to home we see the dick smith our our Australian electronics distributor these days is using his website Dick Smith com to manage the thousands of dollars of transactions that happen daily it secure against hacking it 's a gorgeous website that represents the center of their digital marketing platform even closer to home camera who goes to sportsmans warehouse to get there are their sporting goods what one fellow could bet city sportsman 's warehouse the camera based retail has adopted magenta the online e-commerce platform to manage their our online store not only does it manage their

    "text": "i 'm rob armstrong as i said bullseye graphics my talk today is about building a website a recipe for success small businesspeople not-for-profits government anybody else recruitment okay so when I use the word sales the not-for-profits you need to substitute change the world and when I say sales to the government people you need to say say to yourselves assist and serve others I think is that it yeah so I 've instructed my little talk like a recipe that we would use to to make something and I 'll sprinkle in some real examples of some recipes that didn 't work out it 's not that I 'm mocking the people who made these mistakes I 'm not sort of having a go at them or anything I think one of the things we need to learn is to learn from other people 's mistakes so that 's kind of why I 'm using these examples I 've also got some Lowell cats just to help me with the sort of the humor side of things so they 'll be just moving along so our first ingredient agency who can do that for you and I would suggest that to find someone good you 've got to go back to sort of basic principles referrals from satisfied customers always a good one find sites on the internet that you like and have a look down the bottom generally good designers and agencies will put a little credit down the bottom and so you can pop onto that credit have a look at some of the other work they 've done if you like what they 've done get hold of them have a meeting check out the folio of course they can I only show you the best stuff they 're not going to show you the disasters but hey if they 've got a bunch of those it 's a pretty good sign ask some business owners from that folio what sort of experiences they had with that designer no harm whatsoever ring ring hi see you got your website done by X what were they like you know talk to people have a meeting with the people who are going to build your site and going to be kind of working together for at least a month and you 're going to be pretty close at times and there 's going to be a bit of friction at times so you need to sort of make sure you know I can I can work with this person okay next is the budget often well not often but sometimes we have people come to us and say well so I need a website how much is it going to cost me is it 's sort of an open-ended question it 's really quite tricky with what a website is is a website is here I 'm saying it 's a funnel that takes all of your exposure or the SEO all the other work that you 're doing to expose your company to communicate with people not channeling it into action and in this case I 'm sort of saying dollars because I 'm sort of small business but all those other things so my point would sort of be it 's not so much how much should it cost it 's how much is it 's that one spot that one key element so i would say spend as much as you possibly can afford on that one thing earlier we had a 27-percent online now that 's that 's a broad range of things that 's probably Adwords that 's all sorts of things that you 're spending money on i would say some percentage of that should be spent on your website not only in building the thing in the first place but ongoing maintenance updates all those sorts of things as well okay be clear about your goals so before you go into that meeting with your web developer think about what sort of things you really want to get out of this what does success look like to you what 's a good website how is it going to help you get where you want to go one of the methods I 've used with particularly when you 're dealing with a large organization who potentially have either already got a very big website or are going to get a big website one of the really good methods to go with decision makers get a bunch of post-it notes give everyone some post-it notes and pens those people write down ideas thoughts things they want to get done all that stuff goes on post-it notes big piece of board push the post-it notes all over it shift them around see where all the the most number of ideas where they cluster where they don 't cluster draw pencil lines between them all makes big mess but that way you start to get a feel for what you want to do how the site is going to be structured what sort of things you 're trying to communicate what 's important what 's not so important what sort of left field that you kind of think or hang on that 's kind of a good idea that we might move things towards that make it free at the start of the process keep it wide and open then focus as you move along the journey appoint a single point of contact within your organization to deal with the web developers or the web developer hopefully or the account manager for the agency takes all the ideas pushes them all through in one single way make sure that person has cleared the decks okay we had wanted business we about two days into the project the our central point of contact headed off to Hawaii and came back a month later and said okay so show me the website get used to disappointment if you 're going to do that I was actually really really surprised about that but yeah it doesn 't work you need to clear the decks you need to be able to prioritize this job above other things make yourself avail don 't don 't get into a flurry and wait situation that it 's it 's not a good way to build a website get all your logo logo branding and all your documents sorted out if you haven 't already got them sorted out get them sorted out before you start this process branding documents are just a godsend to a developer or designer because we 've already got the we 've got it there in front of us okay it 's got to have this much got to do this great brilliant get with gets us going gets us moving moving towards where we want to go around 2001 we were given I hope this is true as I stand here now a fridge magnet a floppy disk and a sheet of paper with handwritten notes in pencil on it all stapled together as our brief the staple went through the floppy does guess yes go figure that after we stopped laughing it became apparent that the client actually felt that we were going to fix this and proceed so to use our recipe analogy that 's sort of the equivalent sending the chef down to the shop with loose change to buy all the ingredients no way be careful about involving other designers quite often you 'll have an in-house graphic designer you 'll have someone who 's a bit creative in the office you 'll have an agency who already do a lot of your print exposure they might do some other work for you so you think well I 'll you know I 'll leverage off their expertise and then I 'll just of mechanically put it all together this doesn 't always go well the web web is a dynamic environment print graphic design is a very static environment ink on paper it 's always in the same spot it always works the same way web doesn 't as ang was saying all these devices are all different they 're all different sizes they 're all different shapes are all different it doesn 't happen that way so for example we we had one in-house designer who 's came up with a design that only worked on his Macintosh in safari in a dark room with the screen on a hundred percent brightness I 'm not kidding so do graphic designers make good web web developers sometimes yes they certainly do there 's designers out there who are so darn good at everything they 're able to adapt and that 's fine but not always okay if you if you don 't like the heat keep out of the kitchen this is a sort of perennial problem in our in our area you 've hired this designer there at the top of 're great and now you want to impose your personal taste on the design in my experience this leads to three possible reactions from a designer the first one is the designer just becomes this glorified kitchen hand and runs back and forth between the kitchen in your table carrying out every single thing you tell them to do second one the designer goes yeah look I 'm not sure this is going to be so good and tries to work with you they show you examples of things that have worked they go side by side they do a compromise to try to work with you or they just go not it 's my way or the highway any of these scenarios it 's not a good result it 's not going to get you an award-winning design it 's going to get you a compromise and that 's probably not a good thing the problem here is that you guys hold all the cards you 're paying the checks so you 're essentially putting the designer the developer the agency whoever you 're putting them in a situation paying them so boy they 're going to have to be really experienced really confident and actually in a sort of a space in that business where they 're prepared to take you on and possibly lose chances are most people won 't_''_663.449 they won 't take you on they will fold and they will go towards whatever compromise they can to get you to work I would argue that that 's not a good outcome for you or for the designer so if you do want to get involved in the kitchen and you really want to get in there at all those pants you need to be able to communicate in language that the designer or the developer understands and you need to be able to show them examples of something you like here 's something from a magazine it looks great I know it 's not web but this is the style I want that 's good communication here 's a font that I like okay cool that 's good communication if you 're starting to say things like electric blue electric blue isn 't a color like make it pop make it pop is not a layout it 's it 's sort of a contrast comment I think I 'm not sure clean isn 't a font to the best of my knowledge I I do check google fonts occasionally and I haven 't yet seen cleaned as a phone what maybe or two would be interesting with me give clear feedback so most developers designers will give you a few drafts to look at okay something to pick from something that they propose something they think you 're going to like if you don 't like it fine but talk about what you don 't like about it make it absolutely crystal clear what doesn 't work what does work those kinds of things if you know you market so well that you feel that your ideas are more than valid great communicate it things like give it zip that 's not feedback sex it up I 've actually been asked this is a government department asked me to sex up a website I don 't know what that means well well I do have you 're writing your own content well okay possible proofread it sounds obvious check it thoroughly before it gets into the mixing bowl it you know you got all that the raisins and the flour and everything all mixed in there in the bowl and now we 're going to take all the stalks off the raisins are we it 's a lot of work involved if you pile on your content into a system and then edit it and then pile it all back in again more work spent there less work spent doing something useful like SEO or nice design or some other funky thing there 's plenty of in professional riders out there who can write for the web maybe engage them the other nice bonus you get there is they 've probably come across this thing called SEO search engine optimization which is the big thing currently because hey everybody wants to be at the top of google search google search is the biggest player in town we all have to play with google sandbox that 's reality so SEO if you can get a good the money and getting them to write the content and them to put the keywords and phrases in when everybody wins test the mixture the nice thing about web is you can test the mixture before you bummed in the oven okay you can do a development site you can check it out I would suggest strongly that you launch that development side it 's sometimes called a soft launch and get some people to check it out a good cross-section of your demographic sit them down and say when you go to this website you need to know how big X is and how much it costs and then you stand back and watch them do it on a laptop in front of you out of that comes the feedback you need to improve your website okay online forms a notorious for problems post-launch so get some people to fill out your online forms have a look at the results you get from that make sure that 's actually what you need to find out from that form test test is so I hope you and all enjoyed that _"

    "text": "hi thank you coming along this evening thank you to digital camera pharmacy invite me along to come from you all about I guess some of the trends over the last and seeing the scene over the last ten years but I think again I think today is a big milestone I guess for launching the Wi-Fi I think it 's um we are at that point i think in canberra where we are seeing is shipped and as a city we 're really evolving so i think we 've got a really good exciting next 12 months and a future ahead of us so i guess kicking kicking off i wanted to talk about the the last 10 years and where we sort of come from I think it 's pretty exciting in such a short amount of time we are we have more devices than ever in our homes we are more connected than ever before and that 's why I really want to talk about I guess the hyper connected customer and client and user and I 'm probably the worst because I even challenge it going they probably don 't like me too much but I kind of like to play in all the different spaces so all of us now we are on average between three and four devices we we now spend which is the next so I 'm going to go into around about 23 23 to 25 hours roughly now online a week again as you can see you know ten years ago that was highly anything you know on average and we can see even over the last 10 years how internet connectivity has really evolved gnarly with with Wi-Fi with with the connection speeds but I guess all the different providers and services bring to us so as a result of all of that you know we now have more devices to access these services and we 're actually able to do a lot more so it 's really shaped how we we search for information we connect and talk with people so I guess a good snapshot of a guest the device in there in our homes and where the shift is actually really changed as you can see has had a bit of a decline as obviously you know we 've become more mobile new devices event in the market like our tablets internet-enabled TVs I mean 10 years ago to think that you would actually be able to you know watch your traditional free to air on an aerial and then all of a sudden just pour the connected go online and do a Google search on some think you know and all those things at Apple TV you know being able to stream something without having to have a bucket load of dvds hanging around the side of your TV so i think is really important to to to really understand as a big overarching friend um what all these devices have done shaped our lives how we have completely in some ways become connected and the way we actually now consume information has really changed so and the biggest one has been fun so you know ten years ago it was WOW now if we 're talking about laughs and notice devices we probably like what are you talking about so I think it 's to really understand that the journey that a user goes now because that that has been the significant shift I guess from from where we were ten years ago so the notion of being able to start something on TV pause it pick it up on your tablet on your work and then you know at the same time shoot off some emails talk to your friends via social media that that is a huge ship that 's happened in the last 10 years so it was really important to recognize this now to really plan for it and in some ways you know even optimize your own mediums and advertising spend now so again atmos as as the rest of the guys will talk on the panel it 's all these things we talked about you know optimizing your website for the best mobile experience really understanding the value of generating quality content that people can easily you know digest and share all these things really had a lot of value into this sort of new ecosystem of devices that we all own so on that point social so the birth of social and where we were you know we only had one hour 10 were really sort of active compared to you know seven out of ten of us are now highly engaged highly active on multiple social media networks so so again you know over the last 10 years the way we communicate has really changed and evolved and it 's only going to further evolve as you know these networks or I guess enhance you know as Internet connectivity gets even better but we 're always going to see this rapid change so I think it 's really important to understand and appreciate where social nail kits in the ecosystem is a important part about everyday life so we can 't really ignore it and we really need to know how to use it and harness it um cnam from the advertising industry I thought I 'd better show a bit of a shift of where we 're now even advertising marketing spending is moving towards so you know 10 years ago really only represented a small percentage I guess you know a traditional marketing budget 10 years you know it 's that increased to to an average roughly twenty-seven percent so when you are planning I think you know we 're no longer in that time where you can just I guess you know media to become very fragmented we can 't just sit and do our traditional things we need to consider that you know the traditional TV Seether you might have is probably going to be watched on a tablet and we need to optimize our advertising and marketing and capture these markets from an advertising perspective so it 's really important to plan for this to consider it to test it and that 's the big thing you know a lot of people it 's about just testing the water sometimes using your analytics growing learning and then and then optimizing so it 's really important to take that into consideration when you are planning your marketing so I guess in wrapping up what is this or me so from a website UX design perspective to your content management systems to even the design of your website all these aspects play a that a piece of content is is not only going to be consumed on one medium it 's this idea that you know it is an ecosystem that we are going to actually you know start reading the newspaper at the coffee shop but then we 're going to finish that article as we 're walking back on our phones so really understanding the different touch points that that we now have with all the different devices I still think one of the big ones is is going back in your content and this is where the content management systems really come into play is keep it keep it simple keep it relevant make it easy for people to share make it engaging it 's it 's one of those things where I think you know and we all get busy using our lives busy in our businesses but try and take a time out to sort of go back and refresh it it 's no longer we can sort of you know set it there and forget because people want to have great content and they want to learn to help educate to help a number of different ways to connect with your clients so I think it 's really important to to keep that in mind of your time planning I think I might end up there so that all the other speakers you know get a bit of time to get in but again I think that 's a great starting point and understanding from you know where we 've come in the last 10 years and how the devices we are really shape I guess the way we now build and generate and share and communicate thank you _"

    "text": "2014 and that 's probably as much as i wanted to say i could keep going but you know you might have some questions yes i 've been wondering all throughout um because i work for disability asia yes and i know there are people out in the community who would like to access support systems who aren 't currently who aren 't currently yes yes are they going to be preferenced is there any strategy for the people who are in support yes are they going to be put on the back burner that is part of that phasing discussion that i was mentioning before so yes yes oh sorry so the question was what happens with people who are not currently receiving any government-funded supports and i 'm sure you all know people like that i can only speak about the experience in the trial sites to date so absolutely that 's recognized there 'll be a component of people in the act who will be able to access the scheme because i 'll meet the access requirements who are not currently receiving any government funded supports so trial sites as new clients only because they 're not currently receiving any government funded supports i don 't know exactly what 's going to happen in the act they will be able to access the scheme there 's nothing that will prevent them from doing that but exactly how and when they will be phased in here i don 't know in the other trial sites anybody who was currently receiving support from any government-funded scheme we could identify those people either directly or through their current providers and so we were able to get in contact with them but of course the people we don 't know we don 't know and so if you know anybody like that tell them to contact the agency after the first of july tell them to go to the website do the my access checker and if you just say to them look we don 't know at the moment how new people are going to be brought in but we should know that very soon in the other trial sites what they did was allow people who were new clients were in the trial site they were living there they met the access requirements they could contact the agency at any time yeah yes um i 've got two questions yes my first question is about is other supports like the disability pension investor all of those kinds of support yes will they be affected by ndis okay so the question was will other forms of support like the disability support pension better start and the hackwa funding so i used to actually i started the better start program don 't hit me but i implement i implemented that program um so they 're two very different things so i 'll deal with the dsp first i want you to hear this message once only the dsp is not affected by the ndis and the reason is the disability support pension is income support it 's a completely different category of support to support that people get under the ndis the ndis is about disability supports to increase participation it 's not about paying for rent or food or any of normal expenses of daily living which is what the on a dsp they need fear not it won 't be affected at all by them becoming a participant that 's a really important point they can still access funding exactly as they do now they will continue to get their dsp um that is their income you know the other one aqua and better start so helping children with autism and the better start programs it was one of the programs identified as in scope so there 's another bit of jargon for you an in-scope disability program all jurisdictions went through a process of identifying every funding stream that was disability support and there 's a long list for each jurisdiction the oct went through the same kind of process the intention is eventually that all of those funding sources will roll into the ndis but it 's happening in a gradual way so obviously you just can 't_''_269.759 unpick all of those arrangements immediately some some of you will work for providers for example who are block grant funded so in the other jurisdictions it wasn 't possible to just simply undo all of those arrangements for till end of june 2015. so you can 't just say sorry guys we 're ripping the money off you so it 's going to be a gradual thing in south australia which is probably the best example because they 're dealing with children in that age group right now as parents have had their planning conversation with the agency they lose access to better start and helping children with autism which makes sense because ndis will provide the disability supports that that child will need yeah what the other thing yes i 've got around you know when you 're talking about potentially the need for support increasing yeah so when there are situations that mean that the disability and aging supports kind of me is that distinguished uh i 'm not sure i understand the question i 'm thinking of say someone with down syndrome for example down syndrome yeah where perhaps the incidence of alzheimer 's or something like that may increase oh i see yeah those supports related to the onset of our science yes is that distinguished separately from the disability probably not i mean level of disability so if they 're already a participant in the scheme and they needed additional disability supports because of early onset alzheimer 's or whatever that could be part of their plan yeah yes that 's right i mean there is a distinction i need to be a bit careful here because i 'm not a doctor there is a distinction between supports provided through the health system which are about medical complaints that need medical treatment visit to doctors hospital admissions that kind of thing which should rightly be paid for by the health system but anything else which is about supporting that person to participate to go to work to be at home to do the shopping whatever that 's the ndis responsibility so there is a rule called support for participants which is worth looking at because you can understand there are a number of those interfaces where there needs to be some discussion in every jurisdiction about how that will actually operate um yeah very you know not necessarily black and white but anything that that had an impact on their level of disability plan yeah um so you had a question and then we 'll go you and then i 'm just thinking um in my mind about insurance yes in my mind my insurance covers certain things yes medicare covers certain things yeah um and the way it works is that if i have an and i go see a doctor and um i get an invoice or receipt yes and they partially cover it that 's right and then you pay the gap yeah yeah so with the ndis the person then goes to the planner yes um they are subject suggest i mean they they come up with a plan yes and they are allocated a certain amount of funding now um that 's a big bunch of money say it 's thirty five thousand dollars is that for the year is that for those things that they 've identified that they want um do you go back and say look this is not working for me or i finished that yes something else yes um you know is that all stuff that still needs to be worked out uh but it 's an uncapped scheme so the question was um a person goes along they get a plan they get a certain amount of money allocated is that annually what happens if they spend it faster than the year um what happens if they need more would they be the main points yeah and what happens if they want something and it 's much more expensive i think was the other thing i was reading into there so let 's just look at that so the plan is constructed on a person 's anticipated disability support needs usually over a 12-month period usually but it can be a shorter period than that and a review date could be built in earlier if that was felt that that was necessary so normally that money would be for the disability supports required by that person for an annual period yep if the person is self-managing their funding at the moment only about 10 of people choose to actually actively manage their funds themselves can you imagine the burden i wouldn 't want to do it um but say they were managing in one go it 's worked out between the planner and the person how often they might get paid generally i think it 's about monthly so they 'll get an allocation monthly and that 's to pay for their supports for that month if they don 't spend that money that money gets rolled into the next allocation so if you don 't spend it like there 's no need to save i mean this is another message to get out there you don 't need to hoard your disability support money because you think you might like to do something next month you need to actually think about what you 're going to need month by month for people who are not self-managing what happens is the provider invoices the agency directly for the supports that are providing so they never see the money they just get the supports the provider accesses through the provider portal and they get paid within a couple of days of submitting the invoice but the people can still go into their plan and see what 's been provided by whom and you the pricing structures worked we had people working in every jurisdiction to kind of come up with what were the prices being paid locally so in fact they 're slightly different in every jurisdiction we didn 't want to disturb any local markets we wanted to make sure that people were paying being paid properly for the supports that they were receiving so the plans are calculated on that and if a person got halfway through the month say they were self-managing and they 'd spent all their money that would be picked up very quickly and we need to work with them to make sure that you know their plan did fit what they needed and maybe it did need something does need some adjustment so in a sense there 's enough flexibility in the scheme to make sure that people 's needs are being met the plans will match their needs the payments that they 're getting should actually match the supports that they 're receiving and somebody is looking at that data all the time this is who would want to be an actuary honest to god to making make sure that plans supports in there dollars going out are all lining up in cases where people want something that say i 'll use a frivolous example say somebody wanted a platinum plated turbocharged wheelchair if there isn 't if there even even is such a thing when somebody needs a really expensive piece of equipment or a very unusual support or maybe something that 's innovative or new or hasn 't been tried before what 's called a benchmark price will go into their plan so that goes in as a benchmark price and then quotes will be sought so we 're talking about vehicle modifications home modifications very expensive pieces of equipment and and the prices will come back and say the person want you know that comes back this one 's really good and this is what we 'll pay if the person wants the next one up and they 're determined to have that they can pay the difference just as you would you know with other things yeah applied services as well in terms of coding it could apply to services i happened but but it 's possible that that could happen if somebody really wanted a you know aaa platinum-plated service for something and they could justify that that 's what they needed feel that that is what is going to make them and they 're happy to pay whatever the the premium is yes that 's right i i just can 't give you an example but i can 't see that that wouldn 't be something that wouldn 't be considered yeah yeah so we 're going here and then here and then for learning reason yes why did you cut off the uh why did you cut off assistance at age 65 i mean okay yes i 'll talk about that yeah two you have i can think of at least maybe about three people yes who are in accommodation support yes we 'll be getting quite a bit of yes yes we 're already heading into the 65 very yes yes they 're also running into dementia because of the condition yes thirdly is it right to see the ndis agency actually targeting the newer people who looking at those who are having some privilege yes accommodation support does it make sense yes it does so um the first question was why does it cut off at 65 so i 'll start with that one um that is that 's a policy decision about this scheme really being for people who are not aged and so we have an aged care system that kicks in when people turn 65 but the very important thing for you all of you to know is if any of your participants under 65 come into the scheme when they get to 65 they can choose to remain in the ndis so remain a participant in the scheme or to transition to the aged care system so um once once you 're in there you know that choice is there once they turn 65 in a sense it is about managing those boundaries you know we are again that 's one of those interface issues so when you 're 65 if you need it you can enter the aged care system you go into residential aged care if that 's what you parallel but if you 've got somebody in the scheme under 65 who 's quite well who doesn 't need that they can you know they can choose to remain in the scheme the second one was about people in residential aged care who are coming up to 65. who are in supported accommodation who are coming up to 65 so again that is part of that phasing issue clearly the act government is aware that there are some people coming up to 65 for whom it might be beneficial to come into the scheme so i know that that is being thought about and that 's probably as much as i can say about that and the third thing was no i can 't remember this is this agency looking at new people though yes kind of support yeah which are quite plentiful in the east yes i understand yes oh are they still going to concentrate on people who have got some benefits yes but need to be more open to community participation and means yes yes between them yeah and and again i can 't answer that trial side experience so far so anybody who fell into that category of not receiving any support they could contact the agency the moment the 1st of july clicked over and they could enter the scheme but in the act that phasing is still to be determined but there 's another question i can hear in there which is about the importance of connecting people not just to disability supports but also to those other things and so you will get a certain proportion of people coming in who certainly have a permanent disability whose impact of the disability is certainly significant but who might not need very much and it might be much more about connecting them in a better more effective and sustainable way to community and mainstream supports rather than funded supports yeah yeah this one yeah just um quick question does the scheme cover um illnesses such as cancer things like that no maybe short or long term yeah no so this is that interface issue so the question was do the does ndis cover cancer and medical medicine illnesses like that and the answer is interface issue with health so if you have a health condition that 's managed largely in the health health sector even though it can have a disabling effect it 's still really about managing that condition in the health sector yeah yeah and look again you know it 's not all black and white you know there may be some instances where it 's a combination of disability and a medical condition but our planners are going to well they 'll look at all of that yeah sorry and you have a question or three the two of them yeah one was the means testing it 's not means tested how much money not means now mobility allowance was one of those in-scope programs so one of those programs it 's a federal program mobility allowance it was identified as an in-scope program which means that eventually all of that money will roll into the ndis for people who are currently receiving it they 'll continue to receive it until the point they transition into the scheme and then it 's taken care of in their in their support plan yes have agreed to keep funding here um community access right yeah but with the ndis if he can 't access that um because of his age we just don 't know where to find community access for him yeah aged care a lot of the programs um but he his disability can make him quite disruptive so they really want me just don 't want him yes and won 't have him in their program yeah so so again i come back to this agreement between all governments about continuity of support he won 't be the only person who is currently receiving disability supports who won 't be able to access the scheme and governments have agreed that where that 's the case they will continue to provide continuity of support for people like that yeah now who was next yes up the back yes it relates to that one um is there a list of in-scope programs yes there is uh well there was a whole list of all of the in-scope programs for i don 't know if you publish your list no okay for the are all the intergovernmental agreements so that identification of in-scope programs happened as part of that intergovernmental agreement so you can find the list there no that 's a different thing all together that 's a i mean people sign up to that privately anyway it doesn 't affect medicare itself it 's yeah no nothing to do with it yeah no you can you can just forget about worrying about that one yes um so what about those people who are currently funded now through a block program yeah but then when it the ndis they may not be eligible to access the ndis again coming back to that idea of continuity of support there will be people that you work with who possibly will not be able to access the scheme and all governments have agreed where supports are being provided to somebody who 's not not then able to access the same they can continue to access the supports they 're receiving now so does that mean blog funding programs you know how you 're saying that block funding programs are going to be phased eventually in what i 'm saying um people that won 't fit yes there are and probably particularly around some mental health stuff as well yeah yeah what happens what happens there block funding is going to be yes eventually it is true so for most um programs where the funding is provided through block grant funding most of that will be unpicked but what we don 't know in the act is really what the environment is going to look like here in the longer term and all jurisdictions have got an eye to the fact that look there might be a case in some instances for some program still to be block funded because each person who 's who 's a participant in that program takes a tiny tiny slice of it it might not make sense to then make that an individual support that 's included in their plan but this is something that you know we 'll be looking at very carefully over the next couple of years particularly in the act yeah yeah how will you identify those people uh well that 's a good question uh they might they might come into the shop front they might do the my access checker and find that they 're not able to access the scheme but there is an area of concentration which is those people who have disabilities who are not able to access the scheme in other words it 's not permanent and or it 's not significant enough or they don 't meet the early intervention requirements and some support can still be provided to those people it 's been called tier two up until now it 's a horrible term but you know people with disability who don 't meet the access requirements and so just exactly how that will work in the longer term i don 't know can i just add something there one of the things about the act is it 's really a very small community we 're talking about 65 or so specialist disability services that are currently working with people with disability or psychosocial disability that are likely to be impacted and phase into the national disability insurance scheme you know the people that you 're working with working with better than anybody else so we 're going to know if people are phasing in we 'll we 'll be able to say exactly who will phase in at what point your organizations will know that information in the next few weeks you you 'll be able to see exactly who and how and when and we 'll be working with you with your organizations to enable that to happen as smoothly as possible so it is a good thing we 're a small community if there are five or six people for example in a particular program that aren 't a that aren 't going to move over then we need to work with your organization to ensure that there is that continuity of support yes for example some clients they probably um receive support from uh from our organization yes yes because we have government funding because they don 't have individual funding and in future if they 're not eligible for the ndis will test your guest service yes so yes so well i don 't know exactly where the money is going to come no i don 't know exactly because those arrangements are still being worked out but that is essentially the same question as i 've had a few times now about continuity of support there is no doubt that a proportion of the people you work with will not be able to access the scheme because they won 't meet the access requirements but all governments do recognize this all of them have said that they have absolutely committed to provide continuity of support whatever that looks like so those discussions are happening now for the act yeah or all i can what i can tell you is it hasn 't proved to be too much of a problem anywhere else so that to me is a good sign you know it seems to me we are targeting the people we ought to be targeting and um it does just doesn 't seem to have been a problem across the existing sites yeah the second question is at some point they receive services from different organizations yes yes support yes um when they apply for funding for mbi yes um who yes will they apply separately no no no no this is one of the big things so yes in the past it meant you applied here and you got a little bit of this and you applied here and you got a little bit of this no no more you come to the ndis your package of supports is constructed the people who work for the agency will connect you with providers if you 've not previously been pre provide you know connected with them or if you want to stay with the same providers because you 're happy with what they 're providing and how they 're providing it that is also possible but it 's a single application form a single plan a single conduit that means clients need to apply for funding um with with their families help they can they can service the provider help them and you the the planner you meet in the park yes who is the planner the planner um with your organization yes yes with the ndia yeah yeah does that mean like um if as a service provider if we yeah do we need to have a big meeting with all the service providers um no so essentially it will either be the person themselves who is applying for access to the scheme families and carers are going to be in there of course for many people and probably a lesser proportion will have no you know significant person in their lives to help them in that in that case it could be a service provider essentially it 's up to the person themselves so whoever that person wants to help them with the process and to help them with the planning process it 's it 's um it 's open to them people have had advocates you know formal advocates come with them they 've had a nominee or a guardian you know through that process yes yes their families get the parents too old so yes yeah technology yeah it 's really hard yes indeed indeed and for those you know very rare instances where you might have a client who has no other significant person in their life under our legislation the ndia can appoint a nominee possibility yeah so um when when someone goes on and does the check yeah the my access checker does that and it says whether they are or aren 't yes whether they are does that trigger the department or the sorry but does that trigger them to send them a letter or is it just give them the reference number no it 's a bit more complicated so um once we 've got the phasing once we know what the phasing is the messages on the my access checker will be slightly altered so that people will get a much better sense of when they 're likely to come in for the moment because we don 't have that detail it just says contact us after the first of july and as i said it it generates a ref a unique reference number and once that 's entered in after the first of july it pulls up the information that person has provided that 's why it 's important to keep it but look if you lose it doesn 't matter you can do it again post one july um 800 number to make an appointment for example which is what happens in some of the other trials driven by the person that 's doing the checking for the moment it is yes but remember i said once we know with some reliable certainty who is coming in in what order we will write to them directly yep so they 'll have that contact as well yes okay okay all right can i ask about the goals yes you have a client that comes in to do their planning yes who says my goal is great which is great yeah great but they don 't acknowledge that they can 't get out of bed or they can 't um shower or but they 're they 're adamant that 's their goal right that sounds very tricky yeah but it possibly can happen possibly can happen because yeah these goals are very different to their practicalities indeed yeah and this is and this in a sense comes back to what i think what i was trying to say before but probably didn 't say very well the whole issue about goal to me is like a flight of fancy almost you know i 'd like to go on a world cruise the steps between where that person is now and getting to that goal seem very long at least to me even for me thinking about going on a world cruise is you know a very long distance goal so doing some pre-planning with families and participants well before they get to the first planning session is our goal so that people understand what a goal is and how it 's achievable and understanding the steps and what it is the agency can actually provide to people to help them achieve their goals is going to be very important i 'm just wondering about the how well the planners actually know get to know the people and the interviews done at home yep they can be absolutely so i didn 't say that before although we 've got shop fronts our planners spend 70 to 80 of their time out of the office very very different i agree yeah yeah no that 's exactly right so most people prefer to have some people like to come in because it gives them a break from the rest of their world but you know if people want to have their um planning and assessment conversations in a coffee shop or local library or you know whatever whatever it 's all fine yeah just going on a little bit from that question yes my question is around um will there be some kind of registration process for service providers yes to kind of regulate yes yes yes could be the potential for there to be some flooding some snake oil salesmen maybe planners yes yes so so yes providers who want to connect with ndia participants who are not self-managing so people who are self-managing can really buy their services from anywhere they choose but as i said the majority of people up to 90 percent are choosing to allow the ndia to manage their resources which is much less burdensome on them and that means we have to have a process of registering and being able to say yes this is a legitimate provider so in the other sites i think the registration but we 're hoping to open it a bit sooner in the act there is a process for the moment in each of the jurisdictions we 've accepted the existing quality assurance processes that are in place for those providers but in the longer term the agency is going to be working on a nationally consistent accreditation and quality assurance process that is a longer term piece of work um couldn 't have that in place for the first of july last year but it 's certainly underway now all right this one and then back on so it doesn 't collect a lot of demographic data this was the idea so that we didn 't want to have risks with people 's personal information okay so that 's going to be my question if that comes up and says no you 're not eligible yes i mean there will be some things that will be very hard and fast so somebody from yes for example you know they 're not eligible they have to meet the basic eligible you know access requirements but if it comes up it doesn and fast things that you 're not in jurisdiction you 're not a person with disability you know etc etc it will say it does not appear and then still invite them to contact after the first of july yeah yeah yes so i wanted to ask around um the experience that you 've had in other places so far around people with very serious mental illness yes especially maybe if there 's a lack of insight yeah um i actually don 't have anything i can share with you i think after the last one this this also came up and i said i was going to ask my colleagues in each of the existing trial sites about whether they 've got any examples so i will still do that i don 't have anything specific i can share with you about that yeah the numbers like to me five thousand in the asia and maybe doesn 't sound that big yeah have all you know have those people kind of been counted yeah well i i expect so yeah just in terms of looking at what the projected who 's currently assisted by the service system and and there is some about 2 500 people roughly there 's different figures that are currently accessing formal um support services so actually getting to 5000 or 5075 is is a significant increase in the number of people that would be able to be or expect to be eligible for services when we 've looked at who 's in the service system and who should be eligible we 've looked across the hack the home and community care program we 've looked into the mental health services to look for those people who would indicate to have a psychoso disability needs related to psychosocial disability or support needs as opposed to those people who are unwell or have health needs related to their psychosocial disability and the numbers we 've had in the ict i think is a projection of about 950 people that would be eligible so we 've actually got a lot of scope to ensure that everybody who need you know it it certainly will be more people will be accessing um services and then currently so and just select a provider that 's registered with you no no they can select outside so this is one it does become buy beware certainly and and i mean this is one of the complicating factors in an ideal world everybody would be self-managing and have the most at the broadest flexibility about selecting who provided their services and how but the reality is it 's only people who are self-managing that will have that high very high level of flexibility those who choose to self-manage the experience has been so far that most of them are people who 've got the skills to do that many people will select not to do it because and actually even people who 've got the skills to do it sometimes don 't want to do it just because of the sheer amount of work involved but yes it does become biab aware yep and somebody decides to allow the ndia to manage their funds yeah do they then still have the choice of service providers absolutely if the service provider is registered with you yes there 's no constraints put on um exact nominal hourly fee yes yeah the agency won 't say no we are going to choose the most economic service not for that so i could talk again about the trial side experience so in order to i mean it would have been very difficult for the agency at the outset to allow a completely unregulated provider market from the beginning you can understand why that would have been problematic we would have had no idea about what the costs were going to be so prices were set for those high volume regular supports that everybody needs say for example like personal care they looked at local markets they chose prices that were operating and existing in local markets and that 's the price i don 't i don 't know whether we 're going to do the same thing in the act i 'm sorry we can find that out for you so people can any provider who 's registered to deliver services in the act if a person 's got a package where they see you know they need x number of personal support hours a week there it 's only where they 're self-managing that they can choose outside because we have to have some way of connecting the participant with the providers to allow that invisible back of house payment um to occur it was just last year one of the wonderful things that stuck in my mind was some one of them somebody said that the end disability care as it was then um would become the largest purchaser of services in in the country yes no i have to say that no no we don 't we don 't purchase that they would choose reasonable and necessary yes and then if there were two services provided and at the outset they looked to be about the same then they would choose the cheaper one but that of course would fix that thing of choice yes it does yeah our service provider i think that was more um more to do with those high cost services so if there were two that were appropriate yes we you know when we 're talking about the platinum plated turbocharged wheelchair they 'd choose the one that if the person wanted the next level up then they could pay the difference yeah yeah co-payments are a possibility yeah sorry yeah and yeah and in kind so you know we talked about how some of the block grant funding cannot be unbundled for the commencement of the scheme here in the act so there will be some providers who continue to be block grant funded as they are in the existing trial sites and people can still choose to use they can use that and if they 're already receiving services they can stay with their provider but they don 't get paid for that because they 're already being paid you know that person 's already a client and they 're receiving service they 're still being paid and so they have to um an amount of money which is the in-kind amount that they 're contributing to the scheme is is allocated and set and then as clients use up that in-kind money people who are participants in the scheme and they get to the ceiling then they can take on new clients and be paid sort of a lay person 's guide of how in kind works one more question i think actually under the ndis agency under the scheme yes how how does it affect the support workers like that we have two categories the governmental support work and then not agency support yes yeah do you have a fixed rate for them or is it actually depends on what services are being provided but there and again i just don 't know in the ict whether we 're going to fix prices the the ceo is wanting to move to an unregulated market i mean that is the way you get best competition absolutely but unregulated where we don 't set prices anymore but at the moment we are setting prices and i don 't know whether we 're setting prices in the act now this i 'm not going to talk about setting prices but just in terms of employment conditions if you 're employed by an organisation now you 'd be covered by an award and those award conditions would be remain in place so most people are employed under an and if you choose to move to a different organization you 'd be covered by the awards and conditions of that employment all right one last one all right two last ones that 's it that 's it all right two more okay our friends that are in just out of the act yes yes um is there any idea when they might be no so that discussion with jurisdictions about how and where the rollout will continue beyond the trial period is happening now but that 's going to be very complex you know we 're going to move from the end of the third year from about 35 000 people into the scheme up to very rapidly around 450 000 people so i just can 't get my head around that but that discussion is happening now about where and how yeah and last one lucky last self-managing yep i got a client 's mother she told me she would like to purchase the personal care service from a particular nurse yes but the nurse may not register as a service right can can mother do if she as a service provider she possibly could register as a provider i mean sorry yes to register as a as a basic level yes you would need an abn to be able to register as a provider and you 'd have to have your own insurance in a sense you know it comes with that issue about buy-beware if you 're purchasing services from somebody that has a specialist aspect to it like that you 'd need to be sure that what you 're purchasing is what you 're going to get yeah there are um on our website already there are sample agreements for people who are self-managing so if people are thinking about seeking services from a particular service provider there 's a template um service agreement that they can use to you know formalize whatever the terms of that agreement are yeah all right well thank you very much for your fantastic attention _"

    "text": "so first of all thank you for making the time to come to today 's session it 's a session that is targeted directly at people who are supporting people with a disability directly you 're the people out there that have relationships and contacts with the people that the National Disability Insurance Scheme is all about so thank you for making the time I appreciate that many of you have come in your own free time so that 's a real show of your commitment to find out about this scheme and how you can assist the people you work with to know that it 's coming and how to be prepared for it before we start I 'm Sarah King I 'm from the AC T NDIS task force I 'm Jude but joined by Judith Davis Lee who is a director with the National Disability Insurance Agency and the agency is the entity that will be writing managing delivering the National Disability scheme in Australia in a CT from 1 July this year as it is throughout Australia before we start I would just like to pay 're meeting on today the Ngunnawal people pay my respects to their elders and leaders past and present and acknowledge and welcome any Aboriginal toast idolaters colleagues who are here today so I also like to thank the disability learning professional development network for putting on these sessions there will be more sessions across the AC t2 for workers to find out about the National Disability Insurance Scheme this is one of of many more to come I just like to say before we start the reason it 's so important that we have sessions for direct workers is that you are really the face of the service system you are the people with whom people with a disability rely for information not just support and services but for information and probably for a sense of optimism and confidence about what 's coming there has never been a larger more significant change to the human service system in Australia it 's a monumental change and there will be challenges trials tribulations through that journey but it is as you 'll hear from Judas one of the most important changes in lead good lives at the end of the session you 'll have the opportunity to ask questions if I could just ask you to check your telephones before we start make sure they 're switched off or on silent and I 'd just like to hand over to Judith Davis Lee now thank you hello everybody lovely to see a full room of people which means people 's interest in what I 'm going to talk to you today about is is high so thank you very much for coming I really appreciate it as Sarah said I 've been with the agency Sarah didn 't say that but I 've been with the National Disability Insurance Agency for almost two years so I joined them in June 2012 when it wasn 't called the agency yet it had a much longer name I think it was the National Disability Insurance Scheme launched transition agency which believe me is a mouthful so ndia is much better today is the first of April yeah hmm well I 'm not here to play a practical joke the NDIS really is coming to months time oh my god three months time there 's an awful lot of work to do before we open the doors but we are opening the doors on the 1st of July we might go to the first slide so all of you clearly have heard about the NDIS and all of you I 'm sure in your own way will know that this is something that has been a very very long time coming for people with disability more than decades probably but it 's most recent history began probably back in about 2008 when after the Rudd Government first came to power they made a commitment to hold a 2020 summit does anybody remember that hmm I was very interesting it was a way of sort of generating big ideas for us radius '_``_265.83 future well I think it 's safe to say that the NDIS was not just one of the ideas that came out of the summit it was the big idea that was raised at the 2020 summit in 2008 in fact it was put forward for consideration among others by Bruce Bona Haiti himself has two adult sons with severe cerebral palsy has been a service provider a philan philanthropist a leader in the field and so it was he proposing that this was at an idea whose time had come as a result of that idea the Australian government then asked the Productivity Commission to conduct an inquiry into the existing care and support arrangements for people with disability across Australia again I 'm sure this is something that you 're well aware of the report is some 1,100 pages long canvassed many thousands of views from people all across Australia I think it received over a thousand written submissions that 's as well as the discussions and conversations they had with people across the country and the resounding conclusion was indeed that we needed an NDIS because arrangements depending on where you live were either moderately okay or they were uniformly unfair or fragmented and so this is one of the legacies of having a federal system where you have state governments with different arrangements in place across Australia this is an attempt to create a single nationally consistent equitable fair that they can live a good life so it is very new it 's taken quite a radical approach an approach that I have to say has been trialed in pockets in some places and found to have been quite successful as a type of model but it is a scheme that will tailor supports to their individual needs now this is an enormous undertaking because it 's such a radical shift away from the way things operate currently so at the moment in all jurisdictions across Australia you have government 's responding to pockets of need a program is developed a funding stream is applied so many people X number of you know sessions of service in this time frame very rigid rigid programmatic responses to identified need this new system is going to unbundle all of those arrangements it 's going to unpick them all any program that currently devotes dollars to disability supports for people across Australia eventually that money will be uncoupled from the program all of that cash is going to flow into a single national bucket for disability support across Australia which will then choose in terms of their disability supports who provides it how it is provided but an enormous change I don 't think I need to convince you about that we 're going to use an insurance approach so what this really means is that vast amounts of data are going to be gathered over time so we 're very very new so we 've just had nine months of operations since the 1st of July last year if you want to think about it in terms of a lifetime where we 're a baby you know we 've only just been born I think by nine months kids are generally crawling yet so you know we 're on our hands and knees we 're making our way forward but clearly we 're going to bump into things you know we 're gonna get things wrong we 're gonna have to learn to crawl you know that crossed pattern that 's the best way to do it so we 're moving towards that kind of goal and hopefully by the end of the first year like most toddlers we 'll be the data about the outcomes for every individual this is what 's most important obviously all of us want the scheme to be sustainable over the long term there 's absolutely no point starting something like this and have it fail in two or three or four or five years and so data about the outcomes for individuals in other words the disability supports that people are receiving under the scheme and the difference that actually makes to their lives in other words the level of participation they 're able to take on because of the supports they 're getting under the scheme is going to be gathered absolutely carefully for every person monitored regularly we have a unit of scheme actuaries who 've been employed to look just at those things and so over time we 'll get a much much better picture an evidence base if you like about what does work for individuals in their individual circumstances but also be able to aggregate that data up to say for this group of people this is what seems to work best and you can see all of that choice and control is central and I 'm pretty sure I don 't need to convince any of you about the fundamental importance of individuals being able to exercise choice and control this is a fundamental human right and yet the reality is that for people with disability often they have not had the opportunity to exercise choice or to exercise control over the way they live their lives and in this scheme that extends to choice and control over the types of supports they receive how they receive them who provides them and under what circumstances the other fundamental difference if we go back to that idea of a need being identified a program being developed these are very narrow structures so they are not needs driven or all programs have a funding cap and once you get to that cap nobody else can access the funding under that program that 's the way it works this is not a capped scheme so people are not given a ceiling to which they can buy services that they need their plan is constructed according to their individual circumstances their individual out at the end of that process that is what that person is allocated under the scheme that 's a fundamental difference it 's delivered in local communities obviously you are part of that local community so yeah you 're in their boots and all and we are working towards national coverage so I again I don 't think I 'm going to need to convince this audience about the importance of starting small of getting it right of making adjustments and improvements as we go along to make sure that by the time we get to that point where we 're going to ramp up from the first three years of trial sites to a rollout that 's going to go across the nation we need to have the settings pretty well right so these first three years are going to be crucial in informing the people who are the scheme architects all the jurisdictions who 've bought in including the AC T that we can roll it out in a way that 's going to be there for the nation in decades to come and that is going moment we 've got seven trial sites that are being established over the first three years on the first of July last year we opened our doors and we had four trial sites across seven locations so they were in Tasmania where we have three shop runs the Barwon area of Victoria which is centered around too long they opened with just an office in Geelong but they 've now got an out posted office in Kolak so probably should be eight now anyway we 'll get to that minute the hunter in New South Wales which currently has an office in Charles Town and Charles Town sits right on the border of the Newcastle local government area and the Lake Macquarie government area so it 's in between the first two lots of people who will come in and in South Australia it 's the entire state of South who 's been to South Australia it 's enormous isn 't it and the distances between places in South Australia are enormous nevertheless they are doing the whole state for a child cohort so they 're doing from birth up years so all those young people are hitting those transition points about leaving school thinking about post-school up options going into employment and in Barwon and hunter they 're doing the entire age group he 'll be will be eligible to access the scheme from birth up to 64 so you can see those three pieces will fit very nicely together now the oct is a little bit different again so even though we 're doing birth to 64 here commencing in july we are behaving in the acct as if this is full scheme rollout so we are commencing here because the intention is to bring in every single person with disability who will be able to access the scheme over a two-year period so at the moment the estimates set out at about 5,000 people they estimate will be eligible to access the scheme and just how we 're going to do that we haven 't quite got the answer in but you can imagine if we open the doors in our Northbourne Avenue office and in EMU Bank on the 1st of July and we get two quite difficult so there 's a discussion going on at the moment between the acct government and the Commonwealth about how exactly we 're going to bring people in so we need an orderly progression of people into the scheme in the acct and what I can tell you is based on the experience from the four trial sites that commenced last year that actually worked very well so they did it slightly differently in each place so sometimes it was about ages so in South Australia for example they started with the baby 's first bringing in subsequent 2 to 3 year olds and 3 to 4 then 4 to 5 they 're doing 6 to 13 in the second year and so on in the Hunter it was a combination of where you lived so there are three local government areas involved so they said let 's go with the Newcastle LGA first but there are some complicating overlays which had to do with which people are receiving help under which programs they 're in bar one it was by program only so they said all the people you over yet but what I can tell you is it 's worked quite well so we didn 't get where there was no right on the first of July last year people knew when they were likely to be coming in so that had a letter and saying you know this is when you 're likely to come in so the same thing will happen here in the AC T probably the next time somebody from the agency comes to talk to a group like this we 'll be able to give you more detail at the moment all I can tell you is the phasing that 's how it 's referred to the phasing is still being decided and so that 'll be soonish yeah we 're very close to an agreement which is good waa also joins on the 1st of July this year that 's going to be very interesting because the WI government is running its own NDIS like trial it 's called my way but we will also be opening in the Perth Hills area of w-a on the 1st of July and in of people in this vast area called the Barclays region I mean it 's just huge peppered with tiny little remote indigenous communities so that is going to be quite a challenge but you can see all of those bits of experience if you put them all together what you 've got is something that should reflect diversity across the Australian landscape including how a scheme like this is possibly going to operate in a remote environment it 's going to be very challenging so the scheme did start on the 1st of July last year that was so exciting our CEO David Bowen said if I have to stand somewhere just with a balloon that says India nd I guess we are opening on the 1st of July but in fact everything that we hoped would happen on the 1st of july did things have been going quite well so this scheme is underpinned by developed developments that happened probably a year and a half ago almost now so there was a Council of Australian governments agreement in December 2012 that seems like an awful long time ago but across Australia saying yes we need this scheme and that of course came on the back of the productivity commission 's report saying this is something that Australia needs to move towards now bilaterals bilateral agreements between individual jurisdictions who were hosting a launch site and the Commonwealth Government was signed in April last year so you can see we 're in April now so it 's okay we haven 't quite finished our arrangements for the Oct yet and for those jurisdictions who have already agreed that they will proceed to full scheme rollout based on the learnings from the trial so that is at the moment every single jurisdiction in Australia except for W a so they 're the only ones who haven 't signed a heads of agreement for full scheme rollout so here in the acct in a sense we 'll be ahead of the pack because we 'll get to the end of our trial period but in fact everybody who needs to access the scheme will have done that and I 've mentioned those other arrangements in place the one thing I will say July in the trial sites last year we conducted a number of what we called site rehearsals where we actually bought people in who we suspected might be eligible kind of ran them through the process so it was a bit of a dry run to see how it all worked and that was tremendously instructive you can construct all your processes and say this is how it 's going to work but until you get real people in they 're actually doing the processes you don 't find out what could possibly go wrong and will be attempting to do that again this year so we might we 'll be in touch with you saying you know come and come and give us a run so I I belong to the National Disability Insurance Agency when we passed the legislation for the scheme so we are supported by a legislative base that give all of you some comfort I think so most programs are not necessarily supported by legislation the legislation tells us what we must do in what sort of time frame for whom and how and it itself and then underneath the rules set a set of citta set set aside I 'll just put my teeth back in sit a set of operational guidelines which are they 're much more detailed advice to our planners our local area coordinators people working with the agency about how this is going to operate in practice all of that material is available on our website so all of this is completely transparent and if any of you are looking for it you 'll find it very easily if you go to this section called about us and there 's a section called legislation NDIS rules and so on so our role apart from actually delivering the scheme that is bringing people in getting them planning finalizing plans connecting them to service providers getting them going is also about building community awareness of disabilities so we 're much more than fund holders planners administrators so in every launch site we 've got staff whose sole role so I like this phrase cause it 's French and I can 't_``_1261.1 speak French but raised on debt isn 't that a lovely with local communities so I I did that at a national level I 've now transferred to the ICT trial site where I get to do a little bit of it which is good but there is also a director of engagement that 's been recently employed who was in the ICT government so that 's a really good link her name is Alice Tibbits I don 't know if any of you know her already but from now until the end of June and Beyond she 'll be out there conducting public public forums just like this and there 'll be a series of those as we move towards launch we obviously have a key role and a key interest in ensuring the financial sustainability of the scheme in a sense that 's everybody 's response but there are people in the agency as I said in the actuarial unit whose absolute primary purpose is to make sure that things are running as well as they can this will be the first time by the time we get to full scheme rollout it will be the first time ever I 'm wrong in saying this where we have a single body of data about people with significant and permanent disabilities and the effect or the outcomes of the supports that they 're receiving on their on their lives so we 've started collecting that data then we have a database that 's collecting information about the people the over 4000 already who have come into the scheme and who have plans and we will continue to do this if any of you read even the executive summary of the productivity commission 's report one of the key pieces of feedback I had from people with disabilities their families and carers was that people hated having to repeat their story over and over and over and over and over and over so every time somebody went to a new provider it meant almost inevitably starting from scratch and people get very tired of that and so with this system we will collect that information from people once where they have bodies of information sitting sitting with other providers that they feel we need to have we can make arrangements to have it their story is there it is captured and then when they come in you know say they start off in the a CT and in three years time that person in the family decides to move to South Australia for example we will be able to just shift them across they 'll contact the agency their information is there they don 't have to start from scratch I mean this is one of the beauties of having something that will be enough your scheme it will be portable in the long term once we 've hit full scheme rollout and it will mean that person only needs to tell our story tell their story to us just one single time I will say how it because this is interesting we heard that information many times even when we were in the lead up to launch myself and a couple of people from my team went round to each of the launch sites to do some co.design sessions with families and people with disability and even there they were saying oh you know we get so tired of telling in for their first planning session they were very keen to tell us their story even if it was only going to be that one time and maybe it was with the knowledge that having told us just that one time they didn 't need to repeat the details again we will have a very strong role in developing enhancing the disability sector does anybody visit our website at least occasionally the NDIS website I 'd encourage you to do so so NDIS guru is the address the reason I 'm saying that is information is updated regularly and anything that 's new will appear on the carousel so there 's this shifting sort of set of headings up to the top right-hand side now there have been some capability regrets released just recently the funding has been announced for that so if any of you are working for a provider who think they might like to have a look at that that 's open for a month so I just encourage you to go and have a look at that it 's about building community capacity and capability about a disability service organisation and we will have a role in undertaking research so we haven 't quite commenced although we have commenced the arrangements for doing a formal evaluation because that 's really important but in the longer term the data that 's gathered is going to be this very very rich source of data for researchers both in the short in the long term so that 'll be very exciting too so progress to the end of February so this is pretty well up to date I don 't have much figures because March only if any yesterday we 've had 1 million three hundred thousand unique visitors to the website so that means in actual individuals which is very good we get around two and a half thousand visits to the website every single day more than 5,500 people have actually visited our shopfronts the seven that are open at the moment so these are people who didn 't have appointments these were people just coming in seeking information information or whatever more than seven and a half thousand access requests have been submitted so that 's scheme and I 'll talk a bit about that later over 5,000 plans have now been completed so we 're moving well towards the target for the first year which is to bring 9,000 people in and have them complete their plans so everybody 's expecting we will hit that target and very comfortingly to people who work for the agency the people who have come in and had their first or second or third planning session with the agency report a very high level of satisfaction with that interaction so we must be doing something right now this is a really important slide it looks very wordy but I 'll talk you through it this gives you an idea well not an idea it gives you a summary of how things are changing between the current arrangements and how things are going to be in the future and for the acct that 's the very near future which is good so on the Left you 've got access criteria in other words this is how people might access either a program or a source of funding or whatever under so even though you might have two very similar programs side by side the way that people got access to those could very enormous lis you know just this patchwork quilt of arrangements all the way across Australia very confusing and particularly difficult if you had a person moving from one jurisdiction to another under the NDIS there is one nationally consistent set of criteria that allows people to access the scheme and it 's set out in our legislation and then it 's supported by the NDIS rule and then also supported by our operational guidelines choice and control under the former system again this varied from state to state as I said you had pockets of people who were receiving individual support packages but that is the exception not the rule and so most people have very little say over the supports they receive under the NDIS the individual is at the center of this scheme absolutely the individual their carers and family sit right at the centre and they are the ones who have control over what they receive and how they receive it level a level programs there was often a cap on what people could receive but under this new scheme it 's absolutely demand driven and funding well I 've already talked about you know the thousands probably of individual programs identified need program a bit of money in flexibility you can only do this you know to so many people over a period of time that that will all be gone now so everything will be demand driven and fun oh sorry funding and so we 'll have this single funding pool called the NDIS and the more cash we roll into that so once programs come to the end of their life the money that would have been devoted to that program will roll into the NDIS and eventually we 'll just have a single funding pool for everybody who 's able to access the scheme I won 't go too much into this but there are principle principles and objects in the act they 're probably worth reading they give effect to Australia 's obligations under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of persons with disability and there are some into those most of these will be like yeah absolutely nobody will want to argue against them but this is where I wanted to get to so the primary aim of the scheme is to increase participation for people with disability in all spheres of life however that might look for an individual to whatever they can bring to the table you know to the extent that they are able to do it we want to increase their participation this is also consistent with our obligations under the UN Convention the scheme design actually assumes that people with disability will participate to the extent that they are able increased economic participation because I 'm sure all of you know a number of people with disability who would love to work if only there weren 't so many barriers if only they could get the support that they need and desire but increased economic participation for any person always translates to better long-term outcomes and the same is true of people with disability those higher participation rates as soon as you 've got people with disability much more visible out there about eventually that will deal permanently with the social constraints of disability the scheme is going to work very hard to ensure that other supports so beyond the disability specific supports that people need there are a whole host of other supports to which people with disability ought rightly to have access so I 'm talking about mainstream supports now transport accommodation health education all of those things everybody has a right to assistance under those schemes anywhere in Australia people with disability often have less access simply because there is either nobody to advocate that for them they don 't know how to navigate the system or the system says oh it 's too hard you know too hard is not going to be an excuse anymore so that 's a big chunk of our work making sure those systems work as well for people with disability as they do for people without and the scheme will fund all of the reasonable and necessary disability supports that a person does need to achieve that participation so when you 're thinking about what the intent a person 's plan is participation yep I 've talked about some of this already so I 'll just recap these are the three pillars that actually underpin the way that this scheme was designed so if you know about these things you have in your head really a framework for thinking about what this scheme is designed to do so there 's the insurance approach which shares the costs of supporting people with disability across the entire community who pays tax okay if you pay tax you are contributing to the scheme it 's not like a normal insurance scheme where you 're gone by a premium in a sense you are all paying your premium through the taxes you pay if any of you were kind of listening to what was happening in the lead-up to launch last year there was an amendment made to the Medicare Act which meant that the Medicare levy there 's a proportion of the Medicare levy which has gone up and that money is devoted wholly and solely to the NDIS funding so all of us are you know helping to support this in the event that future you just don 't know so choice and control I 've talked about that I don 't need to say that again but that 's in the middle and that 's in the middle for a very good reason and on the other side is community and mainstream so this sits within a philosophy that says people with disability are as entitled as anyone else to access community and mainstream supports so accessing the scheme this will be a big interest to you so once we know the phasing which is still a mystery to Sara and I but once we know the phasing the agency will write to and the oct government we may well as well write to people to let them know when they 're likely to come into the scheme so they 'll have a reasonable expectation about when they 're likely to be able to phase into the scheme now you might have a question about well what happens to them in the mean so there is a agreement between all governments who are participating in the trials that existing government programs or continuity they actually come in and are and have a plan so please don 't be concerned that if you have people who you are caring for who you think may well be eligible their support will not fall away on the 1st of July so arrangements will stay in place until individuals actually come into the scheme so how do you find out so this is a good question how do you find out if somebody might be eligible you can go onto our website right now probably Google lot on your phone if you want to go into our website right now and there is an electronic very simple form to fill in called my access checker so it 's been set up for a CT residents so you can go in have a look at that put in a few questions which really talks about the impact of a person 's disability on their daily functioning and at the end of that form which really literally only takes about five minutes to do because I did it for my son who has a permanent disability you will get might be able to access the scheme here 's your reference number and it 'll give you a five five digit and so a combination of numbers and letters reference number you need to keep that because that reference number attaches to the information that you have put in the electronic form and it will say please contact us after the 1st of July so the reason it says that is we don 't still know who is actually going to come in on the 1st of July but nevertheless it 's a useful exercise to go through so you know go on have a try even if you just make up a fictional person or somebody you 've worked with in the past you 'll get an idea of what that information is seeking yep but we have a wide gateway so how many of you had had experience in the past with programs that have had all these things that you need all these hoops you have to jump through before you even get to the front door so you know you have to have adopters these you know assessment this no no you guys actually a part of our front door I don 't know whether you knew that but anybody that you 're working with that you suspect may be eligible for the scheme you can refer them to the scheme you can sit with them and do the my access checker in your office or in their home if you want to if somebody is even just wanting to check to somebody to have kind of a preliminary discussion with somebody about what do I do you can do that so you actually are part of our front door and as such because you 're in direct contact with people with disability you are going to be very important in the scheme of things so ICT residents oh that says act residents I should say they see thing here and as I said before there 'll be a gradual intake you know just an orderly progression to make sure we bring everybody in in a timely way these are this is the skeleton the sort of core of what the disability requirements are so this the scheme and I 'm going to talk just about the acct now people will need to be aged under 65 so that 's really key they 'll need to be living residing in the a CT before or on the 1st of July so you can 't just move in and out you know on the 3rd of July and say I 'm here I think you 'll find most of your clients are already here anyway you have to have a permanent disability so we 'll come back to that in a minute because some of you might be wondering oh what about people with a psychiatric illness where they 're sick sometimes and not but I 'll talk about it in a minute so a permanent disability and the disability must have a significant impact on the way a person lives their everyday life so I 'll use my son as an example because he has a permanent disability he has something called Velo cardio facial syndrome we heard of that though most people have so it 's a chromosomal disorder but like many of those disorders very significantly impacted others like my son are more at the mild end his main effect as a mild intellectual disability and he for example has a terrible sense of direction among other things but he does need help with some things I doubt that he 's going to be able to access support under the scheme but it is permanent so it needs to have a big impact on your everyday life and your ability to participate and you are going to need supports for the rest of your life we 'll talk about early intervention in a minute because it does slightly alter the picture here because you can imagine if somebody has either been newly diagnosed has just at an accident or an injury that 's caused what 's likely to be a permanent disability by bringing in early intervention immediately you may be able to actually reduce the amount of support that somebody might need over their lifetime so that 's got a really important place in this scheme and in fact there are two ways if you like into the scheme there are people who a significant impact they will come in but people who have either been newly diagnosed or have newly acquired a disability can come in under the early intervention requirements I won 't go through that was pretty anything so so before I just get onto this I 'm just going to mention mental illness because mental illness is a mental illness can be significant and it can be permanent and perhaps some of you have clients that you help who maybe have a mental illness in the AC teets an area of particular interest I would say we 're interested in helping people where we can certainly they are included in the scheme but you would all be aware that for some significant mental illnesses or psychosocial disabilities it 's also called they are episodic so people certainly have a diagnosis that will stay with them for life but they may be ill for periods of time and then they 'll have a period of recovery where they are so ill so you know can the scheme manage this I 'm confident that we can the planning and assessment process at a point in their lives where they are not so ill but the skin gets to know them records them at a point where they are ill help could be activated very quickly and if you think about that in terms of other people who might have a progressive or degenerative disability so say motor neurone disease might be a good example so people 's needs for support are going to increase over time so there 's no cure for that and people generally will get worse over time as persons need increases for disability support they need only contact their planner and make a subsequent appointment and further supports can be arranged the scheme is designed to be that flexible for most people they will have a default review date of about 12 months this is where their disability is stable they pretty well know what they need etc but if anything happens before that 12 months is up people can just simply phone up yeah that 's right so it 's designed to be like that so this is the three chunks of the things that you concentration and emphasis on what people 's goals are so I don 't doubt that if you tried to have a conversation with some of your clients about goals they possibly wouldn 't know what you 're even talking about because people with disability who had to struggle so hard to get the support that they need that and often making do with much less than they need it 's very difficult for people to think beyond next week or next month this is a scheme that 's actually encouraging people to think about their long term goals and this is something that people with disability have a bit of trouble getting their heads around so we 're not just talking about your needs today or next week or next month what would you like to be doing in you next year or the year after in five years so the experience in the four trial sites today is that this has been the hardest thing for people to tackle it 's meant that plan completion rates have taken longer because people have needed time to think about their goals is a goal well it 's something achievable that you want that 's what a goal is but it has to be achievable and it has to be something that you want and so there 's been a bit of work going into our trial sites now with people who we know will come into the scheme to actually to get them to think about that in a bit more detail and so they 're a bit prepared when they come in to have their first planning conversation and there 's been some a bit of work sponsored by the ICT government around that very thing around helping people to think more carefully about what it is they want to do and we 'll continue to do that so with it each a lot of people who are coming in I don 't know how many more of those capacity building workshops yeah yeah that 's right and we 'll be looking at needs here in the AC T so again needs are varied across trial sites if you think about the South Australian context where we 've had very was quite difficult because parents are often dealing with the grief of having a newly diagnosed child there 's a lot lot often a lot of medical intervention that happens in those early days to get the child well and so it wasn 't the right time for them to be coming in and thinking about their child 's long-term goals or or even to be thinking about a plan they 're just you know dealing with the day to day the second part is the supports that people might already be receiving and these are the informal unpaid support so supports provided by community by mainstream by families carers relatives you know circles of support etc all of those get set out in the plan and then the third part is the actual NDIS funded supports and people will have a budget they 'll know exactly what they 're up for I won 't say much more about this except these are really important you know these are really important it goes back to that point I was trying to make before about you know this is everybody 's everybody 's responsibility and in terms of carers because I 'm sure many of you will also be connected with families and carers of people with disability they have often borne the brunt of supporting that person often over a lifetime we know we 've got quite a lot of elderly carers in the AC who are very concerned about what this scheme is going to mean for their child their son or daughter and there is a component of the planning where parents can have a separate conversation with the planner so although the intent is always to involve the person with disability and everything and nothing out nothing about us without us I think is what they say but there obviously will be a place for planners to have a separate conversation with carers or parents if that 's appropriate we want to make sure that carers are supported in their in their role and so while we wouldn 't directly fund a carer for you know X or Y we can sir put supports in a plan that will make sure that carers get a break from in the past I don 't know why that terms necessarily fallen out of favour but nobody seems to like it anymore I mean in many cases that can be a break for the person with disability as well as the the parent or carer but those kind of breaks but the other thing it can include is referral to other agencies for support outside the ndia and it can also include paying for training courses so there obviously will be a place for carers needing to do X or Y to increase their capacity to care for the person and the NDI can pay for that that 's not the extent of it you can read about that rule on the NDIS website so learning is going to be absolutely crucial so we like to think of ourselves as a learning organization you know learning that 's based on experience will absolutely lead to improvement I think that 's the only way we can do it we 're very open to feedback so at the moment we 've got several mechanisms that people can use to give us feedback receiving feedback from their participants from carers from family from the general public as well as us having a national way of collecting that we have a 1-800 number that operates every day of the week except oh not Saturdays and Sundays sorry why shouldn 't to you operates every day but I think it 's 8 to 8 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. to take into account the W a trial sites starting in July you can ring them up and give them feedback there are complaints forms on the on the website that you can fill in if you 've got a complaint and if you 've got something nice to say of course we 'd like to hear about that too so this is really important for you I 'm not sure to the about the extent to which the acct will necessarily reflect this experience from our existing trial sites because based on the feedback and the early trends from the first six months of operation we 've made some adjustments already to our processes and systems to make things easier so clearly expectations about the they are high everywhere not just in the disability community but in the community generally I think and this is another area where support workers are going to be just so important so you have direct access to people who are likely to enter the scheme managing people 's expectations is going to be really important so by educating yourself about the scheme by knowing that it 's permanent disability that has a significant impact that it 's about increasing participation it 's not about going to the moon it 's about increasing participation in the community you will help to manage expectations for scheme participants we 've had a lot more access requests come in than we anticipated and the time taken to finalize plans has been longer than expected and that 's going back to those complicating factors like in South Australia but mainly it has been around the fact that people have needed much much longer to think about their goals and to unpack their goals and the number of people entering the scheme at least up until the end of December was lower than expected but pickup in the number of plans being completed and both participants and staff eventually identified a number of areas where things could have been improved and in fact those improvements have been made so to be successful these are the things that we and I mean collectively we the Royal way that 's everybody needs to keep in mind those three pillars need to be kept in balance the insurance approach choice and control community and mainstream we need to ensure that the funding for the scheme is sustainable so there 's been a funding envelope identified by the time we get to full scheme rollout which is 22 billion dollars a year it 's a lot of money you could have a lot of trips to Disneyland for that but it is a lot of money it 's about a doubling of what currently goes into the disability sector now so certainly there will be a lot more funding available and that 's good news but it also means that we need to keep an eye on making sure we 're delivering the scheme within that funding envelope and need to make sure that the delivery is efficient and effective and again you know in the acct we might come up against things that we haven 't already uncovered in the existing trial sites and be able to make improvements here that means that the process is even more streamlined for people with disability I certainly hope so and it has to improve outcomes it has to if it doesn 't we 've all failed you know we 've all failed so this is what 's happened so far has been a stronger emphasis on the evidence-based approach for change we 've streamlined the process for determining whether somebody might be able to access the scheme and that 's made a big difference there 's much better guidance for our decision makers so in terms of who are the decision-makers in the agency about what a person gets and so on it 's our planners so we have people who have the delegated authority from the CEO to make decisions about what somebody can have in their plan much better communication I hope with the community so that they streamlining our admin and plan implementation to reduce the burden on ndia staff we 're building sector capacity I won 't go into all of this you can find it on the website we ran around called practical design fund in at the beginning I think of end of 2012 and all of the projects that have been finalized you can find them on the website if you 're interested to see what they came up with we had a conference last year that 's old news got nearly a year ago and sector development fund and this is where the capacity building strategy grants come in so I mentioned them earlier worth going on the website to have a look at those and transition will be gradual so there 'll be this gradual transition I 'm not exactly sure how sort of like a magic box at the moment but just to reassure you next time we come back we 'll be able to tell you all about that wide gateway so I mentioned the web the call center the 1-800 number the shop fronts anybody can turn up the doors open on the 1st of July here you 're very welcome just to come in and visit us there are information products being developed now for our ICT audiences and we don 't just print them in hardcopy everything also goes up on the word web so if you were ever looking for a copy of something you could just go to the web and print one off from there we 'll have products going out to our prospective participants once our phasing is known and we are working on a planning in a plan implementation kit for people who become participants in the scheme um there 's still quite a bit of work to do I try not to think about it just just get through today it 'll be fine but as I said before there 'll be a continual rolling program of community engagement so just look out for that again it 'll all be on the website the schedules if any of you are signed up to the newsletter so it 's free an electronic newsletter if you haven 't go to our website movement of national office staff from Canberra to Geelong by the end of June so obviously the acct trial site staff is staying here because we need to be on the ground but almost everybody else is going to national office in Geelong we 're preparing for that formal evaluation an external independently conducted evaluation of the scheme that we 'll be starting soon and this is part of our preparation of people in organisations in the acct for 2014 and that 's probably as much as I wanted to say I could keep going but you know you might have some questions _"

    "text": "thank you very much rosemary and good afternoon colleagues I understand that we 're live-streaming this event today so also want to say hello to all of those colleagues that are out in other parts of the acct and for that matter australia robert even tells me there 's some people listening in from indonesia so i hope that they 're getting some value out of today 's discussion can I also acknowledge that we 're meeting on the land of traditional custodians and honorable people and pay my respects to their elders past and present and can I also pay my respects to any Aboriginal Torres Strait Islander people that are with us today I I 'm really going to talk about context there 's been a lot of discussion this morning on what I call the broader bigger picture context and I 'm leading into Roberts presentation bringing us back to the community sector development program and going to build a bridge between that broader sector context and what Robert has to talk about first of all can I just recap though of course most of the discussion on our the environment in which we find ourselves operating and this context is one that 's characterized by our mission to reduce the demand for all of our services and an increase the outcomes that we 're achieving for the most vulnerable people in Canberra the other important context which has been spoken about a lot today is the National Disability Insurance Scheme but most particularly because it 's such a fundamental reform in service delivery relationships and the infrastructure that will support service delivery if you like the person 's centeredness about NDIS is going to be driven very strongly by the changing nature of the financial relationship that exists between the consumer of those services and the providers of those services that 's going in my view change the shape of this sector in the acct I know Minister bar said this morning that we 're into a trial we 're not yet sure how it will pan out he 's not willing to predict the impact that that will have on broader community sector but in my view I don 't think there 's any going of that financial relationship we will see change and we 'll learn from that and that learning will be imported into the rest of the sector and of course the disability sector makes up about a third of our sector investment here in the acct so it 's so material it is very unlikely not to have an impact right across the board we also know that many of you are providing services to people with a disability and others so it 's not just something that 's going to have an effect on specialist disability providers because many of you many of you do support people with a disability the other of course is the financial landscape and I won 't dwell on that for too long you know every year you hear the story of my staff told me this oh yes every budget it 's going to be a tough budget yes yes we have to find savings we need to reduce expenditure we do have to cut back but there are just too many indicators of change in the financial environment that suggests this year is you some of the initiatives that we 've been discussing with government in the context of the budget would essentially wipe out the available expenditure for government across the board so it is that it is that serious I also wanted to touch on a question that the minister received this morning in fact i think it was Simon that asked at Simon Rosenberg about what 's government doing in the context of this change all of those environmental issues that I talked about that influence the landscape in which we 're operating are real to the community services Directorate as they are real to you how will we look in two to three years time I think probably the best indicator for that for any of you at the moment would be to go and have a look at the Human Service blueprint I 'll come back to that because it goes to the theme of context that I want to speak about today but that blueprint is in fact an investment blueprint that 's the way it 's been prepared by us collectively and we 've put it for the future service delivery system so if you want to have a look at how we might look particularly my Directorate might look in the next two to three years go and have a look at that blueprint and we 'll review some good indicators and some good clues about how things are likely to change into the future so the government is reforming its approach and we are looking right across the board in every arm of the work that we do to redress the way that we deliver services I know the minister also spoke about one acct we talked about one CSD as maybe a good start in that direction and again this community sector development program is going to drive a lot of change in that area but but in particular again the blueprint will give you some clues as to how a one CSD are one community service director at a government arm of the community services might look into the future with the focus on improved access for Universal Services a genuinely integrated early intervention and prevention platform and a more evidence-based approach children youth and family services of disability arm housing arm and a policy and general community development arm I think you 'll see those things starting to change but let me come back to our community sector development program and in terms of the context there what I what I really wanted to talk about today was relationships and talked about that at a very local level when the government when we went to the government in December last year with a package of procurement contracting and reporting reforms the very first heading in the discussion paper which is available publicly was the introduction the next one after that was be in no doubt this is about relationships so that 's the second emphasis I want to put on today about context this heading is what this heading is what it is because regardless of the procedural nature of say red tape reforms or the sometimes prosaic nature of a sector development program and regardless of how the human service blueprint will end up changing how we deliver services regardless of all these things there has to be a relationship know we all want that relationship has to be strong and must have high levels of trust and confidence between the parties I think that we are very lucky here in the acct having worked in the Australian Government you know I think it 's pretty amazing that we had the Minister for Community Services come along this morning not only deliver the keynote address but then stay for some time and ask questions when I used to work in a department who shall remain nameless we couldn 't even we couldn 't even get the secretary to come and meet with the peak bodies that were the major stakeholders in the work that we do the work that we did and we often invited the ministers advisors along because we would never get the minister and they more often than not only on the day didn 't turn up because there are other in more important priorities that they needed to address so in that respect I 'm I think we have already very strong relationships I know we want more we want a sense of a stronger depth got a very very good platform to work on here in the acct so this is a relationship that we can never cease working on of course and I 'll never claimed that we 're there yet it 's far too important to ever relax about these sorts of things but I do think that we are making progress and the context that I want to put the sector development program into along with the number of the other reforms that have mentioned and that are happening at the moment is this relationship context this slide which I think they will bring up in a moment looks like there 's a slide about to come up which just really has a list of some key initiatives that are going on right now and are affecting us right here and now in the acct government and during the community sector you 'll see the next slide please the wrong slide doesn 't matter just listen come back and listen to me don 't worry about those slides there are distraction anyway aren 't they so the list of the initiatives that the sector reform program which we 've launched today the human service blueprint the National Disability Insurance Scheme implementation homelessness reforms the Gateway project strengthening families and through care I could also add the youth services blueprint and there 's some interesting work coming out of health now in relation to childhood health development and of course the work we 've done on child protection with the out-of-home care sector I mentioned these in particular because some of them are willing to delivery mode some uh still at the very early stages or in the planning process but all of them characterize this notion of the relationships that I think characterized the strengths of the acct community every one of those elements of those initiatives have in my view I think set a new standard for the way in which we are working with the community sector and since I arrived three years ago I think we have followed up very genuinely with our intent to involve you early in discussions about policy development process and take take the collaborative approach to presenting issues back to government I think many open and engaged with you in the way in which we are informing government around the work that we 're doing with you what that feedback has been how we 're moving that into a budgetary context and what role we expect ourselves respectively to play as we as we move through I think we still can get better at that and I know that we will continue to learn from those experiences but the quality of input that 's come through those collaborative approaches has been second to none in my view what does the development of these programs say about a relationships well Minister bar noted that the governance and financial management model of the sector development programme commenced delivery in October last year we 've had some feedback from 20 organizations that have participated so far in that module we did have those up on a slide too but let me just tell you that the the comments that were on that slide we 're essentially going to the cross-section of views which were by and large very positive about the nature of that engagement through that congratulate ourselves necessarily on that good program but to concentrate on the partnership that developed it because it 's a partnership that is the reason that it 's a very good program this module like all of the modules in the development program was developed in conjunction with the community sector reform advisory group more arm affectionately known as CS rag our team and a panel of consultants it was through this type of partnership and the preparedness by us in government to resist the temptation to control it too tightly I hope you concur with that view that is resulted in something so beneficial Minister barmaid also some comments about the importance of the government playing its role in removing impediments from your path the important thing in the reforms shown it was on a slide I haven 't got my slides up here with me Robert but the the more important thing in the reforms that were shown in this slide that relate to removing impediments in your path which is about our red tape reduction program is that these reforms were developed again by the community sector and you returned the courtesy not just by proposing some more but by treating the process very seriously the result was that all the recommendations were accepted and in fact I 'm now in a process within the governance of my Directorate of pulling people into responsibility for implementing each one of those particular particular recommendations relating very directly to contract arrangements reporting Arrangements financial arrangements and so on to bring those into effect for your information the cs rag agreed last Thursday that as these reforms are implemented they 'll provide an operational perspective to make sure good intentions are reflected in good process in other words they 're going to keep us bloody well honest about it I 'm very excited about those reforms because again it 's about this point about infrastructure that will assist in accelerating this shift and this change in the way that government presents itself to the community sector and and I know that you have a strong voice and you will most certainly keep us honest finally the development of the human service blueprint also represents a sharing of working together of design team and also through an intensive design workshop we trialed some different methodologies as well as having a number of community sector leaders participate in a steering group with Director General 's from across across government in that particular program we use time to talk as a way of opportunity providing opportunity for more people that wanted to stay engaged and get involved to do so that particular process worked very effectively and I can remember very distinctly having a conversation with some of you in this room about the pace at which we were forcing that process a very important one where we 'd agreed again a number of us sitting around a table some 12 months ago that we had to stop talking about integrated service to and do something about it we needed to have a shared vision of what we wanted the human service system in the acct to look like and I knew that if we took what we normally take is more than 12 months to have a conversation like that to collaborate in an ex what excuse me for saying this but T and dotting every I we 'd missed the budget process which started last November is really coming to conclusion about now as we move into just the final finessing of the budget that will be announced in June so we had no choice or we 'd lose another year we had to do something quickly and we had to be confident enough that we would retain some integrity in the collaborative approach and and then I guess make up for lost ground as we moved into implementation so people came with us on that approach said okay let 's let 's do this and I know at every meeting it was again something people were very concerned about how we given each and each part of this the appropriate consideration where did we have the right to represent the whole community sector with our views on this issue had we consulted widely enough had we engaged clients and so on well we kept bringing ourselves back to we know what we have to achieve we 've been talking about it for years we 've done numerous surveys of clients we didn 't already know we used I think a group of very motivated and experienced frontline workers on the core design team and we workshopped a lot of their thinking in a two day intensive conference style process workshop style process we delivered I think an amazing piece of work articulating what a single human service system should and could look like we 've been able to get that into government through cabinet now ready for budget consideration and that 's something that I 'm not at liberty to talk to you about today but stay tuned you 'll hear about it very shortly and again I say if you want to see what will look like in two or three years time go and have a look at that that document I suspect it 's what you will look like to because it 's going to end dry drive the investment that government will make into the things that matter within the sector and so it 's a very important piece of work and one will come back to another day and spend the appropriate amount of time David Crosby about the importance of being clear about your mission and sticking to it you 've heard rosemary talk about building on your strengths and being very good at what you do I didn 't hear Miranda 's presentation but I 'm just picked up a few comments as I arrived that she exposed the lived experience of change and reform and getting ready for major reform and many people conveyed to me that they really appreciated those insights you 've heard from Minister bar about I talked about responsibility in government and put the interests of clients first I 'm convinced that this work will accelerate many of the themes that have progressed today the common purpose the shared vision playing to our strengths the integrity of values and being clear about what they are and and making sure that we as each organization are dear to our values respecting our interdependencies by that I mean not only between government and the sector but within the sector itself having real clarity about roles and that 's something I think we 'll all struggle with as we move through for government what 's the right role for the sector or different parts of the sector but all of it will be about focusing on getting a good good and better outcomes for all of our clients I believe that all these messages are consistent and that working together is the way that we deliver what we all agree on none of this is easy for any of us and I 'm sure that will make mistakes along the way but I 'm also confident that our successes will outweigh the mistakes and I 'm looking forward to hearing more of the positive feedback from the sector development program as it rolls out over the next 18 months reform is most certainly upon us I think it 's going to be a very exciting period of maturity for all of us that work in this sector I think we will work together I think we can and we have demonstrated that we can work together very effectively and in fact we must work together thank you _"

    "text": "so what next that 's a really great question I think what 's clear is change is inevitable from all the speakers today it 's fast-paced is what 's also very clear we as leaders have to think differently that message has been sent over and over again and I 'm going to use an example so my background is accounting I 'm a bank Anna and I worked for 10 years counting beans and during that process i charged my time so i was valued based on how much time i charged and how productive i was over eighty percent i had a smiley face under eighty percent sad face a very different world to the world i work in now and that 's how my brain works I think of every minute as has a dollar attached to it um it 's ingrained in me I was asked to speak today and tongue in cheek as it was when I talk about thinking differently I ask the question how much will you pay me because as CEOs of organizations and leaders we have to start to put a we 're valuable we have to say we 're leaders and we have to ask because our time is valuable and the work we do is valuable it impacts on so many people in the community so one vision and i 'll talk about NDIS but we talk about one human services model as well it 's clear it 's happening it 's about providing a quality cost efficient effective service for the people in our community it 's about being price competitive and it 's about ensuring and maximizing that every dollar we have goes to service delivery that 's a shift it 's a pretty big shift for all of us so what are the challenges I could probably stand up here and break down the detail of those challenges map out how you transition and how you transform but that 's what this support and the sector development programs here to do but I wanted to talk honestly and openly about the challenges we all face I think in its most basic sense the current economy and the icing to acct environment highest average earnings commonwealth government 's happening right now it 's a big change in our contract requirements so I explain this to my board of directors and I get it quite clearly because their risk is increased previously six million dollars of revenue half Commonwealth half acct three years recurrent paid in advance cash flows easy secure revenue everything 's there our contracts didn 't require us to be businesses they simply didn 't they required us to put people first and report on outputs the new world requires us a unique challenge and that is to balance a human service community model because that doesn 't go away we 're about people with a business model reporting on outputs and outcomes for people that wasn 't ever expected before so those things have changed so actually funnily enough five years ago today I took the job as CEO of Kamari and at that that week I said so what 's the data so we 're going to start to plan this organization and work out who we are and what we 're doing what does the market look like what are our customers a business world you work out the scope of your market what it looks like do we have a place in it do our services have a place in it it 's hard to do when there isn 't the data to support that Jillian spoke about that collation and collection and getting it right that 's a challenge for us because it 's about where we target our efforts and how we ensure people are at the center of those so the other thing is the right people the right workforce that also has an ICT context highest average earnings competing with Commonwealth and government so how do we make sure that we have the right skills in our leadership the right workforce to underpin that with a clear direction when in lots of ways the pay that we 've had in the past and the history of our organizations is built on passion but built on a low wage I don 't think I need to go on that paints a pretty large picture of the challenges we face we have a very big road ahead of us is the speed and the magnitude of the change for different areas it 's different what we know is in the disability sector I could probably put on days or months or so so it 's significant so I talked about these in the context and go bank got a new workforce excellent know how to be a business great everyone 's on board doesn 't work like that by old 1950s house and you want it to be energy efficient got to spend some money but I get the right people it 's it 's a real challenge if your purpose built you 've already got all those things you 're facing the right direction you 've got double glazed windows it 's already there so we do have challenges and time and expectation is one of them what stands out is are the people we support also a part of this actually they 're the whole reason why we 're here so they have to be built in as part of the exchange and ensure that no one 's put at risk so how do we do it I walked over thought whole run you through a better practice business model of how you transition and run you through the eight seven steps everyone has a couple of different steps but that 's not what it 's about it 's about a really large understanding of what it means for us as leaders in 2012 kamari undertook a review in preparedness for being a better practice organization with the NDIS in mind wow I submitted it to my board of directors and they said game on I said yeah well I 'm not sure we 're even sustainable in the long term why don 't know why we 're a non-diversified medium-sized specialist disability service provider we don 't have a fundraising we don 't have different arms of our business that reduce the risk and exposure we run for businesses that employ 182 people that aren 't sustainable without government funding oh good glad i bought the 1950s house and we got to do some work so we began our map we began our three-year strategy to moving to being a better practice model the gaps that about them today the first was we didn 't really understand our market we didn 't really understand our customers in fact our model meant people rocked up we said oh we 've got a gap we 've got a space we can support you or we don 't sorry too hi hey going what can I do for you that change is significant what can I do for you which is fantastic but is a different way of thinking we couldn 't and can 't compete on price because of our size because our overheads maintaining our quality standards maintaining the appropriate work for standards simply don 't allow us to compete I look in the trial sites I see a price released I say oh good how does our model need to look we didn 't have the right organizational structures the right skills in our in house in our house because it feels like my house to do this we just don 't we haven 't invested in our workforce because actually we 're not for profit when we make a surplus it goes back we don whole model was built on a different thought we don 't have the business systems that I had when I worked in an accounting firm client management systems timesheets reporting efficient and effective systems to make sure that every dollar we had goes to service delivery we didn 't have that because it wasn 't seen as a priority so that magnitude of that shift in two years just put it out there it 's a big shift I I know that this is the right move for organizations such as ours because when I came in to this role I was naive I was that kid who said game on my background and I what I do know is through reviewing our processes systems and everything else we can do this better more hours of service delivery do you know what I didn 't understand the people part like simply didn 't_''_714.81 I couldn 't couldn 't grasp it five years later that 's a core part being built into our transformation that person first approach means we will never compete with a business model that doesn 't put sure people come first it 's built in our strategy it 's built on how I report to the board so when we talk about values David spoke about values being built in they 're built into our business rules have I learnt a lot yes we 're in year two of our transformation an example previously I used to get my hair done and colored every eight weeks now it 's gray on the sides and up here I go every six weeks puts more money like my budgets larger now it 's um it 's been significant but it 's been fantastic in the last six months we 've seen some great outcomes to the people we support because we 're thinking differently I 'm not saying we 've got it right I 'm not saying we 've got it perfect actually in fact the next 12 months for us is make or break it is make or break and I believe in it I 'm committed to doing it and I 'm committed to the 270 people we support getting a better service so what do I to embrace it we need to put the people we support at the center of it we need to maximize the opportunities we 're getting through this community sector development program because we don 't have those resources in house sometimes we don 't have those dollars and every dollar given their means more dollars in our service the people we have in our organization at the skills the leadership without that we 've got nothing I think the challenge for us as we head in and we have new competitors come into the market is balancing the Human Services approach with a business model because they 're not separate we 're not choosing to be businesses now we want to succeed and make sure no one falls through the gaps and more service goes to more people then we have to put them together and that 's not a simple business model we as organizations in this sector have to work together in fact Minster bar mentioned that some people won 't make it that 's true we have to partner we have to think about how we can each other services it may mean that the areas we worked in before someone else does really well that 's okay and maybe we work better together on those things my accounting brain says and it 's cheaper which means more service hours that 's how we 've got to think mr. Barr spoke about that gap it becomes our responsibility if we 're efficient and effective will never be able to fill the gap but at least we can make sure people aren 't at risk have a clear picture of who your organization is what are you good at are you a generalist I use this example and I think my staff is sick of it you would take away who does pizzas hamburgers everything else or are you a gourmet pizza provider and you understand who your market is what they like what they don 't like and can you do it and produce it package it the way they want to see it know who you are because that out said if you don 't know that it 's a real challenge your specialist your generalist today other than say the positive change for individuals we support is is is a real opportunity and we should take it but we should talk to each other and work together thank you you _"

    "text": "a good morning everybody I always feel after lunch is hard after our ministers always interesting and I said to Andrew as he left I don 't think the acnc is dead just yet so hopefully we can still keep some of the reforms that have benefited the sector I want to start by acknowledging the traditional owners of the land where we meet I want to thank Natalie and Robert and others for today on I think this is a pretty important kind of meeting because not many jurisdictions are actually engaging in the way that I see happening here and although some of the conversations can be a bit uncomfortable in at some level I think it 's very important to have those conversations because one of the things I find is that as a sector we tend to be so busy achieving our goals serving our clients in our community that we really don 't put our future in our entry to the degree that perhaps we should so I 'm going to run very quickly through the CCA some trends and talk to you about where let me start very quickly by this is what am I going the right way go backwards but ok so that 's where I work the community council for Australia its peak body it represents the not-for-profit sector it 's the first time we 've had a peak body across the sector and that 's my board just to give you a sense of who 's involved in that organization I 'd encourage you all to join become part of it in the discussions and things that we have but I think one of the things we as a sector need to recognize is that we haven 't operated much as a sector so despite where we are and our role in our community I don 't think we 've taken a very a very effective position and strengthened our sector so having done the CCA stuff really quickly let me go into where we are we 've been very fortunate in some ways as a sector we 've been growing faster than any other sector except the mining industry over the past decade and in fact our turnovers gone than six years so most of us most of the people sitting in this room has seen an increase in their income and an increase in their capacity to do things and you know generally we 've had a pretty good time of it in some ways that 's a real problem and we 'll get to that in a minute but I remember when when I first took over the role at CCA we tried to get a Senate acquire we actually got upper sent an inquiry into future funding of the not-for-profit sector and because we thought that was one of the most important agendas we helped write the terms of reference had the Senate South inquiry if this has been the future financing of an industry a quarter of our size like the tourism industry or communications or primary industry you would have had hundreds if not thousands of submissions guess how many we had 27 and three of those were from me 11 as CCA and two in my written articles for the Canberra Times and the secretary of the committee wanted to quote from them our impact on the community we really haven 't in a very effective evil or strong advocacy group we 've already heard a lot about government trends and i think andruw 's rape lay them out pretty clearly but I just thought I very quickly talk about some of the implications for that than happening around Australia obviously people want to not just have government money going to things but we 're possible attract other sorts of money and look at paying a dividend on the savings the government back to investors and that kind of model is starting to be rolled out in a number of places in a number of different ways the whole concept of attracting new money is usually associated with scale with size with people being able to join together it 's very hard to get sponsorship for one school but getting sponsorship for 30 schools is a bit easier because of the way scale works in terms of investment thinking there 's a lot of place based you know what 's happening in this area was talking to Natalie before about the the growing say look what 's happening here and they overlay all these variables the most impressive one I saw recently was they overlaid how far people had to walk to get to a grocery store in a part of us they overlaid that against diabetes and obesity and found a very strong correlation so the he was Arkansas government actually sponsored a few supermarkets to open and very significantly reduced obesity diabetes and increased school attendance by making walkability how far to walk to get to fresh food different measure so people are looking more how do we get a return on our investment what 's actually happening with this population group you know the days of you know there 's some kind of problem out here people are injecting on the street out here we should do something about that let 's have an anti injecting in front of the press club program you know we would lobby government to get it up and then you know we have the anti injecting in front of the press club grant program of a hundred grand a year we all right submissions to the hundred grand you run the program for a while and then you write the project depa Tar Heel eyes the we did good program it too good for a while and it exists no more but it was good while it lasted and you know there 's a lot of that kind of pattern in our history there 's going to be less of that kind of pattern in our future for because of these reasons governments have less money now that kind of responding to issues in that way you know now governments would say well who else who invests in those people what other programs that we have why aren 't they at school why aren 't they in the the various treatment programs or whatever they should be in I don 't know that I did that but it came up can we stop that I 'm not actually touching this busy um I wanted to have what am i doing wrong oh okay that helps but I still wasn 't touching it I wanted to talk about what I see is a really important don 't know I 'm know I 'm getting older but increasingly when i watch television and things like that and i look at the best communicators in the world I wonder what the bloody hell they 're communicating because I watch these ads and I don 't know what the product is you know there 's people hugging each other or and it 's a health or people learning to play the piano it 's a bank and you know it makes no sense to me what they were doing and I 'd be looking at these ads and hear what are they doing and then I realize what they 're actually doing is trying to lay out a set of values that we can align ourselves to and this has gone to what I consider to be extraordinary lengths and I could have shown you any number of these you know I think the best social inclusion and I 've ever seen is the vb ad where they say what banner do you march under and they have all these different banners half of which i think i of people that are too attractive or people that are a gay and people that are streakers and people that are brewers and people dancing you know and you can make up your own banner and go on the website and make up your own that David Crosby been a you know and you can form a group and it 's we all belong because we 're all having a beer and you know if I say to you let 's go have a beer what does it mean there 's a set of values associated with that that sense of irreverence fun relax don 't take yourself too seriously it 's not an accident that happens around that product because that 's part of what we 've created this whole notion of values like has gone to an extremely I thought I 'd give you just one example now let 's see if this works there 's no sound doesn 't matter we don 't we then that really made the sound thought this creepy and easy I should really play something that isn 't it no backing I made this ad so so he 's come home late he 's been out graffitiing the music 's all sad and he 's got this sister that 's really sick so the mother says thank you pfizer who got that and you 've got to imagine there was swelling music and beautiful emotional stuff hopefully the next day we can get the sound to work on but you know fires are probably one of the worst companies in the US for you know miss representing their drugs creating diseases for their drugs and behaving in a really inappropriate way and they 're doing this it 's takes long and you know if I look at some of these ads I 'm just I can 't believe that the people making the ads are actually the companies that they are so why are they doing it these are the best minds in our world creating this kind of communication the skilling that 's phenomenal they 're doing it the same reason that when you and I walk into any service what do we do when we look around what are we if I walk into a primary school doesn 't matter what if I walk into a farm school and I look around what am I reading I 'm looking at how people are interacting I 'm looking at whether you know when the teacher comes out does she bend down or squat down with the kids do the kids come close or a move away the kids look as though they 're in trouble when the teacher starts to talk to them or they gather around and think it 's fantastic I 'm reading it i 'm reading the values that are being enacted is there these kinds of things so yeah that 's just yeah maybe it 's a delay when I walk into any service whether it 's aged care mental health or alcohol and drugs and you know run programs in all those areas run agencies in those areas I look at what 's happening and what 's happening for me is about are these values there and the reason I work in this sector and the reason I believe in this sector is not because it in those values and I want to see those values enacted you know I would worry and Jewish servcorp gets a lot of your contracts because I 'm not sure about the values that are being enacted in some of its services I look for values in organizations and I see values as part of what we should be measuring and talking about often we don 't too often we don 't oh that 's already there I didn 't do that who 's who said that ah hi I didn 't know you were doing it you should have told me I 'll wave to you okay what what worries me about our sector is this that as we 've grown we 're grown quite quickly remember many of us have grown in a way that most businesses would would see as remarkable we 've started to take on some of these kinds of traits in some organizations so I could talk about some of the organization 's I 've been because Rose we mentioned Odyssey house in Melbourne odyssey 's a very big treatment service over a hundred in the community a hundred bed residential longer term treatment program a farm all these other things when I got there I did what all new CEOs to you know I did a kind of review where we were and when I got the senior staff and some of the board together to talk about the outcome of my review this was two thousand when I first got there but 350 heroin deaths in Melbourne net here will meant to be dealing with most of the heroin treatment in Victoria and quite a few of those heroin deaths were asian young men in their 20s we didn 't have one asian client in the 5,000 clients that I checked not one and I said to them how come we don 't have any Asian clients now it wasn 't the only thing I raised but it was one of the points on here how come we don 't have any Asian coins and you know what they said they don 't come and you know Dave we 're not going to go looking for business there are waiting list for get extra people in you know people die on our waiting list via what were we going to do and the whole notion that they were there to serve a community and respond to an issue had been lost in the notion that they were Stand and Deliver program providers this is what we do they come or they don 't are we serving our community well why would you ask that question our programs are fool we get money increasingly what I see is people are disconnected from their purpose from their core values I won 't go through what we do about that but suffice to say we outpaced the quick summary is we are based some staff in places where there were large populations of Asian people including the Buddhist temple in footscray and ended up with a lot of Asian drugs but what I see too often in our sector is a kind of stand and deliver mentality what do we do we run our programs that 's what we do and we 've got to get more money to run our programs why because people how could it be done better if someone took away all that program funding all of it and said to you I want you to address this issue would you do what you do now would you do it the way you do it what would you do it differently would you start at a different point if you didn 't have to have a unit price or a unit cost it 's not I 'm not trying to have a go at people because what we 've done is respond to the environment in which we are operating in order to offer new programs and new services when we could see needs we often had to fit them into boxes of service delivery in unit prices and things like that but there comes a time I think when we have to think go back to our purpose so good see that that worked there 's no sound again so I know why we 've gotten those sound you 're fixing it okay and there 's a guy up there you think I 'm talking to myself but there 's doesn 't matter i can do the voices okay so they 're going up an escalator and then the escalator stops with a real shot you should have heard that was a real shutter and they 're upset she says I this is this is terrible i 'm going to be late for my meeting he says don 't worry well something will happen well then they 're looking for their phones they realized their only desk what are they going to do they calling out help and he 's saying we 're stuck on an escalator well someone come and help us and and she 's being really common in she freaks and just screams and you can see they 're showing shots of stairs everywhere I don 't know why they 're doing it and then you know he 's complaining what it will mean for his day stuck on this bloody escalator and and then he says well you know I guess there 's not much to do but wait till help comes and then help arrives and he 's really happy he 's here to fix do his voice that you 're fantastic voice and then guess what happens it 's glad to get stuck I think we 've been on an escalator as a sector and our capacity to think differently about how we move forward is really challenging and it 's it 's something that we haven 't had to do because just doing good work was enough doing good work was enough you got your funding again write a few submissions you know the money came that time is changing so next I probably should stop doing this um when we when we as CCA went around and talked to CEOs in Brisbane Melbourne Sydney Adelaide about where they saw the future and what the issues were we were thinking well if the sector won 't put its future in its in Drey maybe we need to start looking at how we do that yeah how do we talk about the future for our sector and what are the issues in our future so after quite a bit of consultation actually supported by pricewaterhousecoopers pwc as we have to call them now these see some of whom have done remarkable work as Simon Rosenberg was saying before government needs to rethink the way it invests in the sector it 's really interesting to me if I invest in the stock market not that I do I 'm very really not sure that I 've actually got any shares my wife has not sure what they 're in but if we if we invest in the stock market what do we do what do we look at where you look at the the kind of management team that they have their past record you look at who else is invested you look at the price earnings return you look at their business model are there potential competitors what 's their unique positioning compared to their competitors and if all those things are right and the earnings look solid then and there well capitalized then you might invest I 've never been asked those questions is a not-for-profit I 've never been asked about my capital reserves I 've never been asked about my management team in their experience I 've never been asked about function I 've never been asked if I 've done this before in other organizations you know we write the pretty submissions or proposals and the government says that 's the prettiest one day you can have 100 person you wrote a really nice submission and you know I don 't like that and the government needs to and other funders need to think again about how we invest and increasingly we need to look at our access to capital it has to be outside of government increasingly whether we like it or not because government is under the pump revenue increases whose governments had the same thing in 10 an increasing revenue stream oh well it 's leveled out hasn 't gone backwards but it 's leveling out the increases stop Andrew could probably give us the fields so where is capital for our sector well firstly we have a lot of capital that we don 't leverage in our own assets and I know this because at odyssey we had a 20 million dollar property 40 acres on the Aaron I couldn 't leveraging and I had a racv energy australia you know McKinsey graduates on my board it was a real heavy hitting business board people who 've worked with the Packers and when I said why don 't we leave reach his property that we have to create some money for us and invest I know you know we spent a long time building up these assets we don 't have risk them at the mental health counselor Australia I built up a reserve of over a million dollars which was where where I was immediately prior to this and I wanted to invest the part of that million dollars it wasn 't essential for our core operating and we had a former health minister on our board and other people and I said oh god I think we need to develop an investment strategy and I bought in investment advisors you know we ended up doing we put it in government bonds because you know I 've got to keep it safe dude we can 't afford to think like that and there 's other capital there 's superannuation funds there 's people looking for access money that 's in the sort of lost money kind of accounts and things like that we 've got to think differently about how we access Capital we need to measure don 't tell me how many beds you had occupied or how many clients you saw or how many people participated in your program so what when I go the states and talk to not-for-profit see they have this fantastic narrative about their agencies they 're able to talk about them in meaningful terms about what they achieve in a way that I find is often lacking in Australia we do not talk about our success very well we don 't measure it very well and we don 't talk about it very well we tend to express our our needs in terms of negative values rather than here 's the problem isn 't a terrible kind of talk rather than here 's the solution look at what we 've done look at what we can do I used to run these focus groups at odyssey why didn 't they were run by a Sweeney research who did I wanted to know what the profile of Odyssey house was I 've got to get private funding I need to know where we 're positioned they 'd run these focus groups I 'd sit in another room having a pizza and a beer and watch people in these focus groups and they 'd write them up and they break down the focus we do this every six months to a year and we look at our profile what people thought about our organization and we look about how the messaging around that might or might not be strong or weak we 'd actually do the work and I can tell you that drug treatment wasn 't particularly popular but finding people jobs and those achieving that kind of economic outcome surprisingly was very important to people at a community level more than we thought so the fact that we created new jobs for people and became an RTO and those kinds of things was much more important than the fact that we provided drug treatment and you start to think about why that is and the messaging and how dollars a year because we were careful about how we did it and we invested in it but measurement is critical at all levels and without measurement how can your reward success we 've got to stop kidding ourselves that we can all exist as little islands and we need to look at collaboration we need to look at the kinds of back office mergers we need to look at merging around our campaigns or around our fundraising around other things we 're just you know it 's just silly not to you know in in business if I see two companies company a and Company B and I can see if we can combine them we 'll make a bigger profit I can make a lot of money there are a lot of people making a lot of money doing exactly that going around and looking at where they can get this company in that company put them together and create a bigger profit margin and on that basis they can bring these companies together they can buy them both out or present merger options or and I 'll a lot of people get very rich in our sector if I see two organizations doing similar work in similar ways with back offices and everything that are unproductive commune and I want to put them together what incentive is there if I can show they provide better services to that commune who are our intermediaries intermedia is in the business world make a lot of money intermedia is now will barely exist as a handful and I 'm not sure that anyone is actually doing that work looking at where organizations are and how they could be more effective not in terms of financial benefit but in terms of better services to the people they 're meant to be serving remember the original purpose the original values what you are therefore we also need to look at how we develop ourselves our organizations our leadership our capacity some not-for-profit to manage by the last man standing and often is a man you know the personal estate around the longest knows the programs that might be all right but they need to be invested in so they can become people develop it and implement it not just how to run their programs we go to the next one almost finished so now i 'm just going to sum up with two quick overheads I 've always thought that what we do is incredibly valuable and that 's why I 've stayed in the sector all my life really and but I 've also felt that we have a responsibility to do more than just do good work because if we do good work it 's not enough I learned that very early and I 'll tell you one story of our time Rose me until when it 's 33 minutes okay I 'll tell it really quickly many years ago is working with kids have been expelled from schools in the western suburbs of Melbourne our teaching at a school called Williamstown tech next to the rifle range and I had all these 15 year old kids about 15 of them and you know real and the eyes kids who 've been kicked out of schools and I was running this program with this old crusty sheet metal to worker and we set up a farm and the kitchen and other things we 're making an active learning and we mentioned the kids there every day and because we 're the kids there every day the school got paid extra money so they paid salary so they were happy to have us and I read a book by a guy called art pearl American education professor I 'd read you know always kept reading mostly books about troubled young people about you know redefining the nature of the problem and you read these books and you know are they school truants are those school refuses are those school you know psychosis people are others who gives us stuff they don 't go to school you know what are you going to do about it and not many books actually focus on the what you do about it bit they focus on the redefining the problem but this book was all about what you do so I wrote him a little note saying thanks it 's the first book i 've read that 's actually about solutions for these kinds of less than a page the letter he wrote back saying I want to come and watch you teach and I was a bit sort of gum you know he 's an American professor I 'm coming to Australia I 'm going to come and watch you teach and you know there 's a long story here but the short story has became a really big deal here morning to you comes down to teach I 'm not stupid I 'd practice my lesson I knew what was going to happen it was going to be really good i start teaching this lesson this little bastard the kid bursts in he 'd just been in tirana in those days when kids had problems they 'd lock you up for three weeks to assess you because you 're unstable in your home environment so to assess you they had to lock you up and there we have any place to lock you up except youth training since so he 'd been locked up in a youth training center while they assist him after getting into trouble with the police on a stay given us stuff about what I wanted to talk about or you know my lesson and I could see just going but being the gifted teacher I through I thought I 'll make this kid the center so I had him I know whether you 've worked with kids like that they 're not very verbal you know if you ask them to do something they don 't want to do well I think it 's unfair they don 't say David that 's an inappropriate assignment of work tasks they don 't they just don 't say that they say other things that people might be offended by so but these kids are fantastic at reading environments better than me drug users are better in the of reading environments I get back and they read it so these kids are really good at con texting so I had him set up this whole children 's court because he just come from the children 's court that morning and he set it up and we had a case and I won 't go through all the details but he did all the players he directed the more appropriately I thought was a fantastic lesson because these kids and it might be useful for them had learned about the Children 's Court and how it operates in the roles of all the different people and he 'd done it really well you know I thought was a fantastic educational experience another example of my gifted teaching in a problem situations uphill big American guy stands up in front of them at the end of lesson and can I have them yeah yeah what you learn today nothing we just mucked around with David that 's why we come because when you go to school you don 't have to do any work could just get to muck around with David said thanks sat down I stood up into you little bastards if I 've given you a book on the Children 's Court and made you read chapter one and answer 20 questions and read chapter 2 and answer 20 questions and read credit would you have done work yes would you learn something yes but you didn 't today no says big guys guys arm around my shoulder he he said to me one of those kids doing now I said well they 're out in the playground creating bug or even so what are they saying said what what do you mean so what are they saying when people ask them what they 've been doing and I thought about it that they just muck around with David said okay so what are they saying two other kids said they just muck around with David well they 're saying when the teachers come over they just muck around with David well they 're saying when they get home they just muck around with David he said you are doing some of the most valuable work I 've seen and you are the most vulnerable program I have ever been to you know why no one belly is you even your clients don 't value you they just muck around with David and I 'm telling you that story because emotionally it was very difficult for me to learn that and I had to change what I did I had report and they had to build a support network in my school I created the curriculum initiatives group and I did a whole lot of things to address it I compared the outcomes of those kids to other kids expelled in the region and showed how effective we were and I 've never forgotten because it hurt it really hurt so I 'm saying to you doing good work is not enough you have to create values around what you do so my last slide is that the last load no it 's one more isn 't it thank you where things are going to change they 've always been changing our sector but they 're going to change more now because of the way the external environment is operating I want you never to forget what you 're there for that sense of values and purpose and even if things are going to go bad please make that the purpose because we as a sector will be stronger if we do and even if we go through ups and downs we want to do it on the basis that or trying to be something that we 're really not and I want you to tell your stories i want you two to have a voice it 's not just about whether you support or don 't support a government policy position it 's about what you achieve and why that 's important and how you want to achieve that more I want you to be an advocate for what you do because if you 're an advocate for what you do just as if I 've been an advocate for those kids those kids would have felt better about what they 're doing their families would have felt better about what they 're doing I would have felt better about what I was doing my school would have felt better about what I was doing my community would have felt better about what I was doing and because I wasn 't doing that those things were not happening I want you to become advocates and I also want you to support advocacy and most important importantly I want you to make sure that you both do good work and you 've talked to us about really important issues not just a values but of congruence between values and delivery and people 's experience of services but also in terms of the dynamic ways in in which even in a world where measures are imperfect of the kinds of things that can happen in the social sector we need to find intelligent and consistent ways of telling the story that are rigorous and that demonstrate the value that is created I was reminded listening to some of what you said over speech that sir Ronald Cohen with whom I 'm privileged to do some work may just recently at the mansion house in London sir Ronald has been leading work in social finance for the last 15 years following one of the most successful careers in venture capital and he was reflecting that as he has been leading work in the social finance task force in other forums that he 's come to realize why he thinks we face some predicaments for the social sector and he says the primary reason is that traditional philanthropy and sources of funding have achieving social outcomes it 's given charitable organizations money for two or three years and then told them as a sanity check they have to raise some more money elsewhere after that and also I reminded them that they shouldn 't be wasting any of it on overheads and yet he said if business entrepreneurs had come to him as a financier at Apex his company with business plans that involved investing nothing on overheads and the capacity of their business or on building strong executive teams he would have shown them the door that the combination of unpredictable funding and lack of investment capital has prevented many charitable organizations from realizing their potential for effectiveness in scale and I think David is reminding us this morning of that great potential and how beyond thinking about it in terms of business principles really we 're thinking about it in terms of discipline in terms of value creation and in terms of the fantastic insights and dynamism the community sector can bring with its connection to people in place now David 's happy to take some questions if there are people CEO Carolina programs fellow drug and alcohol treatment organization look many of us are looking to the future we 've been attending forums on Mutual 's and co-ops and learning about alternative business models and there was one in her last Monday here in the acct sponsored by an ECU and Minister Andrews opened that and at that opening he said we 're looking we 're going to be abolishing the acnc and we 're going to probably have a center of innovation can you tell me what you believe will happen in terms of red tape what if that occurs look we don 't know whether people saw it we wrote an open letter to the Prime Minister last week on the acnt I should declare an interest i 'm on the ACNC advisory board and certainly my members are very strong supporters the ACNC and i think the whole sector is it 's much better than the alternative being proposed which is actually the ATO we don 't want to be regulated by the ATO we 've had that and we end up in the high court trying ACNC has been doing I think fantastic work for our sector in a number of ways and because of that we have the support in the Senate not to have the acnc abolished and I expect we will have the support in the next Senate not to have it abolished so we 're continuing to talk to Minister Andrews and his chief of staff Ted lap caen it 's not a very fruitful discussion and have to see but we 're not prepared to say the ACNC is gone and I think we as a sector shouldn 't be prepared to say the acnc is gone I get tired of politicians standing up and saying they want to listen to the sector and then when the sector speaks saying we disagree we 've got a policy decision we 're going to do what we want to do anyway so for us it 's a very live issue supporting the acnc they 're starting to be some concern in the coalition about the level of backlash around the acnc and we 'll leverage that when the acnc legislation gets the senate an inquiry and we 'll have a chance to again talk about its benefits for our sector we all want a one-stop shop and what the minister was talking about in terms of having the acct align its its fundraising and registration and that with the acnc makes perfect sense and was a good measure and as South Australia had agreed to do I don 't know why anyone would want to under what I do know there are two core vested interests one is the Archdiocese of Sydney you don 't want any transparency and the other is the Financial Services Council of Australia who are responsible for all the trustee companies that manage charitable trusts and they don 't want any transparency because charitable the trustee companies are managing money of people who died and often they 're the sole trustees and they 're in a position where some of those trustees charge significant fees in perpetuity so that continues on forever they have this pool of money they can invest they pay themselves investment fees have this pool of money they account for that pay themselves accounting themselves a trustee fee and sometimes I pay themselves other fees for dispersing the money when they disperse it and sometimes they don 't disperse much and you know this became an issue for us as an organization because some of our members who were the sole beneficiary of certain trustees so the trustee had to give all their money to this particular charity found that their income was reduced by over 100,000 in one year when one trustee come inside to put its fees up and we find it remarkable they 're allowed to get away with that kind of behavior so I noticed John Brogden the Financial Services Council came out in response to our media last week saying he posed it and of course the only other two tickler came out with both from the Catholic Church I don 't think the representative of the whole sector would be my view we 've got a couple of other questions down in this part of the room these are going to the far side first and then we 'll come back to this gentleman hi David Susan Hillier sit hi i just had a couple of reflections on the material that you presented i 'd be interested to hear your thoughts on those one was around we 've had ten ten years or more of an expectation around not-for-profits starting to operate more through a market model and to engage more in market driven behaviors and I think that 's you 've talked about how that then challenges the values of organizations I think there 's it also sets up these kind of competing imperatives and I think one of the parts of the conversation that I think needs more visibility is this year round market failure so there 's some real problems with the way markets operate particularly for the people for whom a lot of our organizations have been established and for whom they operate and so the assumption that that adopting more market-based approaches to things will improve our efficiency and our coherence and our strategic sustainability i think is open to question i think the other issue is around we 've had lots of people who have an enormous amount of market experience you about a venture capitalist he 's worked 15 years we haven 't seen a lot of benefit come out of that in terms of really shifting the public 's perception around what not-for-profits ought to be able to do and how they ought to be able to operate there 's a lot of discomfort with not-for-profits operating in ways you know talking about their capital talking about investment talking about actually so that that creates this tension I think in terms of organizations developing and moving on the other reflection I would give is that I think in the acct we 've actually worked really hard on setting ourselves up and the not-for-profit sector has led setting ourselves up for the future so we 've got the community sector leaders forum that is a self-funded learning and development forum for senior executives in our sector and has focused really certainly in the last 12 months on looking at things like how do you cap raising capital different ways of innovating and setting up business models at cost runs the social impact measurement networking we have quite a lot of work of leadership in this sector around measurement and and what we what we struggle with is a lack of government and funder willingness to engage with this on those on those areas of development so I 'm just interested to hear your views on those two issues those three issues and the the the first one is no one favors a Darwinian approach to the not-for-profit sector you know survival of the fittest I don 't think the minister saying that I don 't think I don 't hear governments around Australia or even investors in the sector saying that you know I I spent a lot of my time was head of the alcohol and other drugs Council of Australia for seven years you know it 's not a popular sector people for some reason don 't seem overly willing to provide funding to guys in tattoos and thongs who 've been in prison compared to babies in humid cribs you know there 's there 's it 's not a level playing field in the sense of compassion out there and you know there are a whole range of means but what I see is that the sector itself has also not been good at marketing what it achieves and I think the measurement ties into that very well we need to do measure better and you know a lot of the reason we haven 't done measurement is because it was never useful to do measurement no one ever you didn 't make any difference government gave money to people with our effective or ineffective if you rent n beds and everyone got ya better or employed all that got back with their families that was grave un 10 beds and none of that happened and all those people came back in two years bad luck you got the same money like there was no distinction i remember when i first got taught us in i started a levers program because it couldn 't believe the way people left it was so bad i thought we 'd had these people living there for a period of time and we hadn 't developed proper re-integration programs so we developed this leavers program that worked really well and it meant ring me up and said we 're going to cut your funding I said but we 've been more we have more beds full we 've been busier than ever people they said no you haven 't had enough separations none of people have left and in those days they would pay me ten thousand dollars for a residential episode of care ten thousand dollars per person whether they stayed for weeks or four years I mean no one stayed for years we have one woman who had a baby twins there who stayed 18 months the average length of day was today was 131 days so they 've calculated that out said you get ten grand for every person that 's it so guess what some agencies did they 'd only have people for a certain period of time and then they get rid of them because I got the 10 grand that way the way the system works promotes behavior in our sector that is not in our interests often and so I think we have had to compete in ways that are counterproductive and we have had the ways that government and others provide money but I can tell you that if you lift your sights beyond immediate funding to achieving a better outcome for your community you will be in a stronger position with government in the future because ultimately governments have to respond to communities and if you can show your successful with people and that you rebuild communities and rebuild lives and achieve outcomes regardless of who you 're working with you will get support and that 's been my experience I think it 's great that you 've got a leaders for him I think the more we can bring people in the not-for-profit sector together the better far too often we haven 't_''_3108.34 been brought together and we stayed in our silos we need to get together more often we need to develop our skills share ideas have arguments and I do think this this notion of competing needs to be not about competing for the money but competing to achieve better outcomes and using that as a rationale for decision-making by you as an organization and then presenting that to government the last question of the gentleman who is waiting and then we are favorable native thinks I 've been partially because I 'm by they 've asked Christopher in the responsible the message I believe you 're putting across is that there 's a great risk of the process of the product in it sorry I 'm pathetic the process can become the end in itself I have a revulsion to the use of word marketing in lots of literature relating to this marketing surely is oriented towards not towards the consumer Pfizer doesn 't really care about the people who have taken the drug in Bangkok it 's about the producer I think that 's the wrong word it leads us already we mentioned the competition and in fact can become a major activity of unity is just competing there can we not get some other way which is focused on the what should the difference you 're making not on the product of producing and I mean that they 've attitude of saying this is a product to produce you 've got to use it we want to David Jones or meijer I believe that marketing is at the appropriate word to be used in any context but here you can have a valuation of the worth what someone 's doing without having to look at it from marketing point of view look the consumers point of view not the market thanks you have a guy agreed to a point you don 't have to call it marketing you can call it whatever you want but you want to be valued and if you believe I mean the whole point of me telling that story if I believe those kids are important if I believe that program i 'm doing with those kids is important then i have to do more than just through the program i have to create value around that i have to have it valued by my peers I have to have a value by my clients I have to have a valued by their parents and others and if you 're not going to do that you will not survive if you 're not valued then you 're vulnerable you need to be create value around what you 're doing you don 't like the term marketing call it you know evaluation or creating value or whatever you want but you know at some point if people don 't know the positive stories about who you are what you do and they don 't share those then you are vulnerable we will need to hold it there and I 'm sure you 'll be able to catch catch David in one of the brakes later today will you join me please in thanking _"

    "text": "thank you very much good morning ladies and gentlemen distinguished guests it 's wonderful to be here this morning can I begin to by acknowledging we 're gathered on the lands of the novel people and to pay my respects to elder 's past and present this morning I 'm very pleased to be able to launch the ACS community sector development program the program has five integrated modules sustainability and strategic risk governance and financial management collaboration and strategic alliances working with government and tendering and procurement and we 've heard this period of tremendous change this development program is not the only ACA government initiative that 's going to impact on the community sector in the territory many have already participated in design work for the Human Services blueprint the government has also commenced a series of major reforms to a community sector procurement to contracting and to reporting today 's seminar on sector sustainability and strategic risk is the first of a series of events on this topic over the next 18 months so from the acct government 's point of view a sustainable sector is one delivering positive social impacts sustainability is organizationally neutral though in simple terms our community needs just enough capable organizations not too many not too few and they won 't be the same organizations over this extended journey at the level of individual community sector organisations sustainability means that over the next 10 20 years and beyond a specific organization has to have the ongoing capacity to play its part in delivering a positive social impact sustainable organizations within the sector will have a skills-based board good governance an appropriate business model financial strength a strong and skilled management team and skilled and well workers and the government is more interested in these high-level characteristics and in delivering outcomes than we are on the black letter of reporting this has got to be a step forward in the relationship between government and the community sector one that 's based on trust and on collaboration and I look forward to it continuing we know that there are considerable challenges ahead in the sector for the government and for our community as a whole the Australian Federation particularly in the context of our you may have heard Ken Henry the former Secretary of the Commonwealth Treasury recently talking about the unsustainability of the tax basis of state states and territories dr. Henry spoke of the great difficulties the government 's face in funding new large social programs from budget cuts alone and there 's treasure of the acct I can tell you I 'm in a pretty good position to know that his comments apply just as much here in Canberra as they do to any other part of the country and that 's why the acct government has embarked upon tax reform a hard but necessary task to ensure our city 's long-term economic sustainability and there will come a time in the not-too-distant future when the territory simply runs out of land and other assets to sell to finance our city 's needs that we 've not reformed our tax system by this time then the city will be in serious financial trouble and what this means specifically for the community sector is that in the short and medium term sustainability is not going to be achieved off the back of a more sustainable revenue base will allow for more important and strategic investments in the territories community services but during the transition period it will be very challenging we all know that demand for services will rise thanks to the inevitability of demographics and the ups and downs of the economic cycle the big risk is that we will collectively fail to achieve the social impact that we 're striving for to build a strong and fair community and a strong and fair economy there 's also a big risk that individual organizations will succumb to the many pressures that they face we don 't want this to happen and whilst a rational perspective might be that so long as there are some in the sector able to pick up the slack it doesn 't really matter if the make up of the sector changes over time where they necessarily want to bring that hard-headed rational approach to sector reform none of us want to see organizations failing none of us want to see people 's jobs threatened none of us wanna see clients forced to find alternative support but in the coming period there are some fundamental strategic risks to sustainability that every single organization is going to have to address including those in the community sector many of these risks do sit with the sector to address but not all of them the government will seek to find ways in which we can reduce or mitigate this impact there are also some policy risks from the ICT government 's perspective we 're fairly well aligned we think with the community sectors policy priorities would work closely over many years to develop a strong shared framework most recently the collaboration on the human services blueprint has demonstrated the strengths of this relationship another example the NDIS a significant policy reform strongly supported by the community especially people with disabilities and their families the policy shift though from block funding to a market-based model is very very significant and could well be the first area the first area of social reform to undergo such a shift the tough part of this significant reform the implementation phase is starting to happen now there are certainly risks associated with the rollout of risks to manage not risks to avoid but as you would all know no major social reform is easy no major social reform is risk free at a national policy level we still get a better sense of how the new Australian Government settles and how much difference there 's going to end up burning between how and what they wish to deliver for our community and how we wish to deliver community services in Canberra equally the anticipated abolition of the acnc is creating uncertainty we had planned to shift our regulation of charities in the territory to the ACNC to reduce duplication and to make improvements to report it sadly I fear that opportunity is now lost there are also financial risks at this point in time largely post by the Commonwealth Government here in Canberra we face to risks the broad risk to our economy and to our community from potential job cuts and a significant withdrawal of the commonwealth government from our economy the specific risk also of budget funding for specific programs or national partnerships assessing or significantly diminishing now this is a challenge that face the second risk but only we face both and this risk may also be magnified right now because of the uncertainty while we always have a firm I to the Commonwealth budget this year ladies and gentlemen I think the anticipation and the trepidation is higher than it has been for many years but the financial risks are more fundamental than just the Commonwealth budget as Ken Henry and many others have know that government budgets across the world are under pressure Australia actually has stood out in recent years and in the acct we 've stood out within Australia as having fundamentally strong economies but the challenges remain traditionally governments have supported community sector entities in doing the good things they do in the community sometimes just because they were doing good things in the community but in these times of competing priorities for scarce resources government owes it to taxpayers to fund for outcomes and this is a national and an international trend what we 're doing here in the territory is to shift our service funding agreements from a focus on delivering outputs to one that come to one of my favorite categories of risk regulation now let me tell you the ability of Parliament 's and bureaucracies to generate useless time-wasting regulation can be staggering I probably don 't need to convince anyone in the room of that I think we are in competition at times not always but in times with some of the worst bureaucratic outcomes in the nation not necessarily in the world but certainly in the nation we 've had our share of challenges and problems and we need to work through those but this government is seriously interested in reducing those burdens not least for our own internal purposes but also for yours I recognize this is one of the most significant risks to your operations and I 'm actively looking at ways to reduce this I see the government 's role as being a catalyst and a resource aggregator something that can bring together different forms of assistance to community sector organizations virtually all of the modules of the sector development program operate on this principle where we 've aggregated the co contribution that many of you make and contribution for your strategic benefit and I hope today 's session is the beginning of this so to summarize the strategic risks to your sustainability are very real I 'm certain that in five years time this sector will look very different many of the risks we 've talked about particularly those arising from economic pressures from demographic societal technological and similar changes cannot be avoided and have to be engaged with head-on you will only be able to manage those risks if your organization has a clear mission is financially strong operationally nimble efficient has capable workers and is well read by implementing the human services blueprint by focusing on outcomes by removing unnecessary regulation and administrative clutter and by providing targeted support through the sector development program we 're determined to play our role to help this sector continue to grow in strength and in capability we look forward to partnering with you in the future before I close this morning I 'd like to take the opportunity to acknowledge the valuable assistance of the community sector reform advisory group many of you are in the room today into what would be the most valuable reforms for the sector input also has come from consultants sector leaders and people outside the sector so it 's no surprise as a result we now have a flexible and an innovative development program that i 'm confident can be of great value to the sector to help now and into the future thank you very much Thank You Minister bar and the minister has kindly agreed to take questions for about 10 minutes if there are people from the floor who would like to take this opportunity to ask some questions and we have some roving mics as well have a question back here Minister Simon Rosenberg from North Side community service that I guess the major theme today is community sector reform if I can ask I suppose a somewhat cheeky question that is what about government sector reform I think most of us in the room would be very much in favor of an increasing partnership arrangement and while will never be equals because you have the funding you 're the policy agency we will hopefully contribute increasingly to I think are being recognized in government that need to be handled as well as in the sector so can you tell us a bit about your thinking there so what I mean the the press club is the place for checking questions isn 't that say excellent star look guess I the the need for further reform in the way the ICT government conducts its see the entirety of its operation so lot of what I 've said in my speech this morning applies equally to how the government goes about delivering services either directly to the community or directly through stakeholders we have a digital-first policy now for the territory government we will be needing to transition the bulk of our of our operations into that online space that in theory with an upfront investment delivers considerable savings for the government in the way that we engage with stakeholders and that that can be is a straightforward and a very simple example is that it for every face-to-face transaction with the acct government it costs us about ten dollars every online transaction is about ten cents the difference two more useful purpose that you can 't go obviously from removal of all three candidates have instantly remove all face to face service provision and not all areas of government lend themselves to that reform but some areas do and in some areas we lag well behind either other governments or other organizations that deliver similar sorts of services turn to the organizational structure of the government since since the hawk review and the one government model there have been some improvements in cultural operations if you like within within the government and some reduction in the siloing approach and unfortunately the ministerial system and the budget system tend to reinforce so the into the next iteration of ICT government reform that the Chief Minister will announce in due course not being my place this morning to make that announcement will see further development of that of that one government approach looking to ensure that in terms of the outward focus of ICT government the people don 't have to shop around many different forms don 't have to have the conversations with health justice education community services to that we know we face I 've been driving that change through the budget process there 's nothing like the flow of money to generate cultural change within an organisation and part of that has been to provide a pool of funding for new initiatives within the territory budget that require cross agency collaboration that require agencies to work together to deliver better outcomes and you can see that in the corrective services area working more closely with community services and with education in terms of for example how we how we approach the support systems for those who exit from our corrective services system that 's one example there there are many more that we 're seeking to pursue nothing happens quickly in government but it should happen more quickly in the ICT and elsewhere give the smaller size of our bureaucracy and I think with the right incentives in place by way of a clear directive from the cabinet that we want that sort of agency collaboration and we want some of those silos removed that will help there 's still a fundamental challenge though in that they streams and they will still be directorates so they 'll church your quote about democracy being the worst form of government except for all the rest that Westminster and the arrangements we have here and I 'll ideal but there hasn 't only it is yet being a better model but we 're working on improving the one that we have in the territory so we have time for a couple more questions one with the back i under christina ryan advocacy for inclusion you mentioned being more virtual and doing a whole bunch more stuff online I guess some I 'm aware that the Oct has got a very high rate of internet usage but for people with disabilities and particularly for people who are highly isolated it 's less than fifty percent so I 'm really concerned about the access of our consumers our members to that world if we if we shift it without the government coming forward and a good example about the treasury consultation documents for the budget process last you were only available in PDF completely useless to a huge number of people so of how to make sure that everyone comes forward and particularly with the NDIS when people will become more engaged potentially more employed in the community sector we would hope is going to be acting as a major employer for a lot of people so I guess I 'd like to be aware that you 've got some recognition of that that you 're actually remembering it on an ongoing basis and in fact have plans in place for how government will ensure that accessibility is across the board and not an afterthought that we constantly have to remind you about which is kind of where we 're sitting now sure look though we 've we 've not done digital particularly well no we haven 't and it has to get better but it is inevitable so there 's certainly no point trying to hold back that tied everything that can possibly digitized will and in some areas of the economy it 's happening at a rate that is going to be on what you would think is fathomable but it is happening but it is going to is going possibly can where anyone can possibly make a dollar out of it that is a given the challenge for for government is that we are even in the ACA a slow beast when it comes to turning turn into this area but I recognized that the change is inevitable the challenge of implementation is that is the big one and yes we will probably need constant reminding of those points because it is easy to get lost in the you know if you like the statistics of ninety-two percent home internet connection in the acct the National Broadband Network the highest take up in the nation is here in the acct in the areas where it 's provided so we have a significant element of the community who are way ahead of government you know they 're five years ahead of us then there 's a significant part of the community that 's five years behind and how you bring that part of the community forward one thing that is good in this area I guess is that the economics of it are driving costs down and down and down able to get for a certain certain unit cost is now massively enhanced and as this technology just rolls over the world it will get cheaper and cheaper and cheaper that 's the good news in terms of its universal availability the challenge for the government it 's going to be what we do in the intervening period which could be another five years or so before this technology is just so ubiquitous that we 're not having this conversation about about who 's left behind some of the things the very practical things we can do to provide free Wi-Fi throughout the city that will will give people access to the internet for free and the capability to access the services that can be delivered in that in that context that won 't be the complete answer but it 's part of it in the short term but over time as the the pace of change of technology continues I suspect our challenges are going to be keeping up with people rather than needing to to ensure that there aren 't people left behind but where there 's a there was one more question in the in the middle here and then one down the back in there Thank You Stephen Fox National Disability Services my question also relates to the NDIS Minister you talked about it in a sense perhaps being a forerunner in terms of moving towards a more market-driven environment and I think that offers two challenges which had to seek your views about firstly how the sector itself retains its community character its engagement in the broader arrangements for supporting people in need and who are vulnerable and secondly I think that market driven our side of things faces challenges for government and I 'd be interested to know if the government has any further views about its role either as a service provider or indeed looking forward to the full rollout of the NDIS what the accts continued mission will be in the space concerned with disability okay well I 'll go to the second question first so that 's the subject of some consideration within government in the very near future possibly even tomorrow so i won 't_''_1466.9 i won 't be pre-empting faster say David it is it is a significant issue that that we are considering and over what time frame and in terms of a transition if if indeed we are to make a significant transition from the way we 've currently been been doing business I to the first question well I think they will there will inevitably be as a result of this change people coming in to deliver services with a profit motive I think that 's an inevitable outcome of the ndas model and as to whether a time will tell us whether the indigo NDIS model is successful everyone loved it in theory practical implications are are going to be the challenge different government implementing it to that that proposed it different state governments with different approaches so it 's so to say even you know inside of six months it 's a very different beast to what it was when Prime Minister Gillard passed the legislation and provided the funding in her last in her last budget so I suspect that that will continue to be an evolution there from the community sectors perspective I have no doubt that that across the sector locally and and nationally that that will occur I think it 's going to be universal way I think I could put my hand on my heart now inside at every community sector organization is going to get this right and be outstandingly successful in this new world I don 't think that 's true then the majority will but I think there will also be some new entrants who might deliver some innovation and deliver services in a different way that we might not have thought about yet and technology again will play a significant role in that but it it does remain to be seen we need to closely monitor if this service delivery model doesn 't work then I wouldn 't foresee it being rolled out in other areas of the community sector in the long run might need some refinement along the way they 'll be interesting questions particularly in smaller jurisdictions in regional areas whether there will be a sufficient base for for the market to be able to provide services efficiently and effectively there could as well the design of this will be important and consumer expectations are going to be a challenge too I think there 's there 's no death and rightly so expectations are very high so there is there is also a risk we won 't broadly as I sector meet those expectations that risk is very realtor I think we had one more question down down the back here and then the minister will need to leave us some press questions good morning Tim Babington from sexual health and family planning acct thank you for your overview administer a question in the spirit of the ones that have come around you 're thinking we hear a lot about a changed world for community service organizations over the next five to ten year like a period of time could you give us some of your thinking on who should be picking winners and losers in that kind of environment and what sort of criteria should inform that so okay so very it 's a very good question it applies in so many areas of public policy like a best time it depending on your on your outlook either way either way consumers are going to drive are going to drive a lot a lot of change in many areas there are probably some sectors some elements of the community sector where the consumer or the client is not particularly empowered and we 're really it 's would take what 's available or there 's nothing else available and that will probably slow change in some in some parts of the sector it 's probably not going to be all that well there is i should say there is a power imbalance in some areas some people 's voices are stronger than others some people have better advocates who can champion their calls for reform of service delivery or more resources going into a particular area and that applies within the sector and across the broader problem realm of public policy take a long run view of these things unless we reform our revenue basis then everyone no matter where you sit in society which sector you know which set of interests your lobbying or representing if there are fewer winners get going to is going to end up being in a better position in five or ten years tight I am deadly serious when I say the Federation in terms of its financial relations is approaching breaking point we simply cannot fund the soirée labor if you like a labor social agenda of a liberal tax base you can 't abolish carbon taxes mining taxes cut company tax cut personal tax and think that you can continue to run the sorts of social programs that this country does just cannot be done you can 't fund that off budget cuts in other areas not unless you are going to savage health and education which consume you know more than half of state and territory budgets and are growing at a rapid rate and you know the observation i made about demographics is currently as society ages we are consuming more and more of our available resources into the health field now it 's everyone 's number one priority everyone wants more money spent on health every opinion poll everywhere in the nation in every jurisdiction what 's our communities number one then that those two areas consume the bulk of our resources but it can 't continue as it is forever something has to give yeah and it 's it 's a bit of an indictment on the Australian political system that the smallest jurisdiction in the country is the only one engaging in any meaningful tax reform to try and do something to ensure that we have the resources to deliver the services when our community all need but you were most of you would have been in Canberra in 2012 and would have seen the campaign that was run how are you rates are they all tripled in the in the last 12 months but seriously there 's no magic pudding if we want to deliver the services that I think people in this room agree the community needs it 's got to be paid for and it can 't_''_1927.81 be paid for just out of cuts in other areas of government expenditure I hope that answers the questions you so Minister thank you for what 's being a very candid assessment of a number of the risks and and the structural things that are driving that locally as well as brought up I think global trends in that are challenging our binary notions of public and private but also I think in what I heard daring us to imagine a community sector that can be both focused on accountability for results engaging with those risks but perhaps going less where the money is and more driven by outcomes and able to set their strategies to do what they do best to deliver on that will you join me in thanking the minister _"

    "text": "thank you very much Michael for your introduction and for sponsoring the lunch and for the 3 million dollars very gratefully received it doesn 't sound like enough really but get it Andrew to chase that up after lunch I 'd like to begin by acknowledging the traditional custodians of the land on which we meet this afternoon then of all people and I extend my respects to their elders past and present and also acknowledge the ongoing contribution they make to the life of our city and our region professor Michael freighter and rhubarb Deputy Chief Minister Brendan Smith Michelle Melbourne Chris folks business council members distinguished guests thank you very much for the opportunity to address you today and share with you the acct government 's outlook on the territory it 's such an important time for our city and our economy I 'll take some time to reflect on the current state of play as we move towards a crucial few months before I speak in detail about key priorities for the acct government i 'll also be announced in today two important initiatives as part of improve livability in our city and diversification across the economy as you would expect my team and I have planned for various scenarios from the much anticipated federal budget and prepared ourselves to act where intervention is warranted but the point i 'd like to make clear today is that we won 't be hitting the panic button the acct government 's long-term commitments to economic reform and fairness across the community will continue there are some very exciting initiatives taking shape which reflect this fact and demonstrate that we are already seeing the emergence of a stronger more diverse economy as I speak about these and the government 's commitment to stay the course on our own commitments I hope you here at the very least and echo of your own ambitions for the future of our city today marks exactly two months to the hand down in the next federal budget and possibly less time to the release of the government 's commission of audit obviously the acct government awaits both documents with interest and I expect that each of you are doing the same it would be and the associated speculation that comes with that but instead I think we should deal with the facts that we know and then focus on the vision and the opportunities that will present themselves over the next few years so to some facts if six months since the federal election and the start of a series of cuts to Commonwealth agencies it 's two years since the federal spending contraction began in earnest and it 's six years since the global financial crisis first sent tremors through our economy throughout this period the fundamentals of the acct economy have remained strong forecast economic growth for 2013-14 is unchanged from last June at one point seven five percent retail trade figures are positive with growth of three point four percent in the year two january2014 population growth remains steady and employment growth in our economy is slow but steady the combined efforts of public and private sectors have driven growth in investment exports and jobs and shown an economic resilience which not everyone thought we had the fact that unemployment remains at three point eight percent the lowest in the country retail activity in shape just as importantly is maintaining levels of confidence and cohesiveness in our community stimulus and job creation protecting the livelihoods of working canberrans remains a core priority of our government through 2014 the question becomes what is the best way for the territory government to support local jobs pumping vast amount of money direct into the economy is neither within our means or our economic philosophy we worked hard to earn our economic credentials a strong budget position and a triple-a credit rating and we use these advantages strategically we 've created capacity for government to invest productive infrastructure which attracts private sector buying and delivers a long-term dividend to our economy the 480 million dollar canberra airport project is a great example it drew a high level of private investment it 's helped create an attractive commercial precinct it delivers major capability boost for tourism across the Capital Region the infrastructure is ready for direct international flights and it directly connects to the madura Parkway which itself is estimated to deliver a 1 billion dollar dividend in the long term we 've also been able the stimulus package announced last week this package was a direct response to the advocacy of our local industry groups for changes in particular around less variation and extension of time charges the package also offers a boost for housing affordability through the accelerated development in Moncrief and we want to see industry continuing to innovate in the construction of quality affordable housing the government 's land release program now includes a pipeline of more than 500 million dollars in landscape and civil works across the green field and infill estates in the acct now as the government painstakingly frames the 2014-15 budget bit by bit line by line we 're maintaining the strict discipline and budget strategy these times demand the snapshot I provided before sums up why we 're better prepared for the coming challenges as a government as a business community and across the economy and certainly better than we 've been in the past but it 's vital that government maintains a level perspective the acct budget has nine percent of our economy can respond to federal belt-tightening but not to savage austerity our exposure is times the size of our own and we cannot absorb large redundancies our GST revenue continues to decline relative to the service it 's supposed to pay for and further cuts to that will hurt direct funding for vital reforms and community services if cut would undermine hard-won gains for our schools and for some of our most vulnerable citizens for our part we are resolute in delivering on promises that we 've made to our community including our commitments under national reforms our frontline health workforce and health infrastructure will grow our disability sector will be supported to transition to ND is our school resourcing will increase with all schools across Canberra resource to the Gonski resourcing standard and we will continue the delivery of our ambitious plan to stop rising obesity rates I led a delegation of key business representatives to meet with the assistant infrastructure and Regional Development Minister Jamie Briggs last month Minister Briggs is aware that our employment and growth are our top priorities and it 's important that government and business remain united on this front our early discussions have been very productive and plans for the widely supported convention facilities we will continue regular meetings with Minister Briggs and have agreed to meet again once the federal budget is handed down in May while I put great value on a good working relationship with the federal government I think in this room it 's important to acknowledge that there 's a limit to what support we can expect to receive that 's why we aren 't waiting around for bad news to come to us we acted early on economic stimulus and we 're pressing ahead with perhaps the most ambitious tax reform agenda in Australia too often this reform program is dumbed down in a tabloid discussion about rates but I believe there is broad support across our business community we are already heading towards a nine percent improvement in the efficiency of our tax base by 2016-17 in other words this means a yield of 57 million dollars for our economy which is no longer absorbed by administration and compliance sales activity in the commercial sector has increased following the decision to drop commercial convey studi 25.5 the properties valued at the country and our support for small business through the reduction of payroll tax is also delivering important support both to individual businesses and to the group government 's drive for diversification Australia 's experience is shown that early movers on economic reform reap the rewards and whilst we may be the smallest government in Australia we don 't like ideas nor courage nor the willingness to cast aside misperceptions of others and lead the way on big changes which will have long-term payoffs for our community it is our fundamental belief in the potential of the acct and broader regional economies which drives our ambitious agenda but a great economy demands a great feeling heart which is why I 'm pleased today to release the final version of the city plan which has been released publicly in its draft form before which really shows a step forward in the transformation of Canberra 's city centre and you 'll find that on your table the views of 15,000 canberrans have been combined with the work of expert planners to set the direction for what will be a transformation in civic public transport focused in the city they want less through traffic more appeal and a stronger identity flattering as it is to hear things like fradin is looking more like Melbourne all the time or even my Sydney friends would like this place we 're not here to seek comparisons Canberrans want a city center which says Canberra and they overwhelmingly and the overwhelming sentiment is they want it sooner rather than later the city plan creates a blueprint for this transformation to happen a framework for extensive residential growth and civic plans to regress major infrastructure projects and a permanent bridging of the divide between the city and the lake the government will be announcing in the near future the fast tracking of some of the next stages of the city to Lake project and i look forward to selling the project in china next as part of the Prime Minister and Minister for trades delegation and the deputy chief minister will be doing the same in Singapore and in Hong Kong in June the city plan is there to guide decision making for the public and private sectors a process already well underway it will steer the city center towards the commercial and cultural hub which both our city and regional communities have said it ought to be under the plan which was funded by the Commonwealth Government the acct is investing progress to progress key projects such as the parks way split boulevard conference center and the redevelopment of the ABC flats perhaps the defining feature of the city plan is the introduction of light rail as a spine of our future public transport network and catalyst for an economic resurgence along Northbourne Avenue let 's be clear transport pressures in the Civic to Gungahlin corridor are not a future prediction they 're here now with five times the territory 's average population growth combined with car dependency at around ninety percent this corridor is a major pressure point on the transport system and the economy with projected costs running into the hundreds of millions of dollars Capital Metro is not only a transport building a transport solution it 's a city building project a major capital investment which delivers against other key priorities online laying out development with a major uplift effect across the along the corridor a centerpiece of the transformation of a city centre a high quality connection with the new dicks and development announced last week by the treasurer a driver of commercial growth in the gun Garland town centre a more active healthy and affordable transport option for cam bearings a template for the transport system of the future and a project which will pick up some of the spare capacity created by the completion of other major infrastructure projects and visit these are the reasons why we choose to invest now the long-term firmly in our minds the government 's capital metro agency will be far more visible in the city this year as it ramps up its work program of planning and consultation the city plan also reflects broader elements of the government 's productivity and public health agenda in our support for active living and if I could just paint this picture and I was hoping you 're all going to have sugary dessert but unfortunately so a healthy option so I can 't use the joke that I tuck into dessert but I 'm pleased it is healthy if we again look at some of the facts in camera we have one of the most overweight metropolitan populations in Australia which is in turn one of the most overweight countries in the world despite the highly educated nature of our community and the abundant access to quality food we cam bearings are well on track for as many of us as eighty percent of us to be overweight or obese by 2025 now there 's a target we don 't want to achieve if these trends go unchecked or unchallenged our public health costs will threaten the sustainability of every other part of the budget and completely undermine the games we 're working so hard to achieve elsewhere I do want to make it clear that our goal which is simply to stop the growing levels of obesity at the current rate sixty-three percent of adults being overweight or obese it 's not about 19 people or restricting their fun or individual freedoms it 's a call to action similar to the campaign 's run over previous decades government business and community sectors to be part of the solution on obesity it goes to the very heart of livability and productivity in our city these are assets we 're very proud to lead the way on as attested by the recent my city survey and we need to keep working to improve them interestingly some developers are already at the forefront of designing facilities which encourage active trance outdoor recreation and connections to public infrastructure which do the same a city center which has reached its potential particularly as the economic heart of the region is also going to support further diversification we believe in the ability of this economy to compete and succeed not only in construction and property development but in other high-skilled high wage industries of the future many of you are familiar with the government 's diversification agenda which is led by the Deputy Chief Minister which is heavily focused on growing the economy through human capital as with our micro economic reform this program is yielding results sustained growth in higher education exports our IT industry maturing and attracting global attention regional tourism invest in sectors where our economy has distinct advantages these success stories are all contributing to the headline economic indicators I 've mentioned and we want to see them do more our tertiary institutions are at the heart of our growth as a knowledge-based economy cameras placed in the global education market and it 's recognition as a study destination of firming up and we are very deliberately building on the research base which drives innovation attracts talent supports business formation and generates growth more than 10,000 international students are spending more than 440 million dollars in our economy each year and the education sector now generates eleven percent of our tourist activity our direct links in Asia are strengthening and this is an agenda I will be pushing strongly during my trip to China with the Prime Minister next month let 's remember that world-class education sector is also home our cameras also home to world-class research organizations such as the CSIRO nichter geoscience australia and the John Curtin school of medical research looked at it in its whole this sector includes 45,000 people in this region and contributes education industry so significant to its makeup which is why the AC team must continue to assert itself as straight as Australia 's learning capital on top of direct investments in our institutions we are working at a strategic level to identify the future opportunities in this sector and promote it to the world most notably through our study Canberra program one of the true signs of innovation is in the commercialization of some of the talent and ideas which are so present in Canberra today the camera business council is an active partner in helping us to nurture technological innovation and this work is added to by invest Canberra and the new private sector investment framework together let 's dispel the idea that a government town can 't compete globally at the cutting edge of innovation and digital technology the government 's determination to do this is the reason we 've developed a strategy to create a truly digital city this strategy is set out in the digital camera action plan which I 'm also releasing today backed by a 4.4 million dollar investment the plan shows our vision city it provides the road map of how we 're going to accelerate business engagement with the digital economy and help business access new customers and markets and it puts new impetus behind the government 's commitment to lead by example using technology to be a more open government making it easier for people to access our services innovating in how we engage with the community and cutting red tape for local business in other words we are a government moving towards digital by default and we are enabling the most tech-savvy community in Australia to do the same today I 'm pleased to announce that five priority projects to kick off the action plan the role the first one is the rollout of free Wi-Fi in Canberra will start to come online in civic from the second half of this year free Wi-Fi will then roll out in other town centres and commercial precincts to deliver the benefits of greater connectivity across the acct once complete the territories network will be the largest free outdoor public network in Australia well not a service for business directly it will create the fast-growing digital media channels the second project will relates to garima place and we will see graham a place become the center of digital innovation in canberra through the creation of a dedicated digital space and digital screen the space will create a new forum from the meeting of creative minds and creative digital ideas in the city it will be a very visible reminder of cameras excellence in the digital world and another illustration of contemporary urban development in the heart of the city connected to the grammar place digital space we 're looking to create a digital and innovation hub as a service center for digital government and the digital economy this hub would help concentrate the development and incubation of digital ideas building both the culture and the capability of the sector through practical support to connect innovators with applications in government and industry the third area is digital business capacity building workshops delivered in partnership with Canberra Business Council and individual vendors which will respond to research the government carried out last year around the digital capabilities and needs of our business community we will to make the most of the digital economy and achieve the growth it can help deliver in further support for businesses which choose to upskill grants totaling 225 thousand dollars for science technology engineering and mathematics internships will offer the private sector acct government support in training of their staff finally the innovation pitch panel which I know members of the Business Council have put to me as an idea of the years will create a forum for local innovations aimed directly at the acct government we know that some of the best ideas come from outside government and we want to make sure there are no to us being early adopters of local digital innovations which may save money or improve services to our community as with higher education a globally competitive digital economy in Canberra is no longer just an aspiration even for businesses one or two levels removed from the IT sector the evidence clearly shows that those with a strong digital presence are far more likely to be growing and recruiting I believe the same lessons apply to government and we will continue to increase our city with the fundamentals for an exceptional decade if our centenary year was a test of community spirit and culture this year will be a test of economic metal today I 've set out to make it clear that in our mind our economic program is inseparable from the broader agendas of livability productivity urban renewal and good public health I believe it 's our investments and advantages in these areas in precisely these areas which put us in good stead to respond to economic challenges and to overcome them as leaders in this city meeting this potential is a responsibility we all share thank you very much haha _"
