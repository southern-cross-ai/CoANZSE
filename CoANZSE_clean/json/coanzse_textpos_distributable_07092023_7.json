    "text": "[Music] i 've got a riddle for you what acts like a blanket in winter and esky in summer and will make your home more comfortable insulation of course it works by stopping the transfer of heat into and out of your home keeping it cooler in summer and warmer in winter with most households spending up to a third of their energy bill on heating and cooling it makes sense to ensure that your home is insulated to the best standard and to also be sure that it is airtight as possible the best time to do this is when planning the build also mention to the builder that you are going to have a door blower test conducted on the home and that you want the home to reach the relevant standards another way to ensure your insulation is right is to compare the r value the higher the r value the better the performance of the insulation look to install ceiling insulation wall insulation and if you 've got timber floorboards investigate the possibility of sub-floor insulation have your insulation inspected or safely inspected yourself just a 's like putting a jumper on and cutting holes in it it just doesn 't work blocking drafts mostly involves inexpensive materials and measures so it makes sense to do it yourself if you are capable or have access to a handyman given most households typically spend close to a third of their energy bills on heating and cooling we recommend getting a door blower test if your house is still leaky after you 've done all you can visually see or get a home energy assessment with a thermal camera when the gaps are identified you may be able to seal them up with a trip to the hardware store if a cooler quieter warmer and generally more comfortable house appeals to you fill those gaps and get your insulation right you _"

    "text": "hi i 'm shari from eden flower studio um and today we 're going to make a flower crown together uh we 'll need a few things for this we 'll need um some 22 gauge wires uh and some 26 gauge wires you can pick both these wires up from any local post we always have them on stock here we need some parafilm which is a florist tape i 'm going to use green today with my fresh flowers does come in white and brown as well so you can pick what color you want to use i 've got some flower cutters and some ribbon scissors and we 'll need some ribbon as well just to tie our flower crown at the back um or you can use some twine or whatever you want to tie it off with and then i 've just got a selection of flowers um i 've got some eucalyptus some chrysanthemum some asters some delphinium and some misting um you can use whatever flowers you like but keep them smaller heads nothing too big because otherwise it 'll be too heavy you 're making it um obviously any color scheme that you like um you can be as creative as you like i find flower crowns have been very popular for bridal showers baby showers um that 's our phone going off in the background um or even um for little girls for birthday parties um lots of occasions um you could make your flower crown for coming into spring um spring racing or just to have fun on the weekend um so to do the base of our flower crown i 'm going to use two of my 22 gauge wires which are the thicker wires that you 'll have and i 'm going to use them together just to reinforce it to make it a little bit um thicker now depending how far around your head you want to go um you could go just behind your ears which is what one length would do for me or we can add some more wire and make it go all the way around with my wires i 'm going to join them together using my power film now the power it 's not sticky but it does stick to itself um to make it sit to itself though we do need to make it a little bit warm so just warming it up behind between your fingers and your hand um even sticking it in your pocket if it 's too cold it 's not going to stick it 'll just um snap off while we use it but we also don 't want it to get too hot don 't leave it in your car or anything otherwise it 'll ruin it um to use it we need to stretch it a little bit so it almost goes um see-through and that 'll help it um stick to itself um so to cover my wires i hold the parafilm on with my thumb i am right-handed i hold it um with my left thumb and stretch it down the wire a little bit um so keeping um the paraffin stretched out just so that it goes a bit see-through and that 's where i twist it on so i twist the wire and with my right hand i 'm if it snaps off you can just start back up again where it snapped off layer it over so you don 't want to go too thick or not stretch it otherwise it 's going to be a bit chunky and it 's not going to stick to itself so stretching that nice and thin down the length of the wires when you first do it it will um snap a little bit it 's a bit tricky then at each end i 'm going to just do a little hook so that i 've got like a um like the eye of the needle um at the end and then i 'm going to power from that on so it just um connects it on there which will leave me with a little loop and that 's where at the end we 'll um thread our ribbon through um to be able to tie our cloud crown on and the same with my other end excuse my very dirty flower florist it 's been a busy day um okay so we should have a wire that has little loops the base of our crap now the fun part of adding all our flowers on so you can group your flowers you can evenly space them through i 'm going to add a little bit of foliage through mine as well to thicken it up you can have it quite thin and delicate or um quite cool and chunky the design is totally up to you so using my flower cutters [Music] i 'm going to start with a little bit of foliage with anything that 's um a good sturdy but thin stem i cheat a little bit and tape him straight on to um my forest wine don 't tell my tape teachers because they would have maybe wire every little piece of this but there 's no need to do so i 'm just going to take a selection of my flowers and i 'm just going to evenly disperse them over i 've got a little bit of a mixture of pastel colors for my one coming into spring and i 'm just going to layer each flower over the last so that i 'm covering lay the flower or the foliage on top of the wire that we 've just paraphiled remove any extra bits of foliage or anything on the stem so we 've got a nice clean stem and again like we covered our wire i 'm going to hold the parafilm down in my left hand with my right stretch it out and just twist it around the flower to tape it onto the original wire and it will also cover the stem of the flower which seals it and helps to keep as much moisture in there as possible so that our flower crown lasts for as long as possible obviously once we 're cutting the flowers off the stems and attaching them onto our crown they are out of water so it 's not going to last forever um it will only last a day or so um it can dry out a little bit um but using fresh flowers they are out of water so it 's not going to last that long um but covering the ends with the parafilm um seals the water in helps and lasts next flower i 'm just going to go over the top of where i taped and layer it over to the top to cover where i taped and tape the next flower on and that 's pretty much what we 're going to do all the way along the length of our wire is layering the flower over where we taped wrapping it up in that tape down the stem remembering to pull the power film over the stem until we 've covered the stem and then you can pull your tape off i 'm just going to continue to layer it [Applause] down [Music] mine 's getting a bit long now to work on my bench so i 've stepped away from the bench a little bit so that i have that length to twist spinning it around we 're coming towards the end [Music] of our wire once you do get towards the end of your wire where the um end loop is you just want to get as close to that end as possible so we don 't have too much wire on display this will be you don 't go over that loop because we need that loop to attach our ribbon um wherever we wanna tape right up to the end and that 's our flower crown so all i 'm going to do to finish it off is attach a bit of ribbon normally do about 40 centimeters worth through the little loop at the end [Music] tie in a couple of knots to secure no special trick to the knots just a couple of nice tight knots and then the other side the same thing i 'm trimming that ribbon off just so it 's nice and neat and the tails are the same at both ends and then we have our flower crown you can tie him at the back and there we have it that 's our flower crown i hope you enjoyed it _"

    "text": "[Music] [Music] so [Applause] [Music] welcome to macaria home of the alan baker art gallery come on in and have a look as you come into the gallery you 'll see our first few drawings of the charcoal exhibition we have over 40 works in this collection [Music] is our in the 60s 70s and 80s there was an art group called the camden art group it was all free no fees and people could just come and draw and the beauty of the exhibition and the art group itself is that because there were no fees the models were family members and um relatives or friends who would pose so that the whole idea of being in the group is that you bring someone to pose and to draw from life and and that was the most important things to work from life and finish the work as quickly as possible while that person was posing and sitting with you this is a drawing of ken rorke who is the instigator of the camden art group he was a primary school teacher down at the primary school hall and artist to be involved with the group and my father was more than willing to to help the local people as long as there were no fees so that was the beauty of the thing nobody had to collect money and everybody enjoyed the atmosphere and the talent that my father had to show the local people this is a drawing of how the group worked we worked in the primary school hall sitting in the um the primary school chairs old wooden chairs we used a high-powered light to put onto the model to get as many shadows as possible to understand the full tonal variance of full dark and full light these are portraits of my mother who posed many times for the art group this one in particular shows the the strength of the light to increase to show how you could make full use of the solid black of the charcoal and the light highlights onto the face it shows that you could learn your tonal variants very readily with charcoal members of the group brought their family and friends to to pose and this this of the their children posed um over here is an interesting collection it shows the dress of the day of the 60s 70s the way the people dressed i find that fascinating some drawings are done uh longer than others like this has been done probably half an hour then you move on to this one which has probably been done in an hour and a half or so the class only sat 7 30 till 9 o 'clock they had a couple of breaks in between and the models obviously needed a break between each sitting so this is a more finished piece and you go through to you know a half size head full full-size head over there this is a lovely piece of the girl looking down you know it has a lovely feel about it but using the full tones um and this one here come on aussies come on that 's a lovely piece of history isn 't everyone remembers the cricket expression and this fellow here you can see that he 's uh he 's a little bit uh tired i think and he got a lovely expression on the face and this one here with a lovely old old jumper there with charcoal you can get the full the full tonal values which is quite quite different to all the graphics and of course this guy over here this is an early one of me so that would be uh yeah 1973. this is a portrait of um his name was beaver they called him but rita bloomfield was one of the artist members of the group and she worked did a lot of work for bullen 's animal world over at waragamba and she brought along a lot of the circus characters that used to work it for bullons this fellow dressed up as a red indian he used to shoot knives at his wife who used to be the the model the paper we used for charcoals is an engraved paper it 's a very tough paper because you have to get the charcoal to actually absorb into the paper so it doesn 't float away so you 'd get a paper stump and you could rub it in or you that just shows how most of the students worked with oils watercolours or whatever medium they chose but my father did most of his in the charcoals a very hard medium to manage but you could see he was a master of it charcoal is one of the oldest mediums that humans have used it 's just a bit of burnt stick and you can draw on the wall cavemen drew them on the walls this is made from either willow or grape vines and you just burn them in a fire with without oxygen often put them in a tin can and you can create your own charcoal now you can get different colours you get black and you can get brownie colors but it 's the most basic medium that an artist could use when you do your charcoal you have a paper roll which is called a paper stump and you can use that to push the paper push the charcoal into the paper so i 'll just show you an example when you put you can start with a fine point to do your lines of how black it goes it can go to the full black and then of course with your paper stump then you can push it harder to get the half tones so that 's how how when you 're working with charcoal you can go from full black right out to your full half tones and you can almost using it like oil paint on the special engraved paper so it has so many uses and of course it 's also very dirty but you can use your your chamois and you can lift it off again so you can lift it off and create all the tones so the works that you 've seen earlier you can show how my father 's worked with that he 's put it on he 'd use a stump and he could lift off he could change change the colors you can draw you can use you can use big pieces to really cover it like that you can work very quickly we can use a fine little piece you can do the delicate little lines so it just shows you how charcoal you use your full tone so it 's a fascinating medium all of these drawings and charcoal drawings have been done from life we always work from real people and a real environment so that you experience not only their changes they get tired they move and you get that in the drawings you can show this girl she 's reading a book but it just shows you how she 's just posing there there 's nothing artificial a camera actually creates an instant in time it 's half a second of photos taken a drawing like this is a length of time it 's done over a period and so it changes it has a life of its own so i 'd encourage anybody to come and have a look at the collection in life and view the exhibition because it has a whole new meaning to seeing you know from a video screen so come along to the gallery enjoy the exhibition you _"

    "text": "um so welcome everyone to um our webinar on the draft kansan economic development strategy my name is v gorgeous i 'm the coordinator for economy and place and um the strategy was very much developed by my team and its actions and deliverables will be um delivered by my team so i 'm very pleased and and proud to be presenting this um significant piece of work to you today before i begin i would just like to do an acknowledgement to count country um council acknowledges the daryl people as the traditional custodians of the land on which camden sits and we pay our respects to their elders past present and emerging and also i extend my respects to any aboriginal or torres strait islander people in the call today um before we begin just giving you a bit of an overview of how the webinar is going to run today um just a little bit of a welcome first off hello and then taking you into a bit of a contextual kind of um framing before we actually talk about strategy so we 'll be talking about context um the consultation um summary so before we put together the strategy we actually went out and consulted with the community and i 'll just be sharing some insights from that and then of course an overview of the draft strategy itself there are of course opportunities for q a in fact i welcome it and so at the moment if you can see your the q a panel in your zoom setup if you have any questions as we go along um please just put your questions in the q a and i will respond to them at the end of the presentation at the moment the webinar is being recorded and all attendees are muted um but if you would like to actually ask your question at the end of the presentation you can also raise your hand with that handy button in zoom and then one of um our little gremlins in the back will unmute you and so we can have a bit of a chat so yeah we 'll just get started um i guess it 's a really good place to start to and place making council plays three key roles in these areas one of them is to facilitate economic growth and that includes enabling activities which attract investment create employment opportunities and encourage the growth of innovative and future focused industries another um thing that we do and through facilitation is strategy development such as the one you 're hearing about today and these strategies that we develop across council are plans to support and encourage investment jobs growth and vibrant centers we also undertake partnerships with diverse stakeholders to help deliver infrastructure facilities and services that will benefit our communities and then we also provide for local infrastructure and assets which are fundamental for business operations and place vitality these include streets roads amenities and public domain assets and of course community facilities and then we also undertake land use planning and that 's that long-term planning that develops um looks to develop existing and future centers and employment lands that will help to build that in that employment of diversity and develop camden as that attractive place for investment and finally we also deliver events and activations which help a place to live work and grow the second role that council plays in economic development is to support growth and that includes business support which includes information sharing communication between businesses and councils and assisting businesses through crises such as the pandemic of course um capacity building is also a big part of this we and it includes um the provision of opportunities for businesses to learn and develop and to connect and collaborate in order to grow their businesses and also to grow the broader business community we also play a big part in encouraging the development of vibrant places which will enhance and diversify our liveability offerings and finally we collaborate with agencies and organizations to deliver a range of economic development activities including investment attraction business support networking and education and training finally um council 's third role is in influencing economic growth um that includes a very large um a big focus on advocacy to stay in federal governments and organizations and of course to industry bodies for a range of populations serving an employment generating infrastructure that will help council and camden to grow doing business in camden also promotion of the camden lga as a great place to live work study and visa and then finally research and data gathering to really understand the range of factors that will support and enhance economic activity in camden so that 's the role of council broadly what we do in the economy and place team is we really have that focus on economic development and place making and really looking at economic growth within that play space with that place-based approach and being quite bespoke and responsive to the regional and local context in which we are so that includes business support and liaising um partnering with different organizations and collaborating to deliver on our activities investment attraction capacity building strategy development city marketing business events place activations and research and insights so as we go along you 'll see that these um these activities will be reflected in our economic development strategy and then of course reflected in the things that we will be delivering over the course the next four years um camden of course doesn 't sit by itself in a silo would say one of the more exciting regional contexts in the country at the moment um not only are we a part of the metropolis of three cities we 're sitting within that greater sydney commission plan for the metropolis of three cities but i would again say we 're in the most exciting of those three cities which is the western city district um so these are the um the the key um state government plans that really um look at building the region for western sydney and camden is at the heart of that region and then of course um in conjunction with that western sydney plan is also the western sydney city deal which is a deal a partnership between state federal and local governments to be delivering on the infrastructure and the population and the investment opportunities that will come from the western sydney investment sorry the western sydney international airport and then at the local level our key strategies and that really define what we do and and and how we do it is um our community strategic plan and the camden local strategic planning outline our 10 and 20 year visions for camden lj over the next that many years sorry and and really align align that vision in context of the regional growth that 's taking place so those are the key strategies that um that the economic development strategy has been aligned with and then there are also um some secondary or supporting strategies that we have we also have sought to align ourselves um with as much as possible and that includes the sydney 24-hour economy strategy the new south wales visitor economy strategy and the new south wales 2040 economic blueprint and then at the local level it 's the camden town centre urban design framework and the draft campaign centers in employment land strategy as well as other strategies within council but of course i can 't fit them all on one slide um and then just looking at camden 's economic profile um it 's really great to um to know and to share with you the fact that camden um despite the pandemic um over the last two years has been relatively unscathed and so um in we had over 40 000 local jobs and over 60 000 employed residents and then in the year um ending june 2021 we had over 10 000 local businesses and that 's a growing number so so despite the pandemic the amount of businesses coming to camden was still growing um oops sorry um and then of course our largest value-added industries were construction retail trade and rental hiring and real estate services as one of the fastest growing lgas in australia it is very unsurprising that these population serving industries would be our would be our strongest as well because they really are growing in step with that population growth and looking to serve that population growth across a range of areas similarly the top three industries for local employment so this is where local people are employed in the industries our retail trade construction and accommodation and food services um and then that really means that canada 's key sectors and industries as we go forward are construction retail trading rental hiring and real estate services and so we 're really in a good position to be um only the airport but also from the growth of the western sydney region itself and that means that our visitor economy as we all know we have some really amazing assets in camden the visitor economy has that great opportunity to leverage and grow in step with our population and regional growth looking forward into the future um we 've identified in the strategies some key sectors and industries of the future the ones that will be quite responsive to those rapid regional changes and and the in the international opportunities that will come from being at the doorstep of an international airport and these are also industries for which we are well placed to grow within camden and that includes agribusiness in horticulture food science and food technology education and training transport and infrastructure advanced manufacturing healthcare and circular economy so um for example agribusiness and horticulture um a very direct link to um the growth and that that will take place there in in conjunction with the western sydney airport is that there 's real opportunities for a farm to have grown their crops harvest it get it international location within 24 hours of being harvested and so those are some really great opportunities that are coming on board that we 're very excited to be um supporting so as i mentioned before and the development of the economic development strategy was also quite um influenced and and um influenced by the consultations that we undertook so we undertook a series of consultation activities and those included targeted online surveys to businesses and industry groups also a broader online community survey regarding placement issues and really asking the community about what matters to them in terms of their place in the centers and that they live and work and play in and we also delivered a webinar for businesses and stakeholders to talk through our plans and and to get their feedback and then of course a much more deeper dive through in-person workshops which i know some of you attended um where we really looked at what the priorities um and and in the areas of improvement were for businesses um and then of course the consultation with internal stakeholders throughout camden council which there are many were business engagement capacity building employment pathways investment attraction and vibrant centers and precincts um and then very hearteningly um it was nice to find out that everybody loves camden and it really is the place to be so um in our place survey 77 of respondents indicated that they feel a part of the camden lga community and in our business survey 100 of respondents identified the canton local community as a key opportunity for businesses and i know that many of you um here today are camden locals and you live and work in kansas and i know that you do feel that really strong business i mean that really strong community connection um throughout camden as well so it 's really great to see that it 's been reflected in both our place and our business surveys so on to the main event which is the economic development strategy itself um this strategy will um will outline what we do over the next 20 up sorry about 20 over the next four years from 2022 to 2026 so i 'm just going to go through um the reminder that if anybody has any questions as we go please do put them into the q a section and then we will respond to them i respond to them at the end of this presentation so first of all the vision of the strategy is to leverage camden 's local strengths and emerging regional advantages to promote attractive and livable places stimulate economic and employment growth and foster a vibrant diversified and technologically advanced economy so this vision really looked to acknowledge the local strengths that camden currently has that very strong community and sense of community and therefore the very strong local business community and then also look to um acknowledge and identify our emerging regional advantages and really placing us in that regional context of being part of that western parkland city and therefore being in a really good position to leverage off the growth and the opportunities that come from that um moving on the strategy is underpinned by six principles these principles um are as you go you will have strategic directions and deliverables and each of those um deliverables are aligned to one of how we both plan and implement the strategy so our principles for this strategy are support collaboration leverage promotion place and innovation um the strategy then has four strategic directions which um actually align very closely to those key key themes that came from the consultation we really did hear you in that consultation and seek to really reflect the um the needs and the demands and you know and the opportunities that came from those consultations into our strategic directions so those are to facilitate business and industry growth to strengthen education training and career pathways to attract investment to the region and to support the development of vibrant places i 'm now just going to go through and outline the key priorities that are aligned to each of these four principles so each i 'm sorry not principle strategic directions so each of the strategic directions then has five principles um oh my god i am mincing my words i do apologize so each strategic direction then has five um priorities that we will then deliver across the four um four years and these priorities will then manifest facilitate business and industry industry growth the first um priority for that is to understand the makeup and characteristics of the current canton lga business ecosystem through effective data capture and analysis to keep businesses informed of trends and changes in economic industry and government landscapes to promote camden lga 's unique and diverse offerings to its residents workers students and visitors provide opportunities for capacity building to local businesses through a range of industries and to investigate the establishment of flexible work hubs across the canton lga so that provision of opportunities for capacity building was a very strong one that came through in the in the businesses really want to have more access to information and to opportunities to learn and to grow their businesses and also to learn and grow from each other so i 'm really hap pleased about that particular priority because it means that we are able to we will be able to deliver quite bespoke responses to the business community about the things that you you say you 'd like um you know capacity building and support and growth in our next direction priorities that come from that are to understand the existing landscape for education and training opportunities within the camden lga to engage with local businesses to understand education and training needs and requirements by industry segment to collaborate with stakeholders to deliver education training and career pathway programs across a range of industries to provide opportunities to accelerate youth employment in the camden lga to advocate to expand tertiary education and training options across the camden lga again this um this direction was very much in response to a lot of business feedback that said that there is quite a um a gap in skills development and in career pathways for a range of people at different parts of their careers but more but quite and and then also quite specifically for young people so a lot of businesses said to us that they were struggling to find um the apprentices and and you know to find people who would come into their industries and and engage with them as more than just part-time casual work um and so this direction and its priorities really seek to respond to that in the skills and careers development and so the only way to really effectively respond to that is to actually talk to the businesses and the industries and find out what it is that you need and then to work with our stakeholders and also with other partners to look to deliver that for you i can 't promise that will deliver everything but that is definitely the spirit of what this um this direction is about and it 's really to that to therefore grow that crop of local employees who then live and work in the camden lga our next strategic direction is to attract investment to the region this includes investigating and supporting opportunities to leverage of future industrial and commercial hubs of the eretropolis promote let camden lga as an attractive place for business industry and government investment continue to collaborate with all three tiers of government in the delivery of economic outcomes associated with the western sydney city deal investigate opportunities to attract and encourage the delivery of social services and infrastructure and investigate the appropriate types of visitor accommodation for canton and identify appropriate as you can see from its title is very much about that regional focus about positioning camden as a as a strong player regionally and even nationally and really leveraging off the um that growth that comes from one of all firstly just being the first one of the fastest growing lgas in australia so that really strong population growth and that we have but also that growth that comes from being in such close proximity to one of a major international airport and also its surrounding eratropolis so we 're really looking to investigate all of the ways that um all the opportunities that exist within camden now and also into the future that will enable us to leverage off um those opportunities from the airport and aerotropolis and again to build industries and businesses in camden to keep the jobs locally and then finally um the last um strategic direction is to support the development of vibrant places i call this the fun direction not that the others won 't be fun either but this one is the super fun one um and it 's because it includes also implementing the camden town centre urban design framework in camden town centre vision supporting the development of night of the night time economy within canada 's existing and emerging centres supporting and encouraging the delivery of events through the canteen lga and collaborating across council to support a place-based approach to the development of camden strategic and local centres so this strategy is really all about acknowledging that we are a great place to be in that camden has some really amazing things to do and some really awesome centers that you can explore and not only that but we 'll have some really awesome centers coming up again as one of the fastest growing lgas we are building a lot of new centers that um will be catering to that um growing population and so it 's really ensuring that those centres are being developed um with that place-based approach and that people-centered approach that ensures that they have the right amenities in the right public domain um settings and then also the right offerings for people who both live and work against and then also visit camden within those centres that attract people and attract visitors and residents into the centers and you know bring that extra business to the centers as well so that 's why it 's fun we get to put on events and do activations and do some really fun things in that one um so that 's the end of the presentation and now we 're going to move into um the q a just to remind you again please put your questions into the q a um section and i will answer them and see that one 's come up in the chat so i 'll obviously answer that as well um but also if you 'd like to speak to your question please raise your hand um virtually of course and then we will unmute you and we 'll have a bit of a chat about it but the first question has come through and it 's too sorry i 'm just making that can you please share more information about the growth of food science and food technology yes um so i can share a little bit of information of the areas that we do hope to explore over the next couple of years and really get a better understanding of but in general the growth of food science and food technology is really about looking at those innovative ways to grow food we have not just a growing population in canada but a growing population worldwide and and then of course in australia and one of the um one of the key challenges for any kind of food production is how to grow food safely effectively but also quickly and to get them as fresh as possible and to get food produce as fresh as possible to the people who will be eating it and so there is a lot of um there 's a lot of work happening um with food science and food technology behind the scenes um we have the sydney university 's agricultural center based just on the outskirts of camden that 's working on this the csiro has also um signed on to be a big um a huge like a major tenet within the eratropors and it 's those kinds of big of research and investigation in like you know on the on the outskirts of camden or in the western parkland city and then um as that happens what follows will that they will attract the the additional investment and additional businesses to our area that will then actually be delivering on on on the the research that 's found there and one of those really great things about camden is that we do have such vast um rural lands and also a lot of farms and agricultural activities so we 're really well placed to be leveraging off and learning from those findings and then delivering on that local investment in local jobs so i hope that answers your question um the next question is in what ways is councils supporting activities and opportunities at night or after work hours um so i 'd like to say that it 's also about having a good drink after work um and the activities are activities around the nighttime economy we 'll definitely be definitely be looking at encouraging our existing businesses to be open later and to because when we have that people have certainty about there being an offering for them when they go to that place and therefore it kind of just is self-fulfilling and and you know means that more people will come in there for more business um businesses open later and then of course attracting more businesses but of course there 's also broadly on the strategic um front the greatest the sydney 24-hour economy strategy and there are some really um great um actions and deliverables within that strategy and i do commend the people who wrote that strategy because usually when they talk about sydney 's 24-hour economy it 's really about central like the cbd or sydney but this strategy really does acknowledge um that sydney and greater sydney has the potential to have great nighttime economies as well and camden was quite um instrumental in helping to develop that and to really be advocating for western sydney to be noted and to be acknowledged and to be um considered in this plan and so the plan itself does um outline a range of actions and deliverables to be delivered across um greater closely with the 24-hour economy commissioners team to be looking at how those um strategies can be um implemented here in camden and then just very quickly as well it 's things like um the development of leopington town center at the moment it 's just a giant green field but it will be the closest city center to the airport when it 's actually up and running and so um there is a lot of um work happening behind the scenes in terms of the review of that center in terms of how it can be developed in the best possible way with the highest and best uses and um again we 're advocating very strongly for nighttime uses in that space because if you think about it if you get off the air you know you land on western sydney airport and then you go to the like with the closest accommodation in the closest city you 're probably going to go to lexington and if you land at two in the morning you 're gonna wanna at least to get a cup of coffee somewhere around there 're really looking to encourage throughout in new centers like lexington but then also in our existing centers like camden i hope that answers your question um the next question that 's popped up is my child has recently finished their hsc what support will there be for youth employment thanks for that question um it 's a really important question because again camden being that fast-growing lga we have a lot of young families here and those young families obviously hope to be staying in camden for as long as possible in those young families then grow up to have adolescents and and then um more families and so what we 're trying to do so so what we 've really identified as an area of need is that support for youth employment and it 's not just within the economic development strategy but also a um council will be releasing a draft youth strategy very soon and unsurprisingly youth employment is of key um key issue and area for action within that strategy and so some of the things that we 'll be doing at first in the next year i will have dates and all the information for you very shortly um you know when we can announce it but we 'll be doing um careers expo which brings together local employers um registered training organizations and services to um present to young people students as well as young job seekers on how what the opportunities are available for them um within the region and then of course that so that 's in the short term and then in the long term we 'll be looking at working with local schools and also tafe um to to be and then also businesses to really be understanding those um those training gaps in and and really the knowledge gaps as well in terms of where do people want i mean in terms of what do students or young people even know about what the career opportunities are for them and really looking to be um promoting those and giving them really uh really practical information and next steps towards that and then of course slowly you know that we don 't have a tertiary education institution within canton our strategy is to really be advocating for that that kind of institution to be located within camden we definitely can 't promise that it 'll happen but i will definitely try my my darkness to make it happen um so uh the next question is how is council attracting suitable businesses in camden town centre as there has been an increase in vacant shop fronts um that 's a really good question and i really do acknowledge the hardship and and the difficulty that local businesses have experienced over the last two years i mean it 's really great to know statistically that camden actually hasn 't_''_1842.799 been as badly impacted as say the rest of greater sydney or even the rest of new south wales but it 's um it 's one thing to know that but then another thing to also know that businesses are struggling still um and even if though you 're struggling less and maybe others you are still struggling and it has really manifested itself in those kinds of vacant shop fronts and in the um the closure of many businesses so i really tough question and it isn 't and it 's also not a thing not an issue that is as you can imagine um just about just localized to camden lga is all over australia dealing with this and this is where um council 's role as an influencer comes in that 's not as an instagram influencer but it 's um as an influencer in the way that i mentioned in a previous slide about council 's three roles the council 's three roles are facilitating supporting and influencing economic growth and this is where that comes in things like vacant shop fronts are very much privately driven and market driven so it 's not a matter for council to be able to just go and be like hey come this business come here and rent a spot here we don 't own those buildings so um so we really have quite limited ability to actually act in that very direct way but what we can do is the things that i kind of have mentioned already those deliverables and priorities that i kind of mentioned already throughout um around um activate activating our town centres around um you know building up youth employment and also about capacity buildings businesses so that to to really mitigate against businesses feeling overwhelmed um to give them the tools and the support that they need to firstly stay in camden and then of course to um to create tools and support for businesses who are looking to grow to open up in camden but not too sure how to how to do it we we will be we we hope to be that one place that they can come to that gives them that that support that that tells them that if you open up a business in camden you 're going to be okay you 're going to feel safe you 're going to feel supported and that also includes introducing them to the amazing business community that we already have um so those are the influencing kind of levers that council has to to be um addressing that kind of vacant shop front vacancy and then of course it 's also talking with landowners and shop owners um about you well again we can 't solve every problem i wish we could it would just make everything easier but we certainly have and we 'll be pulling out all of the levers available to us to ensure that we both retain the businesses that we already have and then attract the businesses that we want into the area that would then of course attract more businesses so i hope that answers that question for you the next question is within the strategy outlines council is encouraging the development of vibrant places which enhance and diversify camden 's livability offering just wondering what vibrant places means that is a very good question and i think it 's really important to know that vibrant places means something different something a little bit different at every kind of place because a place is very um needs to be very specific and very responsive to the people that inhabit it um for example if it 's a a place that is like has a very strong um kind of youth um usage like you know if it 's a very youth dominated place you makes it vibrant would be very different to if it 's a place that 's quite dominated and has a high usage by seniors um but at the heart of it a vibrant place is a place that is um inviting to as many people as possible and enables people as many people as possible to feel safe and to feel welcome um and and to feel connected when they arrive there so at um at its most basic it 's about having those very basic public domain amenities that makes people feel safe and invited so it means about having you know good lighting good access to public transport or good access to parking it 's about having um the things that people need to use like shops retail services like centrelink or or service in south wales um cafes restaurants all of those things within a walking distance so so people can just get out there and go to use the things that they need to use um and then i mean it 's also having more public domain like seating and shade and just those kinds of to be in and then of course once you have that the next kind of layer of vibrancy would be the activity that 's involved in it so a vibrant place would be a place that has you know what we call at least 10 things to do um so can you get a cup of coffee and then go for a bit of a shop on a wonder around town are there things for people to do that are free like is there a playground for kids to hang out in um you know can someone just sit and just enjoy themselves without having to you know do anything um and then um when we talk about the nighttime economy it 's a place that 's vibrant at night as well it 's a place where people and families feel really safe at night and they feel like there 's something for them to do if they were to go there um and it 's it 's a place where people can can see the difference the transition between day and night where there 's a lot to do at night time there 's also heaps to do and there 's also amenities and services that they need as well so vibrancy is a really kind of it 's a catch-all but it means something different at every place and so that 's why we have a very place-based approach to developing our centers really looking at the people who are currently using it and will be using it and then looking to develop them in in such a way that as many people as possible can be using them so yeah ah um there 's is there any other questions just got a a bit of a comment um relating to um my answer before hang on here we go i came to detail um so can you detail what will happen regarding the aerotrophic development as regardless in the university lands and proposed relocation unfortunately i cannot detail that that is um would be a private matter for sydney university um we can certainly find out um what 's going on there but at the moment we don 't have that information so i do apologize for and can you please share who we can contact with council with business ideas and feedback me contact me me and my entire team um i should have probably said um introduced my team um at the beginning and said that we do have a full economy and place team who is ready here and ready to to support you in any way so there 's me um coordinator of economy in place and then we 've also got a senior officer economic growth um a place activation officer a city marketing officer and a program support officer and so even within those kinds of titles you can see how our positions and what we do really align to um the strategic

    "text": "uh now we 're back uh so with here we 're here with um a do we call you like a clinician or um and that so we 're here with um someone from headspace so this is josh say hi hello hey how you going thanks for having me oh thank you for joining us um so do we call you like a clinician or something else what 's the best way to introduce you i mean technically my job title is youth access clinician so that 's probably the safest thing to go with i guess all right okay sweet um so might as well start off with a couple of questions and i 'll pass it over to marley molly do you have a couple of questions you like to ask yeah i do hi everyone i 'm marley i 'm part of um cam youth action team um and i just got a question for you josh so for someone who hasn 't heard of headspace what services do you offer for young people yeah so essentially where i mean for anyone between 12 and 25 you might need basically so obviously the biggest thing that we 're known for and the kind of biggest thing we do is support for mental health so we have psychologists and other mental health workers on board that can kind of help people with all sorts of mental health issues um but we 're also here to help with a range of other different stuff too and basically any sort of issues that you might be facing as a young person we 're here to try and support so for instance at our headspace center in campbelltown we 've got a gp um so doctor we 've got an alcohol a drug clinician uh we 've got a dietitian we 've even got a driving instructor linkedin as well oh wow they 're great yeah so we got heaps of stuff and i guess most importantly for people to know as well is that even if we 're not able to provide you know a particular service ourselves we can always help someone link in with that service as well so even if we don 't actually have the we can always help you find whatever help you do need so we like to think we can help with just about any issue that a young person might be going through yeah that 's so great um and joshua there 's obviously so many services out there that you guys offer um but for young people how can we actually access those ones yeah so look a lot of the young people get involved with headspace um they might be referred by a doctor or a school counselor um so those are kind of some of the common ways but to be honest anyone can get involved you don 't have to be referred by another professional what you can do is just give us a call so for campbelltown our number is 46279089 um but obviously if you 're listening from a different area your headspace would have a different number you can just google it but if you just call up and just say hey i 'd like to take someone or i need some assistance um that 's all you need to do and then um with that into motion pretty much yeah that 's so great um and say someone um when went to go for a first meeting with you guys at headspace what would they expect yeah so what we do is once someone has been referred or has called up i guess the first step is to get a phone call from our intake officer so our intercost is a guy called ben and what he 'll do is he 'll give you a phone call um and have a quick chat maybe a 15 20 minute conversation just to kind of get a sense of what is actually going on for you and what 's kind of been happening um and the point of that is just to kind of see whether you know headspace can help you out necessarily whether we what service we 've got that would be able to help you or whether to see that maybe another service might be more appropriate or might be kind of more able to support you and so what he 'll do is if you are kind of really appropriate for pass it along to the clinicians if it 's not necessarily the most appropriate or there is another service that would be better then what he 'll do is help you link him with that service and kind of organize that for you and once it 's kind of gone along to one of our clinicians we 'll organize an appointment and then that first appointment will basically just be a conversation with you and one of the youth access clinicians so what my role um and the other people in my role and what we 'll do is have a conversation with you try to get a sense of what is going on for you what issues you 're facing kind of build a big picture so we do ask a lot of questions to try and make sure we 're not missing anything make sure we 've got everything covered um so we do understand really what 's going on so that we can provide the best support for you um and then at the end of that appointment what we 'll do is we 'll make a these are the options these are how we can help based on what you 've told me and then if we 're both on the same page then we 'll kind of proceed from there but it always depends on what the young person wants and what they 're kind of looking for as well we 're not going to tell you this is what 's going to happen we 'll kind of suggest things and talk about everything and then once we kind of are on the same page then we 'll make that happen yeah thanks also it sounds really a really amazing um platform that you 've got there for people um and a question that i guess a lot of people have asked is um if they actually talk to a clinician at headspace will their friends and family find out what they 've spoken about yeah so i mean that 's obviously a big issue that lots of people are wondering about all worried about and the answer is no they 're not going to find out what you talk about everything is completely confidential of very small specific exceptions to that um which it 's important to be aware of and this is always explained to you by the headspace clinician as well at the start so you 'll always be made aware of this but the only times we can break confidentiality is if you 're in harm or there 's potential risk for danger to you or someone else because our main role is to keep you safe so if there is any chance of danger or harm we may need to tell someone um now if you 're planning to commit a serious crime and you tell us that there 's a serious crime going to happen we might need to tell someone as well but that 's only in um extreme facebook so if you 're planning to rob a bank look we might have to mention something to someone yeah good idea good idea and the only other thing we can tell someone is if there 's a court case going on and a judge wanted to see our notes um if a judge pain is that we can time we can actually tell someone what 's been talked about um in session pretty much yeah well that 's that 's pretty good um let 's hope no one 's going to rob bank okay look i always appreciate when they kind of tell me that that 's not the case um so do you reckon um in your job josh is there a big stigma around mental health um and how can we as young people and as a society reduce that stigma around the mental health yeah and there there absolutely is unfortunately i think there has been a lot of progress and we um do see more and more young people being able to ask for help and feeling more comfortable with it but i mean with mental health there always has been and it and it continues on um and i guess in terms of what we can do to help kind of reduce that or help deal with that i guess one of the big things for me is we 've got to make it normal to seek help um and so that starts that um go get help if you need it go ask help don 't be afraid to because then once you start to do that your friends see that your family sees that we make it more normal um to do to do that to get help because i think a lot of what people do is they 'll tell their friends yeah guys go get help it 's fine um go do it but then they won 't do it themselves and people see that and people notice that and it kind of increases that stigma and it kind of adds to it a bit um and i think one of the other things we need to do is we need to kind of make it a bit more normal or a bit more okay that when people are acting strange or acting different or have stuff going on that we kind of allow that to happen without judging or without um kind of criticizing or laughing at people because that increases the stigma as well so once we see someone acting a bit different we kind of talk 're acting a bit weird um and why would that person go get help because now they think oh everyone thinks i 'm crazy everyone thinks i 'm weird i 'm just to hide away and i 'm not going to kind of actually try to address that yeah 100 and they need to feel confident to actually go out there and ask for it that 's exactly right um yeah so i think just normalizing some of that kind of making it okay to be not okay and making it okay to get help and that starts with like i said starts with us people listening starts with everybody just to be able to take that first step show that that 's the behavior that 's appropriate and show that it 's okay and then that 's how that kind of stigma will over time be reduced hopefully yeah well that 's good let 's hope it is in the future um so another question is what are the most common uh mental health concerns or conditions that you see that are found in young people yeah um so on i guess for me one of the biggest ones absolutely is anxiety because i mean being being a young person going through school growing up getting older things are changing you know you 've got to kind of look to the future it 's scary and a lot of young people get anxiety as a result because there is just so much changing and so much happening and it can be hard to deal with or hard to process so definitely anxiety is such a big thing that young people as a whole are going through um we do also see a lot of young people with with depression um just because again suddenly life gets tougher and those stressful things just hit more and they affect us more and more and it 's kind of you know when you 're younger you don 't quite have the capacity to deal with it necessarily or you might be thrown out on your own um without the support that you need and so that does affect us a lot so anxiety and depression are huge things that we see all lots of other stuff as well there 's um you know self-harm there might be addiction um issues because young people are kind of exploring different ways to cope with things or you know being exposed to the world and suddenly there 's all these new experiences um so there is there is a lot of things that young people are going through same as adults um experiencing all kinds of things but definitely anxiety and depression are absolutely the biggest things to see in young people yeah well thank you so much joshua for that i 'll hand it back to hermione and yeah um so going going off that question um as we live through these uncertain times you know with um covert 19 um hsc especially um what are your top three picks um for relieving tension and stress uh and some methods in coping with anxiety panic attacks and all that yeah so i mean it is a pretty uncertain time at the moment is a scary time no one really knows what 's going on how to how to cope with everything at the moment have talked about is don 't be afraid to ask for help if you need it don 't be afraid to get help speak to people um you know because if we try and go through this alone this time going through particularly yeah people doing the hsc or you know coping with this pandemic trying to find work whatever it is if you try and go it alone you 're going to struggle so don 't be afraid to ask for help when you need it don 't be afraid to get support whatever it is that you need another thing i 'd say is the importance of self-care importance of looking after yourself taking time for yourself because if we get caught up and we 're kind of spending all day panicking and all day struggling with what we 're going through you 're just not giving yourself a break and you 're not going to be able to kind of deal with it and it 's going to build up and it 's going to affect you more so take some time um you know what whatever spend some time with them forget about your problems for a sec don 't feel guilty about that it 's it 's so important um and i guess the last one i 'd say is always live a healthy lifestyle um eat well get keep your sleeping routine good exercise all that kind of stuff and i know we hear this all the time and always being told healthy lifestyle but it is stuff that does help keep us on track stuff it keeps help keep i can 't talk keeps our brain active and functioning well and just keeps us kind of yeah on track to kind of deal with the stresses that we deal with um every day yeah yeah i 100 agree with all that um so very recently camden council has completed their youth survey and from that it was it like they found that 82 percent of young people that were surveyed turn to their friends when they need support with that in mind we thought we would like to ask you a couple of questions about that and how to best support our friends signs that they might need some help might just professional help so our first question is is that if one of my friends isn 't being themselves how can i best support them yeah and that 's i mean something we often see you know with our friends when we 're at school or whatever else that have people do go through stuff and they do seem a bit different but we 're not sure how to kind of address that um and so one of the things that 's most important to do is to give someone the space to talk at their own pace and at their own um you know give them the control of it um rather than trying to force them into something rather than trying to force them to talk to you um which might put them under more pressure and make them feel more stressed is just give them that space so in terms of supporting someone through something like that um yeah i to let them know that they always have a space ask them if they 're okay um and if of have that and allow them to kind of sit back and do it whenever they feel ready um another thing is being non-judgmental whatever they could tell you it 's so important to go in with the kind of mind frame that you can accept whatever they tell you um that it 's okay and that you normalize it because people even with our friends we do get worried they 're gonna judge us we do get worried they 're gonna think we 're weird with um you know whatever we 're going through and so it 's so important that you make them aware that they can tell you anything and it 's okay and whatever they tell you um you will you 'll support them um but also remember like i said is that you know if they don 't want to talk about it that 's okay because they might just want to be normal they might you know for them going to school or being with friends might be their escape from whatever they 're going through so sometimes the best way of supporting someone life as it is still make sure they 're okay still check in but allow them just to kind of feel normal allow them to kind of keep up with everything because once you start making things feel a bit weird for them um then then they might not want to talk or they might not be comfortable getting getting support um and then if you do create that safe space for them to talk if you do kind of make things normal not judgmental when they 're ready to seek help then you know one of the best ways to support them is to kind of actually help them with that so because when someone is going through something or they 're struggling they might think i don 't know what what to do i don 't know what comes next it 's all too much that 's when you can help them out you know call headspace or get them some help or google you know what services are available or go talk to a school counselor or whatever it might be actually help them um when they of make that happen um but it 's important to go at their pace it 's important not to force them into anything and it 's important just to be yeah non-judgmental and give them a safe place to talk when they need it yeah yeah um so another question is is that what are some of the warning signs that my friend or myself for that matter care that can be yeah so i mean in terms of the warning signs it 's important remember that sometimes there are no warning signs as well um is that sometimes people might be fine from the outside they might look like everything 's going perfectly and they are struggling so it is important to remember that there are not necessarily warning signs for much health issues but i mean that said sometimes there is and there often is and some of the things you might look out for um it 's just i mean you know everyone knows their friends well just differences just their behavior might be different so for instance if they stop hanging out they stop turning up withdraw from things that 's often kind of a bit of a bit of a warning sign um they might be struggling with their emotions or their temper you know they might be getting angry quite easily um they might you know seem a bit low or they might seem tired or distracted a lot of the time um you know that you might they might have told you about changes in their sleep so for instance they 're not sleeping well anymore or even they 're eating suddenly they 're eating a lot or they not eating at all like they 're skipping meals um any of those kind of differences like that from from what they normally are um another one is kind of if they 're starting to drink or take drugs you know a lot more than they used to what they 've started doing new things um that can be a bit of a warning sign um and i mean another one is self-harm um if you have noticed scars or anything like that that is you know obviously a big warning sign as well 't see our friends going through that but that unfortunately is sometimes yeah that bit of a warning sign that we might be able to notice um when it happens yeah yeah um so if my friend is going through something and they won 't seek professional help um how can we still best help them and assist them um other than what we 've discussed before and like the best support so how can we still help them out yeah and that 's i mean that is tough when someone doesn 't want help or they 've said no i don 't want support because the other day you can 't_''_1077.6 force someone to do something they don 't want to do even if you think it 's in their best interest you just you can 't_''_1082.48 force it they 'll resist and they 'll push back and you might threaten them off getting help ever um so look obviously people know again people know their friends make that judgment at the time but um what you can do is check in with them um make sure you 're that if if they 're not okay that they 've got a space to talk so kind of continually check in not all the time don 't force it on them but just say you know are you doing okay how is thing how is everything going um it 's important to make sure that they are safe and their physical needs are being met so you know while they might not want help just to check in are things at home okay you are being looked after you 're not hurting yourself you 're not in any danger that 's something to kind of always just make sure you 're monitoring um like i said before be normal as well um once if someone doesn 't want help that 's because they you know they 're obviously going through issues but they don 't want it to be confronted they don 't want it to be brought up because it is very painful or very stressful and they might just want an escape so continue to be their friend continue to do the things you were going to do that just kind of helps them helps them deal with everything as well um and it 's also important to kind of understand that they might be reacting a bit differently to stuff and give them that patience and give them that time that you know if your friend yells at you over something small when normally you might kind of get angry at it kind of accept that you know they are going through something and give them that time give them that patience where you might not normally kind of do so um give them that yeah that extra bit of tolerance um compared to normal um and one final thing i 'd actually add as well is that you know even if someone doesn 't want help or whatever you 've got to look after yourself too because what we can can find is that when someone doesn 't want to go get help we take it upon ourselves to kind of be that person for them to be constantly looking after them and it 's a lot of pressure to put on yourself so make sure you 're looked after and make sure you don 't take on their responsibility like the responsibility single-handedly of being that person because then you find any kind of change in them or any difficulty with them it affects you and it 's it 's a lot it is really a lot and obviously we want to be there for our friends but um you know remember to support yourself remember to have your own self-care make sure you 're checking in with other people and you 've kind of got that support network for them rather than just yeah being that person yourself yeah yeah 100 like been through that and stuff yeah absolutely and it is hard though because i mean you want to be that supportive person um but but it does affect us more than we think more than we realize sometimes yeah um so now miley 's got a little bit of a hypothetical scenario for you so i 'll pass it over to her so miley you 're up okay um so this is a scenario um so i 'm going through my hsc _''_1262.159 who 's very close to me and i 've been noticing that they 're acting extremely stressed and she 's not actually eating and she 's told me that she 's staying up late all night studying and she gets hardly any sleep um and i 've taken i 've noticed that it 's taken a big toll on her um and by that toll i mean she 's having like panic attacks and she 's not being herself um what do you think that i should do to be able to support her yeah that 's a tough one um and it is you know a difficult situation but it 's something that you know very risk realistically we might be faced with because the hsc is so stressful and something that we really take on and we really commit to um and sometimes you know the schools don 't do the best job of reducing that stress i 've noticed sometimes schools yeah it 's it 's not fun um so look and what makes that situation even more difficult is because your friend is under a lot you kind of make things more difficult you know you say to them what you 're doing is not helpful like everything they 're doing there is a response to the stress it 's their way of coping and so if you add to that stress you 're going to make things worse for them because they 're going to kind of have to do it even more because that 's a coping mechanism that um you know staying up late whatever else is going on um so what you want to do i guess the first step there is just ask the question is kind of ask them if they are okay um now again like we said they 're under a lot of stress so we don 't want to do that in a way that 's confrontational at all we don 't want to sound like we 're criticizing them um because when i 'm sure you guys can all imagine when you 're under stress when someone 's kind of going are you okay what 's going on you build you block up yeah yeah that in that situation is kind of make it not about them but make it about the situation and say something like you know i 've noticed you 've had a couple of panic attacks are things okay um because then what you 're doing there is you 're not just going straight at them you 're actually putting it about the panic attacks or about the situation kind of being like oh that 's a bit of a worrying thing that 's going on um how are you dealing with that sort of thing um so then yeah they might not take it as as personally so kind of say yeah you i 've noticed some you know you 're having some kind of taxes everything going okay and then if they kind of tell you look i 'm struggling the stress and everything have a conversation about that be their friend be supportive just remember you 're not a mental health professional you don 't have to fix their problems but listen to them give them a space to kind of talk about things and then ask them say do you think we can kind of do to help you um manage this what do you think 's more helpful for you actually ask them involve them in because if you tell them if you said to them you need to do differently you need to get more sleep you need to stop studying so much you need to stop stressing it 's not going to help telling them what to do is never going to kind of say anything whereas if you can say to them look you 're struggling what do you think you might be able to do differently um or is there anything we can do differently then they might say or they might be open to kind of going uh what i 'm doing isn 't working maybe i do need to get more sleep maybe i do need to kind of have some self-care maybe i do need to look after myself so in terms of supporting them directly i guess the most important thing is asking the question having a conversation normalizing it you know they 're going through a very stressful don 't make it sound like you 're criticizing them just let give them the space to talk give them the space to kind of collaborate with you to come up with the kind of solution um whereas on the other hand if they say no i 'm fine no everything 's good everything 's going great that 's a tough situation there that 's when it gets kind of tricky that 's when you might need to say to them hey listen your marks are going to suffer at the moment and actually make it not about them but about the effect that their behavior is having that that what they 're worrying about is their marks that 's the thing they 're stressing about um and so you can actually say look what you 're doing there is actually going to bring your marks down if you 're not sleeping you 're not going to remember anything if you 're having you know too much anxiety too much stress your brain is just not going to be in a position to kind of remember the information and your to do it but once it gets to that point it 's hard because if they don 't want help and they 're absolutely shut off from help there is not much you can do directly with them um however there 's also things you can do i guess indirectly um so for instance you could go to your teachers and say hey listen you don 't even have to name you could say i 've noticed some people are really struggling i 've been you know some people having panic attacks the stress is really getting high can we do something about that and your teachers can kind of um potentially get everyone down and give them a bit of a talk and say about self-care and kind of techniques to reduce stress or what they can do there um because then that way it 's not at your friend it 's not directed at one person it 's just a general sort of um information um it 's just general sort of for everyone um as well you could organize for you know group study sessions or so that kind of stuff to make sure they 've got the support you know groups study things can kind of be more relaxed and you can kind of use those to kind of initiate a conversation um or things like that so well trying to kind of support them directly might be tough in that regard i 'd say have a conversation um you know make it not about them but make it about their situation and just normalize it say you know this is stressful i 'm stressed as well this is really tough um how are you coping with it um and then see if they respond to that see if they have anything any suggestions for themselves see if they can kind of help out but if that doesn 't work then look for indirect ways look for other ways you can support them outside of that whether it 's going to teachers and organizing something like that through the friends even their family if you want to if that 's appropriate but people might not respond as well to that um yeah does that kind of feel like it would be a lot easier to like you know if they 're not going to accept you know the mental health um like going to a clinician or a practitioner or something like that i feel like it 'd be a lot easier to you know tell teacher at the school maybe if i have a year coordinator or something like that and be able to do like kind of group thing where it 's about well-being and do some good like activities fun ice breakers and kind of break the room and make everyone feel a little bit better but yeah thank you so much i really did understand that that 's good okay all right so we 're reaching the end of our sort of interview um we 've got one final question and so kind of lighten up the mood tell us your favorite joke oh i mean that 's the hardest question you asked me um all right save your day okay here we go i 'm i 'm a fan of dad jokes so bear with me um okay there

    "text": "[Music] hello my name is Helen and thank you for tuning in to learn more about wound farming because reducing food waste and preventing it from going to landfill are some of the most important actions we can take to reduce our impact on the environment worm farms are a great way to recycle food scraps especially for those living in units and town houses where there 's no access to garden material it also provides us with free fertilizer which is fabulous wound juice and castings and they are a great way to help kids understand how nature recycles trust me worms are amazing creatures [Music] now I 'm going to show you how to set up your wind farm and I 'm going to be using this great little compact wind farm for demonstration now you 'll notice there are various levels when you 're when you 're of key to rise but we 're only gonna start with the base level where the liquid drains with the tap and the bucket underneath and that 's how we harvest the one way and the lid the legs and great material a great bedding material which we 're going to put your worms into in a moment I 'll show you that in a moment you 're also going to need a sheet of moistened cardboard some moistened passion or natural cloth of some sort and of course you 're going to need your worms now I have extracted these worms from my worm fun but you 'll be purchasing your worms from a nursery they come in starter packs of around a thousand for fifty dollars ok so now we 're going to prepare our worm fun to add our worms to the worm phone we 're going to start by placing a sheet of cardboard to prevent the worms and the new bedding material from falling straight through to the base so this is just a piece of cardboard that 's been more sent now on top of that we 're going to add the bedding material so the bedding material is this Coco fiber which comes with your kit and when you put it in a bucket of water it expands and becomes this beautiful crumbly from so we 're gonna tip the bedding material into the worm farm ideally the bedding materials roughly around 10 centimeters thick they 're roughly spread that out a bit and I 'm going to show you what it looks like and then we 're going to add our once now these worms are from my worm farm now these worms are special worms these are not common garden worms these are compost worms that you have to buy from the nursery they are suited to the intense nutrient-rich environment of a worm farm and they can eat their body weight in food each day so they are quite special you your common earthworm will not survive in a worm farm so you might notice how shiny they are you may be able to tell and that just means how how dependent they are on moisture so it 's really important to keep your worm from waste and they 're very sensitive to light as well so they don 't they always burrow away so it 's important not to handle the worms for too long so we 're going home little wormies spread them out I 'm gonna cover them with a blanket the all-important blanket to keep them dark and moist now normally we wouldn 't place any food scraps for a few days to let them settle in so just pop the lid on and leave them for a few days before you start adding food scraps very slowly a handful at a time because the worm population of 1000 really needs to build up before they can get through a container worth of food scraps here is some food that you would typically add to your worm farm now fruit scraps Williams particularly loves soft fruit like melon and banana skins vegetable scraps the smaller you chop that the better part from the juicer if you have it worms love avocado skins and even the sea they will eventually curl up into the seed coffee grounds and tea leaves crushed eggshells and paper towels and shredded newspaper is also great just moisten that before you add it now here are some things not to put into your work thumb that could be harmful for example citrus that out same goes for spicy food like onion chili and garlic now our worms won 't eat potato skins meat and dairy products are a problem because they attract vermin leave your bread out but in terms of cooked rice and pasta you could put small quantities of these but you do have to be careful because those also attract vermin [Music] now that the worms are in their new home it 's important to place the farm in a shady spot outside or inside in the laundry on a balcony and start adding small handfuls of huge around twice a week if you add too much food and the worms don 't eat it within a few days it will go mouldy and worms will not eat moldy food but it will make it smelly and attract cockroaches so it 's best to remove any rotting scraps on average a healthy worm farm which started out with 1,000 worms could build up to 10,000 worms within a year by this time they should be getting through a kitchen caddy of scraps like this each week now watering is about once a week or once every two weeks the water will trickle through the system and out the tap and into a bucket make sure that the tap is always open so you don 't flood the worms this is also how you harvest your worm juice you may be able to see it 's quite concentrated and it needs to be diluted one to four parts water before using it it should look like quick tea this is really a wonderful tonic for your plants [Music] now I hear you ask when do I add the new level well when this level is full of worms and castings you will remove your blanket and you 'll add your new level we just got the holes in the bottom it needs to sit nice and snug on top of the lower level there should be no gaps between the two levels so the worms can easily travel between the two levels you then add your scraps to this level and cover it once again with the all-important worm blank kept nice and moist pop the lid back on top [Music] _"

    "text": "hello my name is Helen thank you for tuning in to learn more about composting because composting and reducing food waste are some of the most important actions you can take to reduce your impact on the environment there are many ways to compost from large bin Bay 's Bokashi bins to worm towers in your veggie patch but for this video we 'll be referring to this type of compost bin typically that you will buy from your local nursery now this kind of compost bin is ideally placed out in your garden in a sunny spot and it relies on a large proportion of garden organics so if you 're looking for a way to compost your food scraps alone then when farming is the better option for you did you know that on average our waste bins are half-full of food waste alone and that means in the city of Canada Bay we are sending 8,500 tons of food waste to landfill each year and that also means that families are wasting around 1000 per annum so before we even start thinking about composting it 's really of the issues that people have with composting are you one of those people who have tried and ended up with a smelly rotting mess attracting rodents or on the other hand perhaps a dry heave where nothing is breaking down well these are typical problems but it 's not the way that composting is meant to be and these problems are easy to rectify and I 'm gonna give you some simple guidelines to help avoid those problems [Music] okay so we 're going to talk about the atom principles the atom principles are the key factors for successful composting and the a starts for o stands for aliveness d stands for diversity a stands for aeration and M stands for moisture let 's start with the a or the aliveness and this refers to the fact that our compost bins rely on a team of living organisms breaking down our material and it 's our job to provide the right elements for them when we provide the right conditions that decomposes tuna to produce beautiful sweet-smelling compost a healthy compost is full of worms microbes bacteria and fungi your compost bin as a living ecosystem that we are looking after to do our job for us now the day is for diversity so we need to add a variety of ingredients to our compost bin [Music] going to start with the carbon materials here the brown materials are which you need approximately 60% or more now we 'll start with the brown leaves now leaves are gold for your compost bin if you don 't have them at home I recommend that you break them up in the street or in the park and add them to your compost we know there really are marvelous and the other thing that you will probably have easy access to is paper and cardboard just moisten it and shred it or tear it as much as you can because the smaller the pieces the quicker it will break down and we have some garden prunings which you 'll probably have access to quite easily and sticks mistakes are great but they do take a long time to break down so if you have a lawn mower that you could run over and some sawdust now most people don 't have access to sawdust but I like to add it here untreated sawdust is fabulous if you can get your hands on it just make sure it 's chemical free now we 've got the green nitrogen materials over here on this I will start with the kitchen scraps our peelings eggshells tea bags and coffee grounds add them to your compost bin as well as your flowers your cut flowers that you might have in a vase or or out in the garden as well as your lawn clippings and weights we get questions any questions about weeds now weeds are a great source of nitrogen for your compost bin just make sure that you cut off any seed heads because those these heads will survive in that compost bin and then sprout when you spread it out into your garden so weeds great not the seeds the next a is for aeration compost creatures require oxygen so aerate your compost regularly with a spiral mixing tool like this this is a really handy tool for your compost bin we 'll a pitchfork as well now the M is for moisture your compost creatures need water so keep your compost moist at all times like a damp sponge is a good rule of thumb in the hot summer months this may mean a watering can each week and when adding dry materials such as paper and cardboard it 's always best to moisten it before you add it unless your compost heap is very wet already if it 's very wet then adding dry newspaper is very helpful to absorb all that moisture [Music] [Music] _"

is sacred and all living things have a place in the web of life we respect our elders past and present and our youth as young leaders who guide us on the journey of healing through belonging hello i 'm sarah a park ranger at sydney olympic park thank you for joining me today to explore the coastal salt marsh environment within the parklands and to explore what makes salt marsh an important habitat for migratory showbits let 's go and meet jenny amira our parkland ecologist [Music] coastal salt marsh is a community of about 200 plant species so a community is a unit of fauna and flora all living together in a defined space and behind me we 've got a beautiful example of the zonation of coastal salt marsh so in the upper reaches so in the higher part of the topography we have the terrestrial plants such as the casuarina and above the down we 've got a lighter green band around the outside of the salt marsh area and that 's the upper levels of the coastal salt marsh so there you find plants like suede and the taller shrubs and then as you come a little bit further down the slope colored sort of an olive you 've got the beaded glass wart which is on the lower sections and then below the beaded glass wart as you go downslope we then go into the mud flats coastal salt marsh is quite responsive to tidal wash and as the tides come in and out the lower areas are quite often inundated for coastal salt marsh and those areas are where you find the beaded glass wart and then as you go up slope you have less and less flushing by the tide it 's a bit drier maybe a little less salty and that 's where you start getting your suede so the topography influences how much the salt marsh is inundated and that then dictates where the plants are distributed within the space if we look at the bitter wood are three different colors three different parts the first one is brown so the brand bits is for support the next color is red and this is where the plant stores salt and the last bit is green that 's where the plant photosynthesizes and you can see here that 's what 's happening so brown red and green [Music] so what are the best conditions for salt marsh to grow it needs simple growing medium and that is in a coastal area a bit of salinity in the sediment and it 's not a water logged area or it is not a too high ground see this open pocket where salt marsh has not colonized and in this area we have salt marsh growing now because the condition of the ground here is not conducive for salt plants to grow for example we have some rubbles and through these rubbles salt marsh cannot grow so that 's why unless there is a bit of a sediment built up salt marsh will not colonize now salt marsh actually can naturally colonize for example we see some very tiny tiny baby babies so they have germinated by themselves and the seeds from here go into the essuri through the tide these seeds spread into the soft marsh beds and then they germinate [Music] kylie would you like to tell us about the coastal so much environments within the canada bay council area sure thank you sarah so today we are at prince edward park which is at cabareta on the parramatta river and as you can see there is some coastal salt mush actually all around us but it wasn 't this great before it was in very poor condition the river has had a lot of heavy industry over the decades and centuries so luckily for me and for the environment our predecessors had the foresight to earmark this as an important site ecologically and with the help of a passionate dedicated group of volunteers we 've managed to get this coastal salt much from poor condition up to about medium condition which is really great so as i mentioned the bush care group has been working at this site for about 15 years and some of the activities that also litter collection being on the river the salt marsh tends to collect a lot of debris and also kind of further up on the slope we 've done plantings to protect people animals and other rubbish from coming down onto the salt marsh so some of the threats as you can see it 's a really low growing fragile succulent species there 's about five of them five different plant species that form the basic community of coastal salt marsh and if you were to walk on this it would take some time for it to recover dinghies being dragged along rubbish dogs off leash people changes in the hydrology so changes in the river all of those things can have a negative impact on the salt marsh [Music] we are here at rotpoint at a section of the bay run and there are many different recreational activities happening here such as people running walking their dogs and sailing so kylie how does the council find a balance between a lot of visitors coming through and as well protecting the coastal silk marsh yeah so as we know coastal that there 's not much of it and what 's there we need to protect so just behind us you can see that there 's a fence so the fence is there for a variety of reasons it 's to stop traffic cyclists people just coming directly down onto the salt marsh and also just behind us there 's a sign and that 's a very basic overview about what coastal salt marsh is we 've also just on the other side of the bay we 've undertaken a re-vegetation project so with a special license we had a nursery come and collect some pre-existing material and then they grew that on and when that had roots took about six months they went and planted it out in a section and that 's been going really well we know that there 's about 10 different locations of coastal salt marsh in the area they range from poor to medium condition it 's about two hectares in total we do what we can to look after it we 've got a few bush care groups that work at the sites we hectares it 's not much but it 's small and significant [Music] what impact does litter have on coastal salt marsh you can see that we are surrounded by litter this is all coming from the upper catchment and plastics and many other forms of litter with heavy rainfalls and also with high tides either in isolation or in combination all these flow from upper catchment which is on my left and then the lower attachment is on my right this has got many impacts on the coastal sword marsh one is the physical presence itself so that the organic stuff cannot grow the second is the plastic itself leeches and it it contributes to the micro plastic into our waterways into the sea and the ocean and also lots of these actually don 't degrade for decades after decades we 're here at shadrach shore reserve which is a beautiful reserve which is surrounded by residents from concord and mort lake so kylie what were the conditions here of the coastal salt marsh you can see there 's not much here there 's a few trees some weeds and ago and i noticed that there was some pre-existing salt marsh i spoke to the team that mows down here and along with my managers we decided that we would simply stop mowing so that is a really basic kind of fundamental in restoration so it stopped mowing and when we stopped mowing i erected the coil logs they were like my markers of where the salt marsh was budding up against and then we did something called the three w 's which is weed wait and watch and the results speak for themselves [Music] over the past 20 years sydney olympic park authority has continued to protect enhance and sustain coastal salt marsh environments through active and adaptive management on one hand it remains firm in its conservation values yet on the other it is agile in making adjustments decisions are made from evidence and monitoring outcomes gathered in the fields examples are photographs records and noticeable changes over time they 're based on scientific investigations and outcomes from changes in tidal inundation weed removal pest monitoring rehabilitation mangrove monitoring and visitor impact our priority is to manage these really important habitat for a wide range of flora and fauna and it is an important part of the food web or it provides a lot of food for a lot of fauna there 's crabs and insects and little gribblies that live in the mud that provide food for a huge range of animals and here at sydney olympic park one of our most important animals is the migratory shorebird and this is a bird that travels up to 20 000 kilometers every year it 's only here during summer and behind me we 've got one sharp sailed sandpiper at the moment they travel up through the east asian australasian flyway to siberia and alaska and they breed there during the northern summer there 's a very productive time of year as bush regenerators you 'll be happy to know that we don 't recommend working in salt marsh during summer because that 's when the migratory shorebirds are present within coastal salt marsh so in order to reduce disturbance on this threatened group of birds we recommend that you do not do any bush regeneration during the they are roosting in the salt marsh so around the edges of the mud flat in the water depending on what tide levels there are then that 's when those birds are present and to reduce disturbance we avoid doing any work in summer so kylie what are the environmental benefits of protecting coastal salt marsh yeah something that 's really interesting is that it is a carbon sink so carbon sequestrian it 's up there with forests that 's a very important factor also it 's great habitat so for crustaceans crabs also certain species of fish will lay their eggs in the salt marsh and we 're lucky enough to also have the bar tailed godwit which feeds on the mud flats now that bird flies about 21 000 kilometers and it uses canada bay as a rest stop and to also feed while it 's here so coastal coastal salt marsh is really important in that it grows in a hyper saline which is a really salty situation and that doesn 't grow anywhere else so it 's unique that it supports specific plant communities improving and an important role in providing biodiversity the flora and fauna of salt marshes is incredibly diverse the community provides feeding and breeding habitat for fish birds crustaceans they act as filters for nutrients and sediments they reduce erosion they maintain water quality salt marsh is an important part of the ecosystem in sydney and not only from a legal point of view but from the ecosystem services that they provide there are many ecosystem benefits of coastal salt marsh coastal salt marsh is an essential part of healthy estuaries and salty lagoons they provide an important habitat for birds fish aquatic and land invertebrates and microbats including threatened and protected species there are among the most productive ecosystems on earth providing nursery areas for fish crustaceans and insects they also have the highest ability to store carbon long-term in the ground called a carbon sink carbon sequestering is the removal and storage of carbon from the atmosphere and reversing the effects of global climate change they provide protection from floods reducing erosion trapping sediment and recycling nutrients and pollutants coastal salt marsh environments support a plant community that will not salt marsh so much exists at the bottom of the catchment and we all live up in the top reaches of the catchment so what we do as a community impacts on this community so understanding and educating the people around us about how special coastal salt marsh is and how important it is to the biodiversity of sydney it 's really important the community can help with rubbish collection with weeding programs they can help with the quality of water that comes down the creeks and the rivers which impact on our plant community as a member of the community what can you do to improve and protect coastal salt marsh stay on the pathways whether you 're walking cycling or driving your car keep your dog on a lead ensure your pet is kept under control and out of the salt mush and always pick up your animal 's poo keep polluted storm water out of the salt marsh ensure chemicals such as pesticides herbicides and fertilizers do not escape from your property do not dump rubbish never dump garden clippings or grain waste in these areas ensure wastes in a green bin provided by the council join a bush care group or park care group please report any damage to the environment to the local council for the area or through the environment line [Music] thank you for joining us today to learn about the coastal salt marsh environment if you want to

go any further um and i think we 're all doing the right thing here in five dock in the canada bay area by social distance in which you agree they 're doing a great job and certainly i think that we need to keep uh setting that message out there to stay strong and to make sure that we support our local businesses yes yes the businesses it 's you know provide so much to this area you know the the the materials the foods the jobs um so they 're doing it tough they 're doing tough and we really need to support them today 's a big day for us here and you said 23 years and how how big it 's grown in those 23 years chris remember the back of fred kelly kelly place on the back of a truck back of a truck and now when the top of the building uh near the library so we 've gone along [Music] that 's right i 've got to say to all our italian italian community uh that we are celebrating a big day uh and that is fedor gusto um and last year we we did have them the procession up the road yeah early morning the very first time the very very first one we want to continue to do that and uh hopefully next year will provide us the opportunity to do that uh angelo i i i and everything was a very very big hit in the italian community it brought it brought something uh for for our italian people that they 're used to all those different uh community groups that are here in uh five dock in canada bay from all the different regions in italy yep uh and they got together that morning exactly right and they stayed together and what a big day that was that was i think that was one of our biggest days so we had probably over 110 000 people come through great north road all the way from queens road all the way down to lions road where the great north road is totally blocked off as well as a lot of side streets at and i dare say that i would say ferragosto would be the biggest street fair in sydney if not the biggest well look i 've got to agree with you chris not that i 'm being biased but i certainly agree thank you the biggest italian festival in not only sydney but australia that 's where i 'm going down there i know say that you 're right mr man i think we should take a trip down to melbourne and see what their streets like maybe next year so when things are back to normal and we hope they do come back to normal um but i 've got to say that our community has been resilient yes uh really tough and you know having to change so much uh because of the tough times we 're in yeah and it 's been a tough year all that all around uh so a big shout out to everyone out there that we uh right behind you uh the council is doing what we can to support our community as local businesses as they do and making sure we um stick together and especially the people that are you know are trapped in their houses and homes by themselves and by the way yes there are a lot of people trapped in the homes by themselves and getting very very little assistance in some cases where they have not such a big family or people they can let us know chris because we what service approving please contact the council let them know if you 're lonely and you need any help whatsoever council is

to be here i 'm very well thank you it 's a it 's a pleasure to have you here let me say thank you um tommy can you please start off by telling me just a little bit about yourself and how long you 've been associated with that kawasaki okay well um my family is originally from puglia in italy but i was born here in australia but grew up very very italian so speak in italian speaking dialect i went to uni and i did social work and psychology and ended up working at coaster i started there in 2000 as a social worker um and i went with the philosophy that you know if you stay stick around long enough they 'll eventually promote you so um so so now i 'm the general manager i 've been there um 20 years um yeah and i love what i do it range of services so every day brings a new challenge but but also new exciting opportunities well being there for that long you certainly have uh earned your stripes there haven 't you i 'm well indeed yeah look um can you please tell me uh our audience what exactly is coasit please tell our audience what it is and how it did come to be where it actually originated from and it 's original sure sure so look the organization was established in 1968 so we celebrated our 50th anniversary a couple of years ago we 've been around a long time and we were established uh under the auspices of the italian uh consulate at the time to maintain the italian language and culture in new south wales but as all things do the organization evolved and a couple of years later we started providing on arrival settlement services and supports so migrants were still coming out we were actually at the ports providing welcome hampers providing access to employment second-hand furniture and supporting the community to settle roughly what year early 70s 70s so 68 we started work uh organizing social gathering so that the community could uh could stay together could be together was there a big influx of migrants that were coming out and how are they actually coming out yeah look the peak was for the italian community was early seventies uh so post war to to the early 1970s they were all um by ship uh so they made that very long arduous journey many cases families were separated so you know dad would come out first establish himself and then call out for his wife and uh and children who would join him in some cases years later and so those early days was about getting kids in school getting employment gaining employment um and finding opportunities to settle so kawasa played a role in that but at the same time we were teaching italian yeah so the italian government was really interested in um in maintaining the italian language for the children of the migrants which i have to say um had some foresight to it you know i mean it 's largely i believe why italian is so well taught culture uh here in new south wales and in australia more broadly so the young ones the the young immigrants as well they were they were being taught uh english at an early age as well through this this association well they would have been taught english through the ordinary schooling system and we were taking um we 're looking after the their cultural needs and their italian language needs so they 're doing that alongside um but the organization continued to evolve you know and now you know 50 well 52 years later we have two two very main divisions one around community services so that 's settlement support that really evolved into aged care welfare counselling and our language side where we teach italian to about seven thousand kids throughout the state we have our own primary school uh the first italian bilingual school in the country and the only one in new south wales where we deliver the new health wales curriculum but in both english and italian so it certainly was a much needed association for for these newly arrivals which is very very important for a new a new country very strange to them but are you able to tell us what services are provided for the community uh through uh coasit yeah look there 's quite a raft of services so in our community services our largest program is what we call home care packages so we 're delivering packages of assistance to older people to enable them to remain independent and living at home and living in the community and we do this by matching them with a community care worker who will provide personal care or transport services cleaning services shopping services in the home in the community to avoid premature entering to residential care okay we have a raft of counselling programs in mental health drug and alcohol gambling youth and family we have a very substantial volunteer network where we match volunteers with people living in the community or in residential settings we have what 's called a um a social support group program so we have 19 groups throughout sydney where we transport older people from their homes to a community center and provide meals and activities for them our language services division is where we 're teaching italian so we 're teaching italian in the school system as i said to some seven thousand students we 're teaching italian after school to 500 students and we are teaching italian to adults over three sites although at the moment mostly online but over three sites to some 600 adults learn who learn italian with us and then some other smaller programs here and there but in a nutshell that 's our that 's our main service offering so thomas told me uh what is casa is our building and it 's situated on norton street it 's our head office we do have other properties at our school and our cultural center in on northern street and a small office in the cbd but kazu italia is the symbolic home of kawasaki and i suppose to some extent the symbolic home of the community it was a um a gathering place so you know quite literally means home for italians right yeah um and and that 's what we try and live up to you know it 's a matter if they 're newly arrived or been here for a very long time it 's a place where anytime you can come feel comfortable and get the assistance that they need back in the day though it was a social it had a social element to it because italia was a medium place a gathering place which then evolved into more assistance and more welfare as it is today it sort of takes me back uh as a meeting place for a lot of the italians that came out from various parts of the country the arpia club that was that was like a a big big family indeed gather i everybody met there and everybody celebrated their birthdays their parties their their marriages were born out of that yeah and of course the new arrivals that came out it was always the up year club yes indeed and uh that sort of grew from there i think it was a very big disappointment when the rp club sort of dispersed it hurt a lot of people yeah um look i hear there 's uh a coaster medal i it 's it 's awarded each year uh the co-asset medal and can you tell us a little bit about the initiative throughout the year of how that sort of comes about sure so the kaiser medal was inaugurated about 20 years ago right and it was done to acknowledge outstanding contribution so not ordinary but something really um really above and beyond um violent voluntary to the community to the italian community and the community nominates so we we just advertise it very widely and the board makes a final selection and it 's quite a prestigious honor prestigious award um and you know it can be people from all different walks of life uh people who have contributed been on a committee um fun fundraised and not just for coastal social work absolutely volunteer work absolutely yeah so we 've had some outs and people who are often not very well known but uh uh are plotting away in the background doing doing really great community work was mama lena and a recipient i remember mamalina many many years ago she is like the mother teresa or flores foundation gave us a very uh generous grant to build a um a multimedia center at our school yeah so we have a very strong partnership with the mama lena foundation and with her daughter rosalbo is just an absolutely wonderful person so mama lena yes of course an absolute icon oh community never she 'll ever be forgotten no no nor should she now for our audiences out there and our audiences as as i said uh who they may be interested uh in what they how they can get involved with with coaster but how would they go about it if they see cow as it say i love this i want to i want to be involved i want to help people yeah absolutely um we weren 't uh we we wouldn 't turn anybody away you had some time uh to give to us um they can do so by emailing us at info coaster.org dot a u or call our office on 9564074 and you can repeat that number for me sure nine five six four zero seven double four and just let us know and there are different ways to get involved you can help us out in the office you can visit somebody in a nursing home or in their own home you can join one of our committees there are numerous ways that people can get involved if people are needing assistance please don 't be shy give us a call it might you might not need it now but it might be something that you 're thinking of needing in the future particularly around the aged care community care needs if you if you need some counselling support then we we can offer that and we can offer that remotely at the moment if people are concerned about coming out but by all means we 're there for the community i find that people only understand uh coaster in terms of whatever experience they 've had with us so if they 've learned italian with us they think we teach italian if they 've received a community service from us they think that we 're a counselling service where all of those things are much more so give us a call operating and we 'd love to engage with people in the community and we want the community to know what it is we do and how they can get involved thomas camporili thank you very much for coming along to ferragosto we hope you enjoy the rest of the day if you 're staying around for a little while but once again thank you very much for your time and that valuable valuable information that you 've you 've given us today my absolute pressure thanks very much

hot so that 's what we do and then what we do also we want to chop some tomatoes you already chopped the tomatoes right so i 've chopped some tomatoes just already for you magical tv we 've got the garlic here and we 've got the chopped tomatoes see and cook them together so as we cook the pasta in here have a look as we cook the pasta will stir so they don 't get stuck to the bottom of the pot as we cook the pasta which we have about seven minutes left about seven minutes left we have time to make the sauce look how fast it 's cooking look at the smell the garlic royal flavor that is best huh my it 's insatiable garlic is good for you cherry tomatoes oh look at that it 's just a couple of minutes we just made about one minute then what we have over here is bronze we have beautiful prawns from new south wales they already been cleaned and they are raw raw prawns which we are going to put them inside soon once the garlic brown becomes golden brown here we have botarga so bostag is a special ingredient from sardinia exactly like the parmesan of the ocean yeah so italians don 't really like to put parmesan on the seafood dishes okay so we actually we have to use bota which is basically made with fish eggs yeah fish fruit yeah a little bit of parsley and some lemon and this is an ingredient that rob introduced me today acqua di cheddar [Music] it 's instead of usually from using a white wine to format the dish we 're going to use a bit of alcohol all right so what we do now we 're going to add the prawns because i we got the juice from the tomatoes we 're going to add the prawns add the prawns and it takes about two minutes rub even less cook these prawns at this point i 'm gonna add this yeah yes a generous amount generous amount so this is gonna give the flavor the wine flavor but better rubber okay so you got enough rope yeah a little bit more why not it 's better glass after all isn 't it it 's making me drunk already i love it a little bit of parsley a

    "text": "hi my name is Jason and I 'm an artist and I 've been asked to help you guys make a yes mask or helmet that 's based on the lesson you just had so I believe you guys would have learnt about the blue banded B we 're going to try and make the mask or the helmet based on the blue band and be with most of the things that we would have at home hopefully you guys have a lot of these things at home but I 've made it so that if you don 't have the things you can still make this project without every single material that I 've listed so hopefully you guys had a fun time with this lesson with the blue banner B I think yeah let 's get right to it you 're gonna see my face right now but then I 'm gonna stand up properly and then mostly you 're just gonna see my hands the most important part you know the making what exactly is happening with what I 'm doing I 'm gonna run you guys some materials that you might find at home and what you can substitute that for and then well I think we 're just gonna get right to it so we have some things that will make your life a lot easier or some things that are quite necessary to what we 're gonna be making so you need a hat with a brim it doesn 't have to be a hat that you want to tuck away I 'm gonna show you some ways to use the hat in a way that you can use it again if you want or some ways that you can use the Hat so that it becomes a permanent mass of paper plates if you don 't have a paper plate there 's a way around this and I 'll show you later we definitely would need some sort of cardboard box like a tissue box is really helpful again if you don 't have the spare one handy that 's okay a lot of these things I know you guys probably all recycle really well so you might not have them handy right your tissues I 'm an egg carton so I 'm sort of plastic you can see a lot of these things I 'm using the or things you find around your home that there 's a weet-bix sort of wrapper that 's from the inside of a weet-bix box so you can use a weet-bix box as well if you have some stiffer plastic like this paper holder i 'm sleeve we could use that as well some sort of brown paper bag this softer paper bag is you sort of extra bits of cardboard I think I 've got a toilet roll in here somewhere some shiny so often you can find this if you don 't have anything shiny you can use aluminium foil but we 're gonna try and recycle as much as you know things around our house as possible so the other side of chip package pops up this is lovely Japanese chips I like to eat any chip packet will have a shiny interior so make sure you wash all these things out there you use a result some of the crafts things we staplers textures blue because we 're making the blue vanity scissors some things that make your life easier will be some extra strong tape I 've got some duct tape here hot glue gun I know a lot of you won 't have a hot glue gun at home if you have a sewing kit that 's also really helpful again I 'm not I 'm not sure if you guys will want to know permanently have this helmet on the hat or not so some of these processes some of the things we 're going to be doing make mean you can 't wear the hat as a hat but you can wear it as a so let 's get right to it so the first thing we 're gonna do is we 're going to turn this box inside out so that 's very simple this is where my face sort of disappears so we just take the box apart at the seams cool there should be a seam here we go and then what we 're going to do is just tape it back up so it you can just use yeah we don 't really have to tape up this end because we 're gonna make some cuts and so we 're going to cut from here down there and down there I 'll just do a quick cut so it 's sometimes helpful just to cut off these two ends so you see we 've left these flaps Nathan 's gonna make a shape that looks like that on both sides and on this side it 's helpful to cut through got this what we 're gonna do is close this spit up like that make it nice and round and then we 're gonna leave a tiny bit of a gap there so we can bend that down I 'm using this lap tape if you wanna make it look a little bit better all right are we using this clear tape or if you have any blue tape obviously that be a lot so why we 've left those tucked in is we just want to top this one in here and we 're gonna leave this end out just for now so be I believe you guys learnt about the body of the B so the plates is going to be the head and then we have the thorax where the legs and the wings are and then the abdomen yeah okay so we 're gonna try and touch these two together right now they 're gonna cut two little holes in the hat so that we can still use them so this is the part where I was talking about if you want to keep you happy then you can do two little cuts here if you don 't need to keep your hat in particular what you can do is sew just together like that or you could just simply use the hot glue gun I 've made a little way where we can put a bit of string through here where means the back of the they can move around like a like a normal baby we 're gonna cut little nitpick so there 's a little hole that we can put a bit a stranger Sam 's best sides set it 's a little hole through both dice little bang for string like this be very helpful to have right now what we 're going to do is put a little hole here and a little hole here okay do this with our scissors just be careful don 't poke yourself while you 're doing with this it 's a little hole for a stranger now remember I said if you don 't have a tissue box handy you could sort of make this out of the few bits of cardboard so I 've got some extra cardboard here like a cereal box or Olympics box I 've already used my weak sticks box for another okay so we 've run the strange for those two holes and then like that we 're gonna tie the strings into the holes over there with that string so the first one we can sort of just tie a knot again if you have a hot glue gun it 's much easier just sort of glue the box the Hat but so once that 's tired nicely types on the inside of the cap you have to have placed firmly on then tie the oven not here nice and tight you probably have a little bit of extra string so this one a little triple knot each of those and do whatever there we go so the next thing we 're gonna touch is the head of the beat so we 're gonna attach it like that if you don 't have a paper plate any other plastic plate and either trying to not use so much plastic to show your way [Applause] you can see I 've just cut a hole in this paper very accurate you can just make some slits here [Music] okay completely round but we can mold it and when you guys now there 's a lot of my art making actually prefer she prefer when a lot of what I do isn 't hidden so that you can I we have actually flipped the tissue box around and I wouldn 't have covered this hat which we 'll be doing in a second why I wouldn 't have covered distracted with the brown paper which is more the color of the day but I want want to do because if we do this and we do cover this then it gives us an opportunity to decorate it how we want as well so if you have any other colored textures of paints gonna use or maybe some glitter glue or some cellophane feel free to add this to your muss I think it 's important that we you know have some resemblance to what we just learnt about the blue band be but also we 're doing a creative artistic project so if you wanted to make the that 'd be have some red or yellow I think that 's fine or you know some green or some sparkly colors that 's fine so the next thing we 're going to do get some this brown paper bag right now we do have the head just thorax and the abdomen so you might notice from what you learned today that these up and look like they 're quite furry they 've got these bristles on them so so a brown paper bag so I 'm gonna tuck it tuck it in there and then again a lot easier using this if you wanted to to look much more consistent in color like a real B I might be able to cover this paper play up with this we do have to do because we 've already had the structure of the plate is to cover it and instead I 'm going to leave it kind of like that it 's a bit of a different color from the thorax we can sort of neat it a bit smooth it out a bit smooth out the creases but we can also do that that 's pretty good next thing we 're gonna do is we 're going to use this egg carton to make some legs I like the egg carton because it 's got that texture these have you know sort of very texture that we talked about the bristles that they have on them if you don 't again if you don 't have an egg carton handy just you can use some cardboard this is two bits of the cardboard that we took off the tissue box you could just put those together this looks a lot first thing we do is just cut we 're gonna cut off this bit as well and then we 're going to divide these into four so we 're gonna have one two three that 's one then that 's two legs that 's three legs that 's four legs Abby has six legs so they have their forelegs their middle legs and their hind legs we 're gonna make the front legs the four legs out of something so these are just the middle legs on the hind legs take off these pointy bits and you can do this with you as you can see you can do this with your hands if you want to make it a bit neater and I feel like when you tear a bit with your hands that 's Mexican of very much like Abby 's leg so I 've got one of our legs here so I 'm gonna stab you more show you guys be careful when you 're doing this stuff towards your fingers again we 're gonna use the stapler so we 're gonna attach we 're gonna any attached so in the middle and the back this is where these little bits at the end if you don 't have enough to attach it you can just break it off carefully and notice why I 've put this paper down first is this is a little sticker so you know how staplers might not be able to get through but they can get through the paper and the carton rather than the carton and these extra bits here so this could be the foreleg this will look better if I attach that to that let 's sing we 're gonna be doing these making the wings it 's up to you what you think is gonna look better you can use the sleeve or if you just have some plastic I 'm gonna use a plastic bag so wings has two wings they have their wings and their hind wings just gonna cut out of shape just cut these out and then I 'll show you guys what the I cut out two shapes that look like that and I 'm pretty happy to glue like a blue bounded yes again this is why we 've used the paper how do you place it as well make sure you before you staple it you 're placing that so that there 's the four wing at the front and then the high in the back also for everyone looking at watching at home I 'm just doing this one side so for the face this is why we have the chip wrapper so we 're gonna open yeah that 's a nice and shiny I 'm gonna make some be eyes be always pretty round but again I don 't want to stop you guys imagining what a bi look like the bi shape is roughly like that and it 's not exactly like that bit more rounded I kind of like this shape so I 'm gonna stick with this so again we 're gonna everything is using the specular today make sure you watch these rappers out cuz they have a bit of a chip smelter as well unless you like that of course and then we 've got lots of cardboard left up you can just bend them like that and then they 'll stick up please please we staple them down again the this is where these little bits are notice how we 're sort of recycling everything these can be the mandibles order let 's not forget the stinger so you can choose how big or small like this thing up what we can do is we can use one of the egg cartons sort of mandible bits that I 'm just gonna show you if you don 't want to use that or

the next 20 years well i was born in like i was born in marion street and debs pleasures in marion street right behind the little lane behind them was mulry street which is where mumbra and mum and dad didn 't know each other until her about 28 years old they had no it they looked across a bloody laneway for chrissake and the only reason that they met was mum had two sisters and dad 's dog had got out in the back line and bit one of the sisters so dead comes over to apologize and years later on board so they yeah I don 't know what happened in the middle so obviously something first moving into Chizik there were probably only half a dozen roads we were mainly all boys that played together in a little Street gang we all went to join public high school great place to grow up because we had a public bars up the road that was built when I was there it was just a title bars and that was sort of like a central place where everyone hung out right next door there where we have bought feel drive at the moment where all the big units have been built I went to school with jet board filled his grandfather was an alderman on the council in those days and that 's why I bought field drives name originated it used to be what they call the Box Company the box company was just an area that simply made boxes normally 3-ply 5-ply seven-play timber boxes and this kids the idea was to sneak along the waterfront into there and then hide from the people who are in there trying to kick you out and the workers who were in there okay the box company itself was a great places little kids to play in there were large amounts of timber timber panelling timber beams and they 're all covered by large big green tarpaulins now you we didn 't have computers naturally things like that so it was outside you would come back of course when the street lights came on we only had probably half a dozen streetlights in the whole place so it didn 't matter and we were just all you know you 're just one of the streets playing together disappear it sort of eight o 'clock in the morning go to someone 's place for lunch where you get half a dozen kids turn up you 'd have peanut butter sandwiches and some sort of soft drink or water and then you go out just do the afternoon stuff down what they call present today before it was tuck present we had a bamboo patch and the bamboo patch was great because you could just get lost was probably the size of two house blocks but as little kids it was huge and you could get in there and just play and run and have fun we always had the waterfront it was always based around water as kids we had little canoes nothing like they 've got these days just the Harbour Bridge we paddle under the gladesville bridge I was there in the days where the gladesville bridge was built I could look out of my window watch the bridge being constructed as we were growing up and the thing was that there were no problems in those days about going out just having fun growing up as a little guy you didn 't need a lot to do things with you 've got everywhere on a bike and you got everywhere by walking and that was it right next door to us was a great guy the quill family qu I develop two boys Steve and Ronnie and the parents who were Eddie and Betty Eddie or Ted he was no teddy was the head of the Sydney vice squad for a number of years in the 1960s we 're basically things were settled a bit differently in the world teddy was also tied up with the famous 21 division headed up by bumper Farrell but as far as a neighbor goes every probably every every Christmas at least but at least once a month he just put room and everyone what the neighbors are Jessica there was a good thing about like the neighbors just turn up and the beers it but you taking a bottle beer or something and there 'd be just food and drinks and want to get together was really cool probably hindsight my friend Harry Harry hindsight wonderful person and how do you said Ross hang on to your place whatever you do don 't start but the thing was you know situations at those at that time dictated it so therefore Ross by a block a land down there in that history to the bottom of the area which is all swamp it 's absolutely crap you know it 's part of the tip by that because there were places build on that today they 're obviously worth a couple maybe it does and we could have picked it up for a son and I tell you and when when my parents first moved into Heslin street we 're only a poor family I think it cost to build our home 1,750 pounds is what mom borrowed or dad borrowed and was offered the whole of that side of his lips street for 5,000 pounds now in those days five thousand pounds of it holy he 's got one I mean we had a 300-pound deposit for god sake to put down and five thousand pounds would have bought you from the bottom of heslin Street up to where the Matheson 's were living there are at the moment they 're 16 12 14 15 dwellings i would say each of those dwellings would be in the vicinity of average 2 million so there 's 30 million for five thousand dollar a play in 55 years that wouldn 't be a bad super retirement package will that 's a bit but Harry hindsight is a wonderful teacher with this so so there yet Chizik is a lovely place to drop I love Chizik chizi was part of my childhood I adore Chizik Chizik for me was just a wonderful place not Cheers WIC check that what will you is silent like a woman get your wuble-u out of the woman language Chizik thanks guys you _"

and the it is unbelievable the last month six weeks where we 've had these beautiful days the sunsets are just amazing and one night it was so spectacular that I wasn 't the only one down there people would really met their you know cameras to come down and capture it and then of course yeah it 's beautiful because it does wind like a snake and then all of a sudden you hear that the river kept coming slowly wending its way through the curves it 's just that 's an extraordinary that 's an extraordinary moment actually my name is think I 'm mad but they either community in Chizik i think is fairly representative in terms of what 's happening with community everywhere in that there is sadly less connection these days between people in communities I their blocks of units within my own block there was people there who hadn 't lived there since it was built originally they 've moved on now so they were well established in the body corporate and I participated in the body culprit because it 's a good way to be part of that community over the years the nature of the residence has changed at one time the majority of people were renters but now it 's in Reverse a lot of younger people have come in and bought this is their first home not as an investment property which is great so that 's that 's added a new dimension to life there and it 's great to that they also participate on the body corporate so we 're getting a lot of different ideas and people who are in the know and with great context for any work that needs to be done I think times are changing in a way that we 're becoming more connected with the people from our community in a unit we certainly have a connection with the different people so that got neighbors who you can trust I think the key to it all is if you can find someone you can trust your key with you know you 're in a good place and I 've got my key with several people because I 'm always locking myself out we have some elderly people there you have their health problems it 's interesting we all look out for them I have an elderly man 's key so that if he has a problem he knows that I 'll go down when we 've known people have been ill people rally and they do the shot before them so you know I know if I were sick tomorrow I could go to a couple of people and they would help me they take me to a hospital no worries so that that 's that 's really comforting and another man was very ill so different people look after him they look after different people watch out for honey you know if you don 't see the light on after a few days some little chairman and that has happened which save been wonderful to have some of the old buildings remain I think the building around there started property in the 60s when anything that was old was pretty well demolished wasn 't it which as I said said for for us where we 're actually situated at number seven is built on the old timber mill so as a consequence we have a problem with termites that 's a leftover from days gone by at least is that older building down in that huge new estate further down the road there 's a couple of buildings around but there isn 't much and that is disappointing but I guess that 's that was the time people deserve not things down but we 've still got the old steps there that lead down to whether the Ferry Wharf is I think part of being part of a community and feeling a sense of ownership is about having knowledge of the history and identifying interesting landmarks within your environment particularly for young children are we doing anything in the school at Abbott 's that to tell them about the history of the home to their families many of who of course live in our units in that area interesting history many years ago when we had the father and son working at the fish shop by chance one day who should stop there to buy fish and chips but Allan Jones and because Allan loved it so much he then talked about it on the radio and that was just the most amazing opportunity and advertisement for the people at the Chyzyk fish shop and in fact you would often see a little mini bus full of seniors pull up and they 've run in to get their fish and chips that right out of here because of course they 're probably dominate Allan some audience so it became quite famous and he had several bus loads and other people collecting and stuff it was very very funny and very busy but interestingly Allan always maintained contact with the people the cafe and sadly the son died of leukemia and he was only in his thirties he had you know a couple of children and it was it was a very tragic and loved and did a great job and Alan went to the funeral and as did members of the communities like myself and another resident and it really changed the dynamic for a while because of so much sadness around that shop and subsequently they had to give up the lease and a new owners came it was it 's been such a long time actually since it had that feel again of those people who were really connected with us we 're just there doing a job so to have Ashley and Arnold there who are engaging so happily with everyone it 's like we 've resurrected we 've it 's almost a resurrection and it 's been a long time yeah it was sad I really do think that cafe is a key factor they 're very much enjoying that I think particularly Ashley there 's a very sociable outgoing young lady and she talks to anyone everyone the bus drivers anyone 's welcome she 's also very kind and if people can 't get there and need something to eat I know that she will take them that that 's wonderful about that community I know too that the grocer next door also do that so that 's part of living in a small community where people can build up relationships I talked to Ashley quite a lot in the shop and we 've we 've talked about the possibilities of having a street party because one of her observations has been and she said all these people come in here and none of them know each other and so so many people are meeting each other for the first time so that that would be a fun thing to do you _"

    "text": "my name is Paula Tully it used to be Paula Curtis married to Ian for over 40 years we met each other here inches eglamore five years old it was great there were bamboo patches and tadpole ponds and swimming baths and we 're a wonderful wonderful childhood and we weren 't sweethearts when we were young but something grabbed a hole later on and it 's not the place it used to be they had the progress association and they built the barbs and they used to take us on the picnic down the river every year and it was just a wonderland for kid no one went to soccer practice or ballet or you made your own fun heaps of it Billy guards yeah yeah yeah aye Myint ollie yeah I 've was born here inches it go yes this ball said we had a great time as kids here it is a totally different place now growing up the Box Company was was probably at the great big open area which of course is now ball field drive or all the units are and again as kids and quite often we would slip into the box company not allowed to of course but we go down there and go to the wharf and you 'd spearfish leather jackets that sort of thing off around the wharf steps and things like that you 'd never see the caretaker he 'd always be able to get past him the bamboo patch in wither street it was all open area a lot of open area of course down through were burns Crescent there were no houses down that area on one side of the road going down into the park it which is now the park area so I mean that 's all being become quite an extensive residential area around there now but yeah as kids it was a great place to grow up you had to make your own fun Billy carts down with the street you 'd make a billy card out of your ball bearing and you 'd go straight down and over over the birds present and not worry about a car going along burdens president you wouldn 't even know if there was one ever worried about it so end up in the grass down the very end of it because that didn 't go down and that was that was just all dirt at the end of that so there was no road down the bottom I came from burns Crescent down on the water possibly the first one of the first houses down there you go down at low tide and there be you pick up a rock and meat mud gudgeons it 's a little fish that ain 't right under the rock till the tide came back in and then he would go again so I used to pick buckets for them and then tip them in a high tide and where we lived on water there was a rock face and their great big water rats great big ugly water rats they 'll well it 's good to stay away from them but my dad had a wolf or not earn many votes mostly with my name Paula J hey the progress association was was obviously a big thing they did build the bars down there at at the for the local community it was somewhere for the kids to go and safely be able to swim Ian 's best friend Keith mrs. little hunan mentioned his father was the mayor of Des Moines at the time I and got into the progress association in a big way so I thought it 'd be interesting to mention that the ins best friend 's father was was the mayor of the Joint Council which is it anymore interrupt you might like to talk about Devon was swimming across the bus yeah they did that was going that 's going there an apparition point play sorry I just remember dad saying that getting these brothers yes large family family they did oh actually they didn 't they did it from here I better play lacrosse I 'm sure I thought it was a time across this way here to get to the swimming pool no that 's that 's accessible yeah the swimming pool which full you talking about it I thought they used to be swimming what are we going way way back they used to know one over over do but if I thought it was just down because it 's a quite quite a narrow area here they 'd swim across well but I do know that they dad did go out there and they used to have what they call model boats to foot model boats that was a big thing a lot of people like my father and and friends of his cease to race him down in the m5 doc Bay and they often would have to go and swim after the mall row after him to try and catch him if they went over and that was something that they they would do of course and that was well we are going back to times when you would hardly see a boat where you wouldn 't see about more in five not bait it 's it 's quite for normal to see those sort of things now and how it 's built out down there now boat wise I mean it was just something that we hardly see down there I love Chizik and we grew up here and we had a great time I et we 've moved up to sample crisis i said and i get to the point now where I 'm coming down to Sydney is really that one you know I do because among but but it is it is something that I find I like the idea of the way things were I feel sad I suppose you 'd call it nostalgia will be time I come here um as we do come to see now the only reason we come to hell and um I really get an attack of nostalgia ever going to be whoopee sometimes just to remember how it was and how it is now as and I were talking about a little while ago these days it 's a now society whereas we we grew up in a matter of war we would like to have that and week yeah okay well it 's now january or februari and maybe we 'll gather than Christmas you know my uncle actually had the opportunity of buying two houses in Blackwell point road and he didn 't want them and at the ripe old age to purchase them because I could get them very cheap and and even significantly cheaper than what they market value was and my preference was at that time to buy a new car so I decided against that of course age and wisdom it makes you kick yourself sometimes at that sort of opportunity because that the price was quite significant I mean it was only about what six times the price of a new car to buy two blocks of a two at one half full house and virtually a block of land with a house that needed to be demolished people weren 't interested Johnson had done box factory and I had license and down on the river where we we looked over to the Education Department that where they met all the desks and whatnot and all sorts of yeah yogi getting spewed into the bay and there was no retaining wall and every height are every low tide was a peg on the nose job and a block of low cost you just not just nothing nothing they can 't afford to get back into it sunday school as well that was there yeah we 're that 's a nice to actually be in one of the touch sunday school teacher oh yeah what 's interesting is when the actually got the subdivision it were all kevin harvick yes and no the subdivision plans here for eaton place yeah and when that was when that was being named I don 't assembly with the cows like it said to mom like they were suggesting it be called holy place cause a family had been here for so long would you bother him and mum said no miss certain teachers shoot me Jenny make sure sir and that 's how I don 't have a little tonight they didn 't quizzes that she was she was the driving force in in the sunny school I 'm sure you heard about it and Joan asking will tell you about that was in in guests old

Spooner from are you being served an old British sitcom my parents used to watch every Sunday well as I said the roads peninsula has a fascinating history particularly from its industrial time from the early 1900 's this western side of the peninsula was pretty much all factories see this picture here on the right of the railway track are all houses and on the left just a really big industrial center and it was like this for quite a long time one of the most well-known of these factories was the old Louis Berger Sons paint factory which used to sit right here where you 're standing that 's why factory was massive in fact when it was built it was supposedly the largest timber structure in the southern hemisphere cool right it covered a pretty large area taking up a lot of where the roads waterside shopping center is today berger paints started over 200 years ago in what I like to think of as a little hidden chemistry lab in London 's back streets it was seventeen sixty and a young chemist called Lewis steigenberger was quietly crafting a new colorings lap prussian blue using a secret manufacturing process on its launch this special Prussian blue was such a hit that enabled Lewis who changed his last name to Birju any marriage to build his paints company from the ground up 150 years later in 1916 the company opened its first factory in Australia right here in roads and in its time in Australia the management of the company passed an interrupted from father to son for four generations so I found this write-up about the Burgess Factory in the sydney morning herald from 1927 the journalist was clearly impressed in 1916 it was decided to establish a and quarter acres in excellent condition was secured at Rhodes ten miles by rail from Sydney and on this land was built one of the finest plants in the world for the manufacture of white LED paints varnishes enamels allied products such an accomplishment during wartime despite rapidly increasing costs and the great difficulties in the way of transporting heavy machinery is a wonderful tribute to the Dauntless spirit of Australian industry sorry the factory sounded pretty impressive but I wonder what it was like working at the famous berger paints throughout the works the utmost care is paid to the hygiene and the comfort and well-being of the employees all workmen are provided with overalls by the company and are allowed ample time for careful washing before meals and before leaving the factory the management most proudly of the fact that there has not been one single instance of industrial trouble of any kind since the day on which the work starting truly this is a wonderful tribute to these Australian workmen it seems workers were treated pretty well at Verger and I also got to meet Valerie who job my role at burges was as a typist and I would also relieve on the switchboard I can just remember having to walk up these stairs to get into the factory and it was always fairly noisy and like the smell of the paint I was always quite blessed to get up a bit berger paints really became an iconic Australian company in 1923 it joined other Ozzie brands like Burley uncle tobys and toys to form the australian-made preference league and in 1932 it painted the entire Sydney Harbour Bridge with 60,000 gallons of protective paint you can 't get more Aussie than that now while burj emerged with jus luxe paints in 1988 we still like to celebrate that determined and innovative spirit that stemmed from right here in roads so for us berger paints just keeps on keeping on good booty paints keep on keepin on let 's remember that in there I 'd yes alright time to move on to our next story location head down the walking path towards the foreshore in river keep a lookout for the cheeky cartwheeling youngster that 's where our next story starts _"

wanted to be in the fire brigade and I guess it was in my blood I joined Brigade in 1966 a history in Brigade goes back to early days when her family were were in that in the brigade parades fire brigades actually one of the last remaining New South Wales Fire Brigade staff I retain firefighters in Sydney the equipment shakes today we just need to do the standard equipment sheets it was actually built on land owned by my family the Mac Alliance there 's some house out there three generations of our family have now been captains of the brigade so if we can just get started on that my grandfather 's full name was Charles Albert verdant Mikola we built a house in Rhodes in around 1912 and moved in around 1915 it was quite different to what it is now I may know a of his chemical factories and ways because of the factories they had some substantial fires there we 've got was a small area was rated as a very high risk my grandfather I was instrumental in getting the fire brigade set up and provided the initially a shed the hell 's the fire brigade in 1921 Brigade had eight volunteers a lot of people were worship workers of local factories it started off with what they called a hose reel which firefighters would grab at the front in the back and push it up the rider to wherever the head together he when my grandfather died in 1946 my father became captain Sade probably burning the brigade about five or six years that time he was a Charles Victor McCoy he authorized now by Vic brigade recognized his service in in the late seventies where affirmed the Queen 's fire service medal my name is Nick Marcus and I work as a retained firefighter or flight risk in New South Wales at Rhodes fire station I 've been living in Rhodes since I was five years old I was 21 when I first joined I of the careers I thought I 'd excel it and be exciting and something you want to take part in you know you kind of watch farmer Sam gone up and you see the fly try to fly past like they 've got big jobs big fliers rescuing you know people and this and that and you get anything realized you do get those type of incidences but then it 's a bit dirty as well you know it 's a lot of maintenance and cleaning work got to make sure that all the gear is up to standard so when we go to a job it will never fail on us we know that it 's they 're ready to work I 've been at Rhodes fire station since 2004 so the junior starting and didn 't know anything about firefighting right at the beginning at the time I worked in a regional office for yourself I was five rig aides and I was actually about to do the recruitment process with the station and was typing up the advertisement and thought wow this is everything I want it 've never even thought of beforehand there 's a whole another part to the fire brigade than just fighting fires there 's the community safety side which is my particular passion and that 's about getting the message across to our community and trying to help people to prevent fires our targeted groups used to be small children well that 's changed now to actually be more the cultural background in the language barriers so there 's all different types of communication methods that we need to use to get the message across to try and prevent the fire when it was accepted to enter its fire station my mom and dad were really excited but mum always had the concern of well what does this mean are you gonna be safe everyone else runs out of a fire why are you running into a fight why would you choose to do something like that at roads were often called upon to staff extra trucks and in the 2013 bush fire we were protecting property up there and the wind changed on us and it got quite hairy and Simon Rural Fire Service firefighters they had no truck so they were actually clinging to the side of the truck the flame actually came over the top of us the top of the fire truck and I was the driver that they had to drive through what I described as a firestorm couldn 't see anything they were cleaner to the truck while I drove through to the end we 're so lucky to have survived when we think that one hour I 've been in roads fire-brigade for a long time just coming up to 49 years when I joined we probably had about a hundred calls hundred twenty calls to you these days beginning around eight hundred calls I think my family instill that the responsibility to the community and the importance of observing the community if we 've got to provide a service that 's reliable and that the community can count those great staff we 've been a massive influence in my career there who knows what he 's done and you know he knows how to run a fire station his father did a grandfather did 's really good to be a part of you know you get to work with a lot of good people because they come in to grab right reasons basically I 'm just so proud to serve the community of Rhodes and wanted to do something for my community because being a retained firefighters you you 're living in your hometown I 'd like to see our crew probably expand a little bit more multiculturally and and get a few more members on that reflect our community that we 're serving over the years where we 've been under threat of being closed but always got up in the morning and said no organifi this and always had people around me saying no really we don 't abrogate

cool name we 're gonna find out why these little birds are so special how far they travel to get here what they love what they don 't love and how we can help handle them with care no touching of course okay come with me it 's adventure time [Music] bartel godwitz do they only live here or what 's their story their story is they fly around the world in a big circle part of their life is spent here on the parramatta river which is really important and part of their life is spent in the northern hemisphere in alaska and siberia now i read a pretty incredible fact maybe you can tell me if it 's correct that bartow godwits can travel without stopping 11 000 kilometers from alaska to new zealand is that right that 's correct so if they don 't stop how do they so what they eat before they leave is really important they need to get fat all muscle ready to go and fly and not stop just incredible and where do the bar-tailed godwits eat they 'll eat in places like this here here right here but this is not where they have their babies when they 've had their babies when they 've laid their eggs they come back here so around the world they go their whole lifetime is a circle around the world and if we look under our feet you can see lots of little holes in the sand that 's cause these little gribblies little worms little creatures there that they like to eat with their special bills they 've got really really long bills for poking into that soft mud so they can 't just stop anywhere and eat wherever they stop they have to come to specific places that have their food they do mud flats shallow water when they go the other way to where they breed they 'll go through china and the yellow sea wow so these little bar-tailed godwares that that we 're standing today with the rest of the world like china and alaska that 's it it 's amazing isn 't it the other year we found some godwit feathers oh oh they 're so beautiful and you know what they 're all worn out because they flew that huge long distance when they get here they shed their feathers they mulch and grow new strong ones if you 've flown 12 000 kilometers you might be a bit worn out too yes so these feathers have probably been to alaska china all across the ocean all the way here that 's it wow they 're so special and so small little things can do great big things can 't they i always say little things make a big difference judy i do and are godwit 's thriving at the moment unfortunately no many of these migratory shore birds are in big trouble because they 're losing their feeding spots along the way along the flyway it 's called the way they go all sorts of mud flats and places are disappearing it 's just sad but um make it the best we can for when they are here [Music] how can we handle the godwits with care well we can look after them and protect where they 're feeding that 's the most important thing to do in australia these mud flats very tempting to walk out here ride your bike let your dog run free not to disturb them is the most important thing so leave them some space and don 't disturb them then we 've also got dogs keeping dogs on leads yes that 's right there are places that dogs can run around and have good fun but this is not a place like that your dog should be on a lead and keep him away from these mud flats even if we think that they won 't disturb them if they 're on a lead they 're more predictable for the guys absolutely dogs and dogs they 'll chase birds we never know and then finally we know that the final piece of the picture is plastic that 's right there 's no such thing as the way and even better than bottle and coffee cup that 's what i like i 've got my reusable coffee cup i 've got a coffee cup from the local school which made the fantastic signs that are here about dogs saves bird by keeping your dog on a lead what a rocking community it is rocking community should we go and have a look for some signs of bartow godwits now have you prepared to get muddy me i 'm always ready to get grubby let 's go here they are dirt girl look a whole flock of guide widths how do they fly so far when they 're so small they just have to have maximum flight muscles they say they look like flying bricks they 're all muscle and you know the godwits weigh about as much as a big jar of vegemite which is not much that 's cool so a jar of vegemite flying across the world except they don 't like vegemite in other places [Laughter] well we like the godwits here they do and resting there not being disturbed is really really important [Music] yes more information on say that do not scare or approach the birds she said that too put all rubbish in the bin got it that 's the three yes seriously how amazing are the bar tailed godwits they 're so small they fly so far without stopping without eating i could never do that i love my morning tea they 're just incredible no wonder the community here wants to protect them i challenge you residents of canada bay to pledge to protect the vital god with show you care by heading to the canada bay council website and signing the pledge to save the god [Music] wits _"

    "text": "the moonlight breeds on Walker house and softens scrub and Hill the native trees are strangely stirred the pines are very still the nurses Latin Flitz and flits and pain and sorrow cease for all the patients are asleep and all is rest and peace [Music] World War two affected everyone as the Japanese offensive ramped up in the southwest Pacific more and more Australian women were putting up their hands to support our soldiers on the front line nurse 's aides and support staff there were thousands of brave women risking their lives to help stop the Japanese but with more women at war more and more returning each month sicker engine so in March 1943 the government decided to set up the third Australian Women 's Hospital in this grand building that you see in front of you for this story please stick to the foreshore trail and don 't venture into the main building as that present it operates as a school the first time I remember seeing this hospital was around I suppose 1944 when I came to visit my aunt who was a in the a patient down in number 3 women 's hospital but is now a Reuben donor we set out in the garden and I can remember the Showboat going up the river and it was it had a voiceover telling people walk like we 're seeing on the riverbank and I remember the voice saying in a singsong sort of a way this is the soldier essence place and I remember turning round to my aunt and saying what 's a soldier is and she said your art is and so am I you can just imagine Jan 's aren 't and the other women sitting out on these lawns here with the Sun filtering down through the trees looking out at the water a world away from where they 'd just been it would have been such a welcome respite from the war [Music] the Red Cross also set up what they call the Hut in the grounds for therapy for the patients where they could go and learn craft work and things like that we 've got quite a lot of samples of that in our museum which were Bay Heritage Society who regularly take tours through Rivendell and enjoy shedding some light on its intriguing past the story all starts with the successful nineteenth-century businessman and philanthropist Thomas Walker just before Thomas died he put a codicil in he 's we 're leaving a hundred thousand pound to build a hospital honored point just opposite from here Ella it took in patients some convalescent hospitals around Sydney they could stay for a month with no charge if they wanted to contribute they could but all there were no cost to them for anything there it was all free if you look carefully you might be able to find some of Thomas Walker 's insignia itched into the buildings on the Arella estate so the story went that at some time in walkers midlife a homeless man knocked on his door looking for help Walker turned him away only for his staff to discover the man the next day lying dead in the gatehouse on his estate after this happened Walker went on to establish a trust fund for homeless men and years later on his death his will in my mind to establish on part of my land here a hospital on a somewhat extensive scale for the reception and restoration to health of convalescent patients from the hospitals of Sydney or elsewhere this was written in Thomas Walker 's will and so in 1891 work began on the construction of the Thomas Walker convalescent hospital this was the original purpose of this grand building and extensive grounds a peaceful place for patients to rest and recuperate in [Music] the project was overseen by architect John sörman and what is called a Queen Anne style of architecture popular in 1870s in England but it 's also mixed with a number of other eclectic influences like the statues of the six women standing high up in the clock tower can you see them I love these and each time I come here I feel like they 're almost looking down on me they are calm and strong these statues are actually influenced by the ancient Greeks Cyclades that you can see in buildings like the Acropolis on completion the hospital here could house up to 70 patients at a 's got the main central section Allu towers which was for staff and that sort of work and then there were two pavilions to either side one was for the women and one was for the men they had their own dining rooms and things in the central kitchen in the early days the patients all came by water are you down near the water gate at the river 's edge if not head over there I sometimes wonder when patients arrived here from Circular key and looked up at the main hospital building whether or not they felt nervous at the imposing size of the hospital or relief to be away from the hustle and bustle of the city we never really know but we do get a sense of how patients felt staying at the hospital from one account written in 1893 one might vainly search the world over to find a parallel institution so admirably have nature and art combined to form an ideal resting place for the weak and weary as you wander through the corridors and rooms of the princely structure you wonder at the for the erection of the building but for the maintenance of its patients in such unstinted fashion so while you can see the hospital is grand from the outside I would say it 's even more impressive once you step inside as you open the front doors the front entrance leads to a beautiful chapel which has a series of stained glass windows with the central one showing the Walker family crest a picture of waves crashing down on ragged rocks and an almost disturbing all-seeing eye peering out of you I believe this is meant to be the eye of God watching out over us but I 've read it also might have links to Freemasonry I 'm not sure I 'll leave that one to the more curious of you to go home and research underneath the crest is the family motto in Latin various Casas which means through many journeys now it 's hard for us to know what this meant to the walkers but we do know they worked hard to achieve what they did in their lifetimes they bravely faced many journeys and it was the lives of so many people in this hospital alone there have been more than 70,000 patients since it first opened its doors including one well-known Australian poet Henry Lawson and hundreds of returned service women from World War two even today the Thomas Walker Hospital is used as a school and a place of healing for young people facing their own challenges and that 's why when the school was founded here in 1977 it was decided to change the name of the hospital to Rivendell just like the Rivendell in Tolkien 's The Hobbit a place of sanctuary for those on difficult journeys there is a stately home rest where all the scene is fair and in the Sun the ripples run along the river there it was builded in the noon day dream of one of kindly wealth in the hope that many sufferers should be restored to health _"

going to be like I wasn 't sure what we were going to be building all they told us was it was a sustainable form of transport so basically we could have been building anything a little bit reticent to start because I said that you know I said I didn 't have any practical skills we didn 't know we could make it at the start it would it be like harder like we couldn 't do it but we ended up doing it it 's pretty fun I certainly didn 't know what to expect it was going to be an experience for me for sure you saw the wondering how are you going to get on with them and how work but it seems to gel quite world I had basically no idea I thought might be a bit weird but it hasn 't been it 's been really fun to have a go at it oh just coming with a up and no and you see where that when you get here my impression of teenage boys everybody was a loner nobody participated in community organizations I thought they would all just draw and my around in bed and a father I gonna be a old like I can 't walk on I don 't do it I 'd like brain loss probably through that the media that you get these these strange pictures of people doing all sorts of things that are not so nice and of course this is contrary to the whole lot of oh it 's great it 's fantastic the one on one with the kids with the mentors and that I think they both got a lot of out of it has been a lot of fun so the guy I 'm working with these it eases he 's got bags of enthusiasm ease cleaners and actually just can you just got to harness it and put it push it in the right direction he respects you for who you are he he he do you know who is his dawn with that looks today like is up there talking he 's a nice guy hyperactive i think i have a john just the opposite so you 're slowing down a bit and now no I 've got a fine with you actually he 's always pleased to see me ever every Friday so I must be doing something right a starfish cancer is really good at like so I 'm some stuff like he just like a new look and then go so that 's sort of bad but he doesn 't notice like the paint job the day after the first session the kids came back and I asked them how it went and they just said it was fabulous the kids just clicked with the moon tools I think me and lament or work really well as a team I think why we 'll stay in touch with my mentor but they 're coming good friends and it 's really fun to work with them general in society that connection has largely been lost because the family structure has changed as much as it used to sell a lot of guys are missing out and you think it 's the kids missing out but it 's the other way as well the older guys are missing here so this is a really good way of bringing it together you know I could see it happening in high schools and men 's sheds right across Australia I think that it 's important because younger generations and other generations probably wouldn 't communicate and do things with each other very much but with this program it gives them an opportunity to do that it would also came the bridge the Assam limb gap you know the more you associate with any in beat your group the list they become them you know now I know that they offer could you be working on them well I think the first thing I 've learned is young people a lot of fun a lot of lot of interest and log ideas and imagination which sometimes you get older you tend to lose one thing that really came to be strongly was that they want are less fortunate within so far we 've built two wheelchairs so we 've got two parts of a bike and back wheels stuck them on the sides put a seed honor we 're sending to Africa because there 's a lot of people that can 't use their legs there you just feel good at youth health people and you 've had fun at the same time building a arm it 's like a homeless sort of home on wheels tickle it off the tuna to help people I reckon it 's like Christian and all that particularly when we got onto the canoe which finished the wheelchairs so everybody was working on the canoe it brought us all together in a much deeper way the group that we work with is really fun to be around Nolan 's nasty to each other building stuff mini good company making new friends they were the family atmosphere that certainly is starting to form now yeah everyone gets along and jokes around build stuff everyone thinks our young guys will learn some sort of woodwork skill some metalwork skill you know it and they do learn that but more so I think they you can 't put your finger on it but they learn from just being with these older guys who been through all sorts of storms in their lives I think although ads are very good they 're they 're different they have their problems with the with each other at times but overall I mean super it 's good to see how they I think they 've developed actually from me from the experience I 've witness the enthusiasm tomb work helping the other bloke out it 's a shame that we 're finishing because it 's the same to be complete harmony throughout but the ball is in the end the same yes I 've got anything negative really buffet about it they got out of it a fair bit in terms of well unbearable I 'm being able to cut on contributing non-variable to this young man I 've learned quite a bit about building stuff and just hanging out as people I just would love this project to continue on if it were possible I happens I think it was great hopefully it has been had a big impact on them that our eyes are okay too you you _"

because Rose lots of new people moving here then I just thought you know we need a kind of organization to help people newly immigrating into roads and help them to have to get involved in the community they might perform as well I became involved because i live in rhodes and i walk on the foreshore it 's a great town to live in I seen this group performing stopped started a a conversation in very broken Mandarin or broken English and understood a little bit more about them caught up for a coffee and from there we started to work together and create a community organization beyond dance to being more involved in teaching Mandarin teaching English and organizing festivals and celebrations I 'd like to see this community get a greater voice in local government state government already we 've got four members of the rmc a involved with the city of Canada Bayon advisory community body they were never involve 12 months ago now we see young leaders from the community that were born in other countries representing their community speaking up and getting results for their community jung kim and i 'm from south korea i 've been involved in rmc I for a less than a year by now I 've

came to share two years ago when I first arrived in Sydney I felt I was not the full member of this community of this society but the partly was because of the language and the culture and the costumes that I had and what everything is new so the systems and I don 't know what to do in which is situation all the eltrons some stank it but after I got involved in the roads community then I found more people who experiences the similar things that I had experienced and we share the knowledge and our experiences and feel more comfortable and what is more important is that my contribution to the community is appreciated that I can do something as a more now our mca has lots of activities we organize all different Chinese festivals Roseman festival chinese new year festival and we have the professional business network it 's going on as well so it 's running really really well getting really really busy I think the performances are a very important part of the the festival having great foods important but sharing different cultures and last year we had everything from jazz to Chinese dancers and singers to Korean drummers and swords people we want to promote cultural diversity race has done a lot of damage and creating division in society and we want to make our contribution to building bridges in promoting multiculturalism roman era una momento de da en todo tango Tony and

    "text": "I 'm kabiri today we 're going to learn how to make soap at home right in your kitchen because it 's plastic for July it 's super fun to make you can do it with the kids at home the school holidays you save a ton of plastic packaging throughout July and Beyond and it 'll also save money alright so today we 're gonna make about 500 grams of soap and I 'm going to go through the list of ingredients that we 'll need these are our base ingredients which you will need to make any kind of soap so the first one is caustic soda or lye you can buy them at Bunnings or online they 're like a little crystals that you can see here and they 're the one this is the one that will initiate the whole saponification process now so verification process sounds fancy but really it 's just saying that you 're converting all the fats that you 've got all the oils that you 've got here into soap I 've got some caustic soda got some water here just vegetable oil and coconut oil so they 're all measured out in grams and not volumes so it 's important to measure them in grams and you can see the measurements on your screen here and today I 'm making it a bit fancy so I 've got some activated charcoal here is their trendy got some assurance to oil is just making it my own so I got some peppermint here and I 've got some bergamot essential oil and and I 'm using some recycled coffee ground just from my morning cuppa Bri this morning once you have all these ingredients ready we 'll put all of these together in a pot here just make sure they 're not aluminum and that you 're only using this for cooking soap and nothing else and I 've just got to make shift double boiler years just so that the heat is not directly on the itself all these ingredients go in here and they 'll get whizzed up with the stick blender if you don 't want to use your stick blender because he can 't use this for will just take a bit longer and you 'll just some more muscles and I 've got a lift in here to shake my soap just lined up with baking paper baking paper and most importantly safety so make sure you were in full sleep clothes got some gloves here and safety goggles just so that you the caustic soda doesn 't burn your skin so the first thing you want to do is make sure you 've got gloves on and your safety goggles on so the first thing we do is dissolve the caustic soda in water now you want to do this in a well-ventilated area because it does produce fumes and just make sure that you 're putting the caustic soda in water not the other way around because that you make it splashes if you put the water in caustic soda so I 'm just going to go ahead and put some caustic soda in water slowly dissolve it stirring it slowly now just a little bit until you can 't see any crystals at the bottom and just be as I said just be quite strong and the glass itself can start getting a bit hot so just be mindful of that I 'm gonna leave that on my kitchen windowsill just to properly dissolve again make sure it is in a ventilated area so now I 've just put all the oil so I 've got coconut oil olive oil and vegetable oil all in the pot here and I 've started the heating so I 'm just melting all the oils here in medium heat until it 's all the oils are completely melted and this is just a double boiler I make sure double boiler that I 've just made it 's just got a pot underneath with hot water and just something to hold on top of that the top pot and just this one here remember this pot is the only one that you can 't use for cooking so just make sure it 's an old pot so there might really last pieces of coconut oil that you 're tracing around to melt but we 're looking good now we 're all good to go so now we some activated charcoal to start blitzing all right so now we are about to add the caustic soda to our oil mix remember if you 're doing this with kids it 's best to do it yourself because you are dealing with caustic soda and hot liquids so make sure you 've got still got your gloves on so just gently add them to your hot mix make sure you 're not splashing them at that through and then at this point at your activated charcoal as well get that a good stir remember this is all while the heat is still going on just on low heat so you 're not burning the oil now that it 's nice and well mixed up we 're going to start blitzing so now we 're going to start blitzing and you 're gonna place them in pulses and stir in between those pulses what you 're looking for is a trace at the end of this so what a trace is is all the older oils have been neutralized by lye and the mixture thickens up slightly as to a point mark left by on the surface of the mixture I 'm gonna start doing that now [Music] [Applause] [Music] remember if you 're using a whiskey can just keep whisking as [Music] okay so we started with a pole splits now we 're going full blitzing the mixture while just slowly stirring around this might take you up to five minutes at the most so I keep going so we 've been blitzing this for about four minutes now and you know you 've reached race is when it thickens up and when you pull it out it leaves a mark of the blender just on the surface here so that 's when you know you 've reached race now you don 't listen more than this one because that would make it so flaky so that 's it okay so now we 've reached the trace so now we 're going to cook this salad mixture so just going to put a lid on in medium heat and it can take about 20 minutes or so a good tip is to use a bigger pot because the mixture can and make sure you keep an eye on it and and see what 's happening okay so now you know when it 's cooked is um when the consistency of this turns into a gel and you can think of a vaseline gel a light consistency where it becomes slightly translucent at this point you want to add your essential oil drop that in and your coffee grounds so see how much you need you may not need the whole bowl and then just stir that around give it a good stir that 's all mixed properly well that 's what 's nice yes [Music] okay so that looks ready all our coffee grounds are mixed in just a tip don 't make sure you 're not putting too much essential oil because that will make your bar a bit soft so now we 'll put them in the mold and we 're good to go all right that 's it guys put the soap in the mold giving it a slight tap to take all the bubbles out now we 're gonna leave this for at least 24 hours it out cut it into bars and that 's it that 's your homemade soul DIY plastic region I _"

meeting on today can i also acknowledge all of you and welcome you all to this webinar it 's a special event and it 's unfortunate that we need to host it because of the situation we 're in but we 're here anyway and we 're going to push through can i uh especially thank andrew lockheed from new south wales treasury matthew eraser from service new south wales wally mahana i 'm sure you all know from the bankstown chamber of commerce and of course our accounting experts from zary ceo ahmed trad and collaborate director lee alas tomorrow i 'm um i 'm overwhelmed but i 'm not shocked by the number of businesses that have registered for today 's virtual event and you don 't need me to tell you how tough uh lockdowns have been on the business community and if it 's not locked downs it 's a me threat of a lockdown and from what i 'm being told the cumbersome and complex access to covert support payments as i was going through the list of businesses registered for today 's event i noticed that you represent that you are representative of some 37 and a half thousand businesses in our city whether it 's hairdressers cafe owners dry cleaners mechanics florists and of course many others from small businesses to some of our larger manufacturers not forgetting of course our tradies and our construction industry look i 'm not going to sit here and tell you we 're all in this together as i think you 're pretty tired of hearing those words and as you can see homeschooling is not easy for all of us but i will tell you what i have seen and i 've seen the empty businesses and the empty streets and i 've heard stories of businesses just hanging on i 've also heard your concerns about how many of you are still confused when it comes to accessing support payments and i 'm really hoping that you get some answers today where we can at the tough times that we 're in there are concerns like payments taking an eternity to filter through difficulties navigating the website not sure on the criteria for eligibility what grants or funding your business qualifies for and new businesses are you know i don 't want them falling through the cracks considering they don 't have any financials from 2019 that you can that the government can compare to so um you know another most common question obviously is what documentation you need to provide what 's the proof that you need to provide these are all i think reasonable questions and i 'm really confident our experts here today will be able to answer them for you so um not much more from me i hope you get something out of this and on behalf of council please take this opportunity to really get involved thank you everyone uh thank you mayor for your comments and for initiating this webinar i think i 'll speak on behalf of us all um before i introduce wally from the chamber of commerce i just want to give a plug um of uh dynamic businesses that get together regularly and wally himself he 's um a consummate networker and he 's been very generous um i 've certainly experienced that and um people in in my team and with the council return that and wally 's always all too happy to just introduce um around and introduce you to people so let me give that plug before wally mohenna i 'll ask you to say a few words thank you mike can you hear me yeah thank you mike for your current words my gratitude to your team regard to me fellow councillors and the management at the council this is a good opportunity about how our community are working together in the spirit of team and a spirit of collaboration and the focus is about helping our community to be the ideal destination and to be the team not in just good times but in the bad times and this is an ideal moment that how we can showcase and support each other and back each other and advocate for those businesses who are falling through the crack and i the uh reading the uh the too many pages of the rules and regulations and the policies are read in the fine prints and then they discover themselves for it 's falling through the crack so i want to thank zari and collaborate for extending their time at the moment to help with their insights but most importantly the learning experience from today is we are here to support each other don 't hold back you shouldn 't suffer alone reach out to anyone from council or chamber and we can advocate on your behalf all the way to the highest office in the land so i won 't take much of your time thank you mike again and we look forward to hearing uh key issues from our from our local business community and we 'll see how we can provide solutions thank you thank you wally um and again let me give a shout out to the chamber if any businesses online i would like to be um introduced and either contact wally or myself and willa rhones for that um i 'd now like to um introduce a senior analyst with new south wales treasury and he 's going to be talking about the grants and support that are available to businesses uh during coldweight 19. so andrew over to you thank you mike and thank you for that introduction and thanks for setting up this session so that we can go through a bit of some information about what what different support packages we have and what 's been announced so far i 'm just going to share my screen so bear with me for just a second and there we go we should be can i just mike maybe can you see the screen there it should say new south wales government business support i 'm not yet time to no technicals there we go how 's that there we go well done okay you 're good to go andrew wonderful so yes thank you thank you again mike and thank you for having us here today uh looking forward to sharing some of our insights and um participating in a q a later on to address some of your pressing questions but before i that i 'm coming to you from the land of the gadigal people of the euro nation and i would like to pay my sex to elders past present and emerging so i know this is a session about what business support is available but i first want to start first want to touch on what 's available to individuals because i think it links quite closely in with the broader business support package and the cornerstone of this support for individuals is the commonwealth october 19 disaster payment uh so this is a payment for individuals who have lost hours of work and it is available to business to individuals across new south wales now while this payment is available for business owners themselves that have lost hours if if you 're a business owner you can 't receive both the commonwealth 's disaster payment and also a business grant individually but i 'll come back and go through this in a bit more detail when i 'm coming towards the grants on the next slide your employees however if your employees have lost hours of work they can wales business grant but there 's also support for residential tenants um support for homelessness services and also an increase in mental health services and i know it is a tough time for everyone at the moment so there are some numbers on the screen now on that bottom part about mental health support if you do need it moving on to support for micro businesses so this is aimed at those businesses with a turnover between thirty thousand and seventy thousand that 's an annual turnover between thirty thousand and seventy five thousand these businesses that need to have a at least a thirty percent decline in in turnover and i know that there will be some questions on the comparison period and not having the right documentation from 2019 or new businesses and we 'll come on to that later in the q a session um but just as a starting point the the key criteria is that then there needs to be a 30 decline with this in the lockdown period so the micro business screen it 's a 1500 per fortnight amount backdated to the start 26th of june and it 'll be provided for the duration of the lockdown uh so currently the end of august and hopefully it stays that way essentially this means successful businesses will receive just over six and a half thousand dollars over the course of about nine weeks applications for this grant are now open on the service new software service new south wales website and although support nightly payment you only have to apply once and you 'll receive the full amount i believe my colleague matt from service new south wales will talk you through what the actual application process form looks like after i finish essentially what you 'll you 'll need to provide in terms of evidence evidence of your annual turnover so this could be a business activity statement uh evidence of your decline in turnover as i mentioned now this will typically be a letter from a qualified accountant a tax agent or a bas agent or it could be a business bank account statements that enable service new south wales to compare the two relevant periods you 'll also need to declare for example that you make at least 50 of your income from this business and that if you have employees you 'll maintain you 'll maintain your head count look i know there is some concern at the moment in terms of the processing times for service new south wales and i think matt might touch on this as well but it is important to remember that the service new south wales staff has to assess all this information for each applicant the demand for this program and others has been through the roof understandably of course given the current situation but in each case this high demand is this high demand means that applications are taking longer than expected to assess and process service new subfiles are currently recruiting and they 're looking for more staff to bring on to help with the assessment process and help speed it up in terms of what you can use the micro business grant on you can use this this funding to cover business expenses which could include your own wages or salary if you 're self-employed utilities or insurance payments or as it currently stands you are not eligible for the micro grant if you receive the commonwealth disaster payment since the greater sydney lockdown commenced so if you 've received disaster payment since the 26th of june you won 't be eligible for the micro business grant even if you only received one disaster payment the reason for this is because the payment the disaster payment is for a period covered by the micro grant so you can 't have two two sets of government assistance at the same time essentially given this some business owners that have previously received a disaster payment before and stopped in the anticipation of receiving this micro grant or other business grants may instead decide to reapply for the disaster payment particularly now the value of the disaster payment is equivalent to the value of the micro grant so 750 a week for 1500 per fortnight moving on to support with my tenancy and you 'll see on this slide the the measures that we 've got to try and support retail and commercial tenants so the government enacted regulation back in july that drawing on a bond against an eligible tenant without first attempting mediation these protections are for all retail and commercial tenants that have had an annual turnover of under 50 million in the 2020-21 financial year and are eligible for one of the business grants so the micro grant the business grant or the job server essentially what this means is they must have had a turnover decline of at least 30 given that this is the key criteria for all of these new south wales business grants look it 's important to note in terms of the retail and commercial leases regulation it doesn 't give tenants an automatic right to a rent reduction instead the government 's offering land tax concessions of up to 100 for those landlords who do reduce the rent of eligible tenants and we are currently monitoring monitoring the situation between landlords and tenants we know it is tough out there and we 're looking to adjust the policy if necessary when it comes to supporting support for your tenancy the new south wales small business commission is the source of truth for these the regulation says it 's also available in different languages the commission starts though they can 't give legal advice so they won 't be able to advise on your specific situation and they may refer you to legal advice if you do call up the small business commission 's mediation services team are also available to help parties negotiate an outcome uh negotiate rent release perhaps in a non-adversarial and a cost-effective way for urgent situations it 's such as if you 've if your landlord has locked you out you can still urgently apply to ncap and follow the usual procedures there moving on to the next slide which is i guess the cornerstone of business grants so we 've got first up the covert 19 business grants these are the ones that were first announced so this is for businesses with a turnover of more than 75 000. the cover 19 business grants are tiered depending on the decline in revenue so it 's a seven seven and a half thousand dollar grant for a thirty percent decline ten and a half thousand for a fifty percent mentioned this grant was part of the first support package that the government announced way back when we thought this lockdown was on the event for two or three weeks as such it 's only aimed at providing release for the first three weeks of the lockdown so that 's the period from the 26th of june to the 17th of july when the government realised that the lockdown was going to be extended we developed the job savings program in conjunction with the commonwealth and i 'll touch on this in a moment in terms of eligibility for the business grants as i said turnover above 75 000 and at least a 30 decline in turnover if you 're an employing business you 'll also have to maintain your employee head count in terms of what evidence you need to provide generally is generally you 'll need to provide some sort of documentation uh although this can depend on what industry you 're in if you do need to provide documentation this will typically include a tax return or a notice notice of assessment combined with a letter from you 've experienced that particular decline in turnover that you 're claiming there are templates for these letters on the service new south wales website if you 're a non-employing business you cannot receive the business grant if you receive the commonwealth disaster payment from the 26th of june to the 17th of july if you 've got employees however they can still access the disaster payment and you can receive jobs you can receive a business grant just as to cover business expenses moving on to job favor which i guess is the key the key support that has been announced more recently this is a fortnightly payment made to businesses that have had at least a 30 decline in turnover it 's aimed at providing relief from week four of the lockdown onwards so from the 18th of july to the end of the lockdown so it 's about six weeks worth of payments or three four nights if you 're an employing business the payment is equivalent to forty percent of your weekly payroll at a minimum of fifteen hundred and a maximum of a hundred thousand payment 's a thousand dollars per week your weekly payroll is assessed by in terms of when we 're working out how much you 're going to get that service new south wales assess your weekly payroll by referring to calculations in your most recent business activity statement that 's provided to the ato prior to the lockdown with job saver you must also declare that you maintain your employee head count now with all this employee head criteria that i 've mentioned for the various brands if you do lose employees for circumstances outside your control for example they resign or for disciplinary reasons this won 't be counted now if you 're a non-employing business you can 't receive job favor if you received a disaster payment since the 18th of july if you 've got employees however similar to the business grant they can access the disaster payment and you as the the business owner can receive jobs over businesses that applied for and receive the business grants will be you will generally be automatically eligible for jobs over given that they 've already demonstrated that there further information on employee headcount and payroll just so that service new south wales can work out how much what the value of the grant is going to be just lastly on this slide in terms of payroll tax relief so revenue new south wales is offering a variety of different measures in terms of payroll tax relief they 're providing 25 reduction in the 2021-22 payroll tax liability for businesses um with australian wages of under 10 million dollars to experience the 30 decline revenue are still working through what this actually looks like in practice and we 'll have more information on their website on more information on their website on this measure towards the end of the month secondly they 're also changing the due dates the lodgements and payments of 2021 payroll tax that 's been extended to the 7th of october 2021 they 're also offering uh just offering deferrals if you 'd like to proceed that way for july and august payroll tax payments until the 7th of october 2021. that means all payroll tax could be deferred um up until the the 7th and i think i 'm running a bit under time so that 's good for now um and this is this is about sector based support so support for individual sectors firstly up the top there we 've obviously got the support for tenancies again so it 's important to note that doesn 't just apply to micro businesses that applies to all all retail and commercial tenants um that have a turnover of under 50 million in the 2021 financial year and you know made that 30 declining in revenue criteria terms of creative creative art support so this is provided by create new south wales it 's aimed at providing urgent financial support for for performing art venues producers and promoters impacted by the cancellation of the postponement of performances due to covert 19. applications for this package they opened on friday the 23rd of july uh once again via the create new south wales website finally accommodation provider support so this is particularly for accommodation providers that lost bookings or have a number of cancellations over the recent winter school holidays businesses will get two thousand dollars for if they 've lost more than 11 room nights in cancellations now the accommodation provider support isn 't live yet as service new south wales resources are being dedicated to delivering other grants we 'd suggest that uh accommodation providers apply for the business grant first so either the 2021 business grant or job saver all the micro grants if they you know don 't make a lot of revenue and to receive more urgent relief and it looks like that is it for me for now um so that 's good just over under 20 minutes um so but i will be back with the q a where we can go through in a bit more detail in terms of uh the comparison period and potentially documentation that are required for evidence thanks very much mike thank you andrew and thank you for sharing those slides i think um the way you put it together was really clear so thank you for that um just a reminder to everyone who 's watching today and part of this webinar that if you do have

bear with me for a moment so one thing i would like to go over especially because andrew has gone over the particular grants and support out there for businesses is just navigating our service new south new south wales website we do have a quite a useful tool called the covert 19 assistance finder which identifies not only business requirements but also requirements for the individual needs every business and individual has different type of circumstances that they may be facing so in regards to funding in regards to their business grants programs it may be in regards to safe work mental health and so forth so as you can see on my screen i 've just jumped onto the the service it easy in regards to looking for the covered 19 page especially around grants and individual support so what we 've done is created a clear yellow banner up on the top of the website that has a link straight into the curved 19 page another useful tool is the search function which you can use to find the relevant grant or program that you 're looking to apply for would like further information for so if you are simply just jumping on the website just looking to go through the job saver application you can simply type job save saver in there and it will take you directly to the page that you want to get to now if i was to go to the covert 19 page it will take you to a page that will provide both individual and business support one key feature that i 'll go over in just a brief moment is the covert 19 assistance finder as we scroll down the page you 'll find all the support and resources for the individual again if you require business support and would like a there for you you can click on the business support assistance available for businesses you 've got the additional support in regards to not just financial but mental health and also you can request a call back from a mobile business sorry from a business concierge however as spoken about before they are um due to

concierge they will call you they are going through each request and ensuring that um whoever has the um requests we 'll get a call back regardless now if we scroll down to the covered 19 assistance finder it is a two-minute questionnaire that you can fill out and what it will do is identify what type of assistance is there is out there for you for your individual and business needs so i 'm going

give you a call back on the number that you 've provided any additional questions i 'm happy to answer within the q a but thank you mike thanks uh matthew and i 'm glad you mentioned mental health as as well although we 've been talking about some of the financial support i think when you run a business and i 've run a business it 's not um it 's not just something that you know pays pays for your your food and your rent or your mortgage but it 's something you put your life into quite literally sometimes your blood sweat and tears so this is very distressing um to yeah there is support out there and i think it 's important to mention that um yeah a lot of people are struggling uh with their with their mental health um i 'm gonna ask um the next two business owners just to very briefly introduce themselves because we 've got a heap of questions so um we 've got ceo ahmad trad from zari tax accountants and we 've also got director leah oystermeyer from collaborate so if i can ask you to be very briefly in terms of introducing your businesses and then we 'll move straight on to the questions ladies first please ladies first hey um i 'm leah i 'm a ownering director at collaborate see we are management consultants we 're based in henry bankstown so we 've been there for the past four years trying to help the businesses of canterbury bankstown area um we are strategists so we try and help people businesses people grow their business um and i think the asset we 've been called on by willie and the chamber to help people that need help navigating all of quite complicated for us so i can only imagine how complicated it is for everybody else um so we 've been working with a lot of chamber members who you know need help getting their financial accounts up to date to see if they 're eligible um we 're doing that as part of our giving back to the community on the provision that we get paid you know if the grants go through and um you know you don 't put extra pressure on people um at this time okay over to me um g 'day_''_3142.559 good morning everyone uh i 'm at the trad here from azari so thank you to everyone that 's joined in today a bit about zarya and what we do we 're essentially a a multi-faceted uh professional services provider we 've grown up in in our own family business and we 've seen a lot of i guess pain points in growing and that 's been part of the building blocks for what we 've built so we 've essentially got a an accounting firm where we help clients with the very also got a a few other things that we bolted on in terms of professional services we have a law firm a business advisory firm we do technology and all things digital in that regard and it 's essentially a one-stop shop for meeting all those essential needs for you to be in business growing business and survive business especially in nowadays like leah said where we are working with many chamber members as well helping to assist them and guide them through these very very difficult times that we 'll going through there 's a lot of questions that i 'm seeing coming through the chat so guys keep it going um that 's what it 's all about we may not be able to get to every single question but we will try to to answer because there 's quite a few repeat um topics there that we 'll we 'll definitely get to and uh and hopefully give you as much guidance as possible so thank you thanks so much thank you very much um okay so what i i might do is i might ask um put their videos on i 'm not sure who the questions are going to be relevant to so i 'll just leave it to you guys to to answer as you feel um fit so i 'm just gonna have a look at the questions so we do have um we do have a number of questions some of the questions have been collected together which is great um just as a as a point uh related to a couple of the questions yes we will be sharing the slides from today so whatever email address you registered to be on this webinar then we 'll send that information to you um okay so question people who are on a working visa how can they access support uh i might take that one for now anyway and if anyone else has anything to say but people on a working visa should be contacting services australia to see if they can access any type of disaster payments you know i 'm working for the new south wales government obviously so i 'm not fully across what type of assistance is available be the starting place to try and find out what support is available um the next three questions are definitely for service new south wales for marty so um service new south wales so how many applications are you going through per day uh application so unfortunately i 'm not part of the application uh assessing those applications it 's a very uh look i know each application has special uh different circumstances so it 's increasingly it can it can vary from day to day um purely based on the information that has been provided so there 's alternative circumstances uh for many of these applications um so again i 'll have to come back to the group in regards to how many application on average they 're going through a day but what i can say is they they 're working day and night into in trying to get those applications finalized okay um i 'm not sure you 'll be able to answer this question and how many days on average does it take to process an application yeah so look um again it 's it is um now with the application process they 're trying to reduce the times of those applications getting completed i don 't have a certain answer in regards to how quick um those applications are getting approved but what i can do is some share some insights through an email in regards to how quick um and how long it should be taking for those applications to be fine mike um my name is joe i 'm also a management consultant at collaborate along with leia lee is leading this because she 's head of our finance and accounting team um we can say what we 're experiencing in regards to applications so if we think about applications that are inside the box um we 've had some of our clients get answers within three to five days um and some of them have already got some of um access some of those supports i 'm just saying that if they were eligible for the fifteen thousand dollar grant and only received ten and a half but we 're not sure what to tell them about the rest of the money so and but in regards to the job saver have we had any success in regards to that yet no we haven 't even been able to be put put in a position to apply and i also saw in some of the questions in here from i think i think the same ones from fazler rahman dan michelle um a lot of people and our clients as well we 've been in like we created a list of another 20 or 30 people who applied for the disaster that maybe should have waited for um the the next announcements but a lot of those industries that jumped in to get the disaster payment first from our client base we 're in their hair beauty and gym businesses and they 're often paid um week to week so you know when when i think the announcement was done on a thursday a lot of the money for beauticians and hairdressers is made on a thursday night late night shopping friday and saturday um so naturally when that money didn 't come through and they went into lockdown they went for i think that you know in regards to timing how long does it take i think some people that are inside the box they might be getting processed quickly but they 're not quite getting what they 're expecting and i think that a lot of our clients are delaying during job saver because they 're not sure if they apply for something what they might be ineligible for next so i think you 've asked um some of the questions that were there that we 're going to go through so um is there matthew or andrew did you want to at this point just respond to any of those before yes i asked some of the other questions yeah certainly so i 'll jump in in regards to uh the application so um very uh correctly um some applications are going through quite quickly um a lot of businesses are seeing uh money in their bank within three to five business days um and those applications have been worked through very quickly there are applications that have certain circumstances that are taking a little bit longer for those the question for the they 've been paid the 10 and a half and the and they still haven 't received the four and a half if you can send me an email offline we can take a look at those okay um this is a really important question because we 're such a multicultural um community within canterbury bankstown the website that you 've um you 've gone through i guess for both of you particularly but particularly the new south wales one with the brands is that translated to any other languages yeah so we do offer translation there is a option uh on the service new south wales to have a look at the website in different languages however we 're happy to take any additional feedback um that may come through okay um just a point some some of the questions relate to some of the restrictions at the moment we can 't really talk about those we 're not um we 're not qualified really to talk about any changes in restrictions so we won 't be able to answer those questions unfortunately another question the business to get the required support um i guess this is um both to you um andrew and to matthew yeah i 'll jump in um in regards to the application process so one thing we have really um put emphasis on is getting the business owner to register for the business profile and the reason for that is a number of grants and programs do come available not just grants but that business profile is like it 's dedicated for the business so it is a better alternative to have the the person that is associated whether the ceo director or sole trader having that direct access to that profile and managing that profile especially when it comes down to assessing when when they go through those uh assessments um it does make it very clear on the business that we 're dealing with um so there are a lot of checks and balances that do happen in the back end just to ensure the reduction of fraud and so forth that takes place but moving forward in regards to providing consistent updates not just about grants and trader or director or whoever may look after that that business to register and then if they do require those additional documents we 're happy to include those accounts within the application process if required okay because um i can i can see that there is a level of complexity and for some people um they they would want their accountant to probably understand things a bit more to sort of act on their behalf so you 're saying that that is possible yeah certainly so um when if there is additional additional requirements in regards to their application the um the assessor will send an email in regards to additional documentation requirements and i 'll try and clearly stipulate what is required one other thing that we have added to the application process is we 've provided a template for accountants to fill out just to make that that process a lot easier okay just just one point sorry there matthew if we can maybe expand upon that i think will be of great value to all those attending with us is perhaps some of some of the known viewpoint is uh when preparing these applications be as thorough and as concise as possible don 't try and do it too shorthand because if you do it inevitably results in delay but from your end like seeing well hopefully i 'm not sure what sort of insight you 've got um internally but is there something that you could perhaps shed some light on to to assist those that yet haven 't lodged or are still thinking of getting the the applications together in terms of uh the level of detail and and the lengths to go through just to ensure a faster turnaround yeah certainly so um i look at it as a point of view so if i i know for an assessor 's point of view is that we want to make it the more you can document and provide um a clear picture for the assessor again they 're going through each document they 're reviewing your case so ensuring that you have provided everything outlined in the got in the guidelines now the guidelines we 've tried to simplify as much as possible in are required for your application so again if if you are for example applying for alternative circumstances um and you 're putting your application forward provide as much detail so there 's never going to be an issue um providing too much detail um the more detail you put in and within your application the clearer picture it makes for the assessor to go through through your application um can you apply for alternative circumstances or through services new south wales online so it kind of makes you answer questions that are not quite right you know i waited on hold the first time i waited for three hours for them to just say yes and give their supporting evidence at the end even though my answer should have been no at the beginning yeah so with the within the application it does ask you some uh questions in regards to comparison periods for 2019 when you go through the application all that we ask is that you answer the application truthfully when you answer the application truthfully it will ask you additional questions in regards to your alternative circumstances proceed any further it is best to speak to us before you do so that way that 's what i did yeah yeah because i said it was your turnover for 2020 over 75 000. if you say no you can 't continue but if you only traded for part of the year it 'll be an alternative circumstance so technically it would have been over 75 000. but it 's still pro writer you just have to and then you provide your bars and things like that but it just makes you say yes to an answer that should be no just to move forward yeah i 'll take that feedback um on and pass it over to our product teams but they are working through that application process again we 're trying to make it as easy as possible for our local businesses to go through the application process and we 're trying to filter that feedback through to our product team so again if you if you do have feedback that you do want to pass on yeah i think i think holistically with the with the a a very i guess narrow path of you just fit into the standard criteria then you get the result if you have these alternative routes that are there are an option you 're going to have to go through the entire journey before that 's even revealed and i think that 's going back to what lea is saying if that needs to be incorporated at the early stages yeah go through especially with whole times of you know three to four hours and we you know we we 've been hearing and and and feeling the grunt of it from from various clients as well that you know it 's very frustrating to to be on on the phone for so long yeah yeah i think especially when it gets disconnected and then they just end up in tears i can 't believe i just cried because the call got disconnected so guys i 'm gonna i 'm just gonna jump in there because they had some really sort of we 're going into too much detail um there so i 'm going to move on with um thank you there 's some good um practical things there and i think some feedback to new south wales i do think new south wales are doing their best and i really believe they 're probably they are literally working um morning day night at the moment to get through this um and it 's it 's frustrating when things don 't happen quickly but i 'm sure they 're doing their best one of the questions that 's coming up a lot is um in relation to the um disaster payment so if someone 's applied for the disaster payment can they withdraw and then apply for the business grant because they can 't apply for both look uh i 'm not entirely sure about how that works with services australia and whether or not you can you can pay it back essentially what we 'd suggest in those circumstances is obviously try and reach out to services australia have a chat with them see if there are circumstances where you can pay it back um we certainly do appreciate it it is difficult that the way that these guidelines have potentially changed and you 've been eligible for something or you weren 't eligible previously and you 're now eligible so you applied for different things and now it 's made you totally ineligible if you 've received a disaster payment so we 're currently kind of working through what those situations are and any feedback that we get from this call is certainly important there yeah so we understand like disaster is center length so that 's federal yeah um and in the way that worked was for someone who lost more than 20 hours um it was 500 week 1 500 week to um 600 week three 750 week four and now they 're aligned yeah with the market for the state yeah which for someone um had they and the state would have backdated it so that 's a loss of that 's a micro grant yeah yeah so that 's a loss of 650 dollars per week over four weeks by not switching out but really what that would be you know for uh like refunding it 's not necessarily for our clients it know the difference the six like or just give you now the the difference of 650 yeah yeah yeah because i 'll also add um because we 're a female founder business and a lot of the businesses that were in the most dire straits were the uh week to week tradies like hairdressers beauticians personal trainers from gyms etc that 's a lot of female businesses and entrepreneurs that are 650 out in a week-to-week type of um life yes look certainly um if that i mean it is a tough situation uh that 's currently what is in the guidelines we 're working with the government with the commonwealth to try and work out what we can do to i guess streamline that process um looking backwards as well because like you say you know if you applied for just the first week 's worth of disaster payment your agreement you 're ruled out of applying for the micro grants at all so you know the course of that you could lose over the course of you know four weeks of less payments it could you know the i think the people that jumped on to the disaster payment so quickly was that desperate so if we think it they are potentially as far small businesses go the most vulnerable of small business owners that they jumped on within one day of knowing that because they couldn 't put food on their tables or they couldn 't pay their rent or their sell on or you know rent like commercial and home mortgages and things like that um that they were probably the most desperate opposed to those that had some savings and thought yeah wait a minute i 'm going to jump back in there sorry leah and so your colleagues i think there 's some really specific questions that you 've got about your clients and what you 've experienced that maybe you could address with andrew and matthew letter just so that we can get through all of the questions um so the next um the next question and i 'm sorry i have to um rush through this so trying to get to as many questions as possible can my clients go back after have their records in order and can they apply retrospectively for assistance so let 's take that one to start and match if you 've got anything else to add you can start at this stage i don 't believe you can apply um after the cut-off date for the cut-off date for the business grants is currently the 13th of september and for the job saver and the micro business grants it 's the 18th of october now it 's important to remember so if you do apply for the business grant before the 13th of september you you know it 's for those first three weeks of the lockdown and for you know if you apply for the micro grants on the 17th of october for example you would receive the full payment of the micro grants so it is retrospective in that sense did you have anything to add matt no i think you 've hit it straight on okay how can the government extend support this is one that 's come up a lot as well um in terms of newly started businesses those who have know maybe in the last few months couple of months um what what supports available to them yeah look i 'll i 'll take that one as well because it 's certainly something that we 're hearing a lot in a lot of sessions and we 're getting a lot of correspondence from from business owners and from service new south wales about this type of the situation so it is something that 's currently being reviewed particularly in terms of the comparison period having to use 2019 for example to to compare to and that 's obviously not possible if you 're a new business so as i think leah pointed out earlier there are some alternative circumstances but we 're currently looking into you know whether or not those alternative circumstances could be applied more broadly and whether or not businesses would be able to use a comparison period that hits their circumstances a bit more appropriately particularly with this this would obviously apply to new businesses so i mean the the key things i guess with new businesses those that have started in the last 12 to to show that the annual turnover is over 75 000 um and they will typically do that by annualizing out a business activity statement so if it 's a quarterly statement times something to turn over by four and then the second thing as i mentioned is comparing the is having a the correct alternative comparison period um so if it 's a new business for example you may be able to compare the period of the lockdown to a period within the first three quarters of the 20 20 21 financial year so for example you could compare the 26th of june uh the fortnight of the 26th of june to the 10th of july with a fortnight in february 2021 before the lockdown now generally with this comparison period you need to provide a letter from an account that kind of certifies that and i i believe the letters from accounts the templates on the website are currently being updated to show um when there is alternative circumstances uh what the comparison periods could be um but as i said we are hearing you feedback a lot in other businesses i thought there was a question about someone that had i think lumpy turnover in the chat same kind of same kind of situation we 're looking at what what those type of businesses can do in those situations so um i guess the the key point is you know it 's currently in progress uh the work is ongoing and we 're trying to develop something that we think will will hopefully work for everyone so keep your eyes keep your eyes on the service new south wales website for updates there okay listen next question i 'm not sure that any of you sort of spoke about this i think it 's more federal issue um ahmed you might have something to say on this or matthew or andrew um payroll tax support is there anything available for businesses in that sense uh there is mike and i i did touch on this one in my uh presentation earlier and in the complex is a state-based issue yeah and in the the slides that went out the slides that we 'll be going out there 's are offering uh payroll tax referrals and they 're also offering uh i believe it 's 25 just checking my notes here 25 waiver on your 2021 20 21 22 payroll tax um if you 've experienced a 30 declining turnover okay um there 's a question here continues will you consider increasing the waiver amount higher than 25 percent because if at the moment we 're going to look down until the end of august if this continues into september cash flow is going to be even harder possibly i mean it 's certainly if this does continue um which i 'm sure we all hope it doesn 't but if it does continue we 'll have to re-evaluate i mean the whole range of support that we 've got and what that looks like moving forward so and i believe payroll tax will be considered as part of that okay there 's a question about micro businesses about briefly explaining that i think the questions may be around the definition of micro businesses are you talking about businesses with maybe up to five employees that 's generally micro businesses for the purposes of these grants and i know it 's not the same definition that might be used in different uh different areas but we we 've looked at it as those with below it with a turnover below 75 000. so we know from our experience last year we had several grants that were only available to businesses with a turnover above 75 000. we heard a lot of feedback saying that that excluded smaller businesses that were in desperate need for assistance as well so this year we 've provided something for that kind of middle category of businesses that you know you still get your primary income from the business but um you 're not quite over the gst threshold of 75 000. so we 've defined micro businesses as those between with a turnover between 30 000 and 75 000. okay all right i 'm just gonna switch um ask wally i 'm gonna ask you a question if there 's um any sort of standout issues that your members um are sort of raising with you that you might want to ask either impact that businesses are going through has superseded and exceeded the amount of support receiving from the government so this is the um the question back to the government what you 're offering from support is a drop in the ocean i think the call here and the uh the agony that 's taken place the government needs to reconsider the amount of support available or the percentage support available what do you say andrew and matthew um look thanks for that feedback wally um at this stage look we understand that it is you know this is not that this support is not going to compensate businesses so they lost revenue it 's just i guess at this point the purpose of this support is to provide some sort of immediate cash flow relief or not necessarily immediate but some sort of cash flow cash flow relief so that businesses can just survive um look good feedback going we can certainly pass it on um in terms of the value of support just not not really making a difference and i did say there was a question in the you 've lost 250 grand over the course of a month what 's that going to make that 's not really going to make a big a a drop in the ocean in effect but it is also so it 's not just the business grant you can also receive you know job favor payments which uh 40 of your payroll if you 've got quite a large payroll you know that amount could be up to a hundred thousand dollars a week so the the level of support is tailored based on your your business size um or your business payroll so hopefully in that sense there is some level of i guess support for for the cash flow expenses but yes in any case we certainly pack that fee back on board thankfully i think just touching back though with with support you know there 's two layers to it there 's one which is the cash grants the other is relief i think for a lot of the employing businesses increasing the amount of relief with the payroll tax will go a long way so look ideally be taxing a business just for employing people and putting food on their table so that 's one of those taxes that will just unfortunately you know be always hard to swallow in any business especially as they 're growing so ideally just abolish it get rid of it but at the same time the new south wales government needs to raise money from somewhere so i think given the fact that we 're going through such an extremity with these measures you know even even going as far as doing 100 relief during these difficult times will go a long way to help these businesses so that 's something that we 'd definitely be advocating for yeah um can i just say with the micro business grants because i think there 's still questions coming through about that if there is alternative circumstances for businesses that just started so if you can 't show a turnover of more than 30 000 because you 're a new business you can use alternative tests but it 's probably get best to get advice from an accountant to to claim that but rule you out just because you can 't show a turnover of thirty thousand between thirty thousand and seventy five thousand in that year yeah thanks for that yeah i just i also wanna come back to your point there um on the on different types of release that 's offered i mean i didn 't go into it but we the the government is also i think was announced in the last last year 's budget or the budget at the start of the year we 've got a 1500 voucher i know that 's also you know a relative drop in the ocean but it does provide some sort of relief for new south wales government and i think it 's also available for council fees and charges so there is there is a bit of a rebate there to cover some expenses but it 's not a great amount i appreciate that yeah in regards to 1500 um i think that also extends to car regions for the portion of vehicles that are used for business purposes yeah there 's a lot of our clients where they pay my you know i 'm not or i 'm an electrician um so can i get it yes you can as an electrician but if you 're not an electrician for example and not pay state fees and then rejoice one of those things so that 's um they 've been happy with receiving a little bit of something so that was good so thank you that 's good feedback just um just to add to that matthew and andrew are you just able to give us a quick a quick rundown synopsis of the exact payments or expenses that grants can be used are we looking at surmising right now uh yeah in terms of what the actual grants can be used for what expenses can they be used to cover i was in the the business grants or the the 1500 free page um the business grants so the business grants so the micro grant business grant job saver they can all be used to cover you know a range of business expenses uh if you 're a director or a partnership or a sole trader and pay your your wages or your salaries um for yourself you can also use it to pay utilities expenses insurance expenses uh your rent if you 're unable to save you know rent reduction from your landlord uh you can use it to pay for an accountant or to get some financial or legal advice so there 's kind of a broad range of business expenses that you can use the grants on and in terms of the 1500 rebate that 's specifically for new south wales government and local council fees and charges so council rates event fees with the licenses food authority licenses and things like that yeah and just on that as well through the service new south wales website we 've actually provided an extensive list on what you can actually apply for that rebate on so you can find that through if you need a quick search um jump onto the service new south wales website in the search bar type in 1500 and it will provide you further details in relation to what they could be used for yeah i think michelle there she you can pay um you can pay wages so i think it might actually lead into the next part of closely held employees i think um if michelle might be maybe not on payroll so she 's worried that it 's not wages per se but it would be directors drawings maybe but um lea has probably got some questions around closely held in regards to the job saver subsidy okay i think with job saver because it 's based on the last bars lodged with the ato so if you 're an owner or director of a company and you only pay yourself like a bulk of your income in june that won 't be covered as part of your 40 rebate for job saver is that right yeah as far as i understand that 's right so maybe that 's something that we can take off to take offline and thanks for that feedback layer um it 's not i think um i mean there 's a whole lot of questions we haven 't answered and i think there 's um you know there 's an opportunity for participants i do see um that since as we 've been answering questions the number of participants have been dropping off that 's i don 't think that 's through lack of interest and there 's still quite a number still on but i think we made a commitment to finish at 11 30 and um we will finish um so what i 'd like to say is um actually before i thank the speakers there 's um a little team in the background that sort of been making all this happen technically and field in some of the questions and throwing them to me so um you won 't see them but i think i should name them because they 've done an important job so that susie and sam and martha and michelle in the background i 'd like to thank them from from council who 've been supporting this um from um service new south wales matthew thank you for um what you 've said today i think you 've been very clear um i know that you 're under the pump and a lot of people that it 's not directed personally at you and i think um you know we 'll we 'll get through this um and do the same um with uh with treasury thanks um for the information that you 've presented um today and i thank you for your ongoing support because i know that you can be involved in answering some of the questions we haven 't been able to get to today um ahmed and leah um and sorry i forgot your colleagues guys no joe i just didn 't um so apologies joe celia and joe and ahmed um

    "text": "hi everyone my name is maria you may remember me from the morning classes of pump and yoga i 'm really excited to be here and doing this today for you today 's demonstration is about a push-up your favorite exercise and mine and given that we have a push-up challenge coming up i know that for you this is going to be very beneficial so first of all thank you so very much for making the time to be here with me to watch this demonstration this is going to be a little bit technical but i i do hope to break it down for you give you some options that will be at a level that you may feel comfortable and a little bit you want may want to challenge yourself but with any exercise please remember that really you need to use some common sense listen to your body because this is really um we don 't know you we don 't know your situation so if it doesn 't feel good the rule is you just don 't do it and obviously when you 're working you 've got clear space around you to work in safely lighting if you 're working inside a mat or something that you 're going to be comfortable in town it 's important to stay hydrated we need to make sure that you look after you and today my workout is going to be very much explaining what the push-up is all about i mean why do a push-up who wants to do a push-up a push-up is an absolutely functional multi-functional exercise it works seventy percent of your body uh at least on a lot of the major and minor muscles it is a strength it is a coordination it is an ability it is a power exercise that you can do it for many many purposes as a warm up as a cool down as part of your conditioning and as part of any type of workout and really it 's all about where you are with your push-up now i 'm going to go through a couple of options for you there are countless ways to do a push-up and in this demonstration today we don 't through what is turned a military push-up or the very standard push-up that you see a lot of and basically it means that we 're going to have our hands in a certain position in our feet and position so come down with me to the floor so now i 'm going to turn on to the side so you can see what i 'm doing so first of all we want to make sure that our knees are about hip width apart okay so they 're your hip width apart this is my hip width apart okay i 'm going to make sure that our shoulders are sitting back well away from our ears because we want that scapular engaged because once your scapula is engaged that means that your body will know to send that message to the brain to engage your abdominals it 's kind of like two for the price of one so coming down to the floor our first option and this is kind of like a beginner level if you 're not sure where to go or maybe if you 're pregnant as well much wider than our shoulders now if i lift my hands up the mexican way you will see that my elbow is lined up with my shoulders and my palms are facing you and my fingers are spread out that is ideally where you would want your hand and arm position to be when you are starting your push-up okay so back to the side come with me back down to the floor my hands are wide on my shoulders my knees are hip width apart i 've got a nice long spine and i 'm looking at my imaginary clock in front of me that says 12 o 'clock it 's not lunchtime so stay with me so here is my imaginary pocket 12 clock i 've got a long spine if i put my cappuccino on my back it won 't spill and let me tell you you don 't want my coffee to spill so my coffee is on my back my abdominals are engaged and now what i 'm going to simply do is take my nose to the floor and straight back up so that the front nothing 's changed with my position nose towards the floor and straight back up and you will see that as i come down to the floor my elbow is below my shoulder and i 'll tell you why that is like that you have any shoulder concerns any kind of twitches or twinges keep that elbow either a little bit higher or parallel if you want to go a little bit deeper and make that push up harder then you drop that elbow let me show you come back down to the floor so we have our hands wider than our shoulders so i want to go a little bit easier today because i 'm not feeling very well and there 's my option but i 'm thinking no i do feel pretty good i want to work a little bit harder then i take it a little bit deeper and that 's the beauty about a push-up you can make it as easy or as hard as you want to so that 's kind of like a base level push-up but i know that you do want going to show you how you can do that let 's go to level two back down to the floor with me so if we take the mexican wave hands okay elbow lined up with my shoulder palms facing forward fingers spread out i 'm going to take my hands straight down to the floor and then i 'm going to slide my feet straight back my feet stay on the floor and i 'll explain why in a minute and i 'm going to drop straight down to the floor and then straight back up did you see that come with me onto the side next and wave hands nice strong straight back eyes looking ahead abdominals engaged drop my hands to the floor eyes at 12 o 'clock slide my knees back my bed on the floor nose to the ball straight back up step in wrap yourself up if you need to so that 's a little bit more advanced now you notice that on both of those push-up options my feet are on the floor and i 'll tell you why as soon as we lift actually hyper extend our back now what that means is that our back will dip and that 's not good for you we want our back in a neutral spine when our back dips in a push-up position our core muscles cannot engage safely which means you 're not really working your abdominals so we want to make sure that by eliminating to eliminate that issue we put our feet on the floor your abdominals are engaged your back is safe you 're looking good option three i know you want to do this one tell me extra four mexican way of hands here we go remember the first one second one i know you 've been waiting for this third one walk my hands in step up i don 't get excited don 't go to 100 yet but let 's do one more so you can see from the front what it looks like mexican wave hands come down to the knees drop my hands to the floor slide my feet back onto the toes nose to the floor step it in tuck the slip up if you push up for more fours push up from the knees and push up from the toes which one do you do when well that really depends on you how you feel how much time you have and what your workout is all about however what is important that in every type of recovery it 's possible include some form of strength training remember the push-up works your triceps your chest back extensor muscles abdominals as well as the deeper abdominal muscles that we don 't see from the outside but we know they 're there it can help to strengthen your pelvic floor remember to turn it on help to strengthen your glutes your glutes strong glutes help to support your back and one more thing that 's really really important please breathe breathe through those movements when you breathe your body uses that oxygen to supply it to your muscles so that you stay safe well i hope this demonstration today has been of benefit to you i 'm very grateful for this opportunity to present it to you i really am looking forward to teaching pastors back at an amazing amazing day thank you _"

    "text": "hi everybody it 's megan from canterbury bankstown leisure in aquatics today i 'm going to show you some boxing technique uh going through our stance where we place our arms nice strong core for most of those boxing even a little bit of padding and how we 've had when we 're in a boxing class so that for those of you who may be familiar unfamiliar sorry with a boxing class don 't feel intimidated to get in there get in and give it a go hopefully the skills that you might learn today just on stance will let you feel comfortable enough to get in there and all for those who just want to touch up on some of their skills so before we proceed any further please make sure if you are feeling unwell or if you have any injuries as always we want to look after our bodies before we can get back into an actual boxing class so please make sure you 're training with care don 't overdo it don 't feel like you 're pressuring yourself to your body to do anything up and have a look at some of those moves so first of all um we 've got our southpaw or orthodox so southpaw is for the lefties which would be your left side dominant uh orthodox would be for your right side dominant people doesn 't necessarily mean that left-handed people are going to be southpaws speaking for myself i 'm a lefty but i have a strong side dominant for boxing so i 'll just give you the the idea of your boxing stance so if for example we 're going to go orthodox so right side dominant we 're going to have our left foot in front so it 's opposite if you 're a south paw and your left side is your strong side you will have your left foot back but for this example we 'll go orthodox so right side dominant rights my strong side i 've got my left foot in front both feet facing forward and i 'm nice and evenly balanced weights not necessarily leaning on that front leg or on the back leg nice and evenly balanced between both legs square okay so ox always got our arms up for our boxing our jab is going to be our weak arm okay so our jab comes out in front our cross is our strong side when we go into that cross you want to make sure boxing 's not just arms it 's whole body okay so we 've got our jab cross driving straight out into that punch jab cross jab cross so i 'm not just moving my arms i 'm working my whole body i 'm getting a lot of power from my glute while my hip driving through and my back foot pivoting on the ground okay so jab driving that arm out across cross jab cross okay drive that think about punching from the hip bringing that hip into the punch jab cross jab cross you 'll get a lot more power pivoting on that back foot and snapping the hip through okay nice strong call the whole time all right we 've got our jab cross so i 'm boxing right now as an orthodox my jab is my left my weak arm you your weak arm jab cross driving through that punch okay moving into our our hooks for example okay with our hooks we want to make sure our arms at 90 degrees we 've got a 90 degree angle you don 't want to swing out and open up too wide okay you 'll only hurt the shoulder or the elbow even the wrists okay also with our wrist i didn 't mention nice loose grip okay try not to squeeze too tight it 'll be hard to do also try and relax the shoulders all right relaxing those shoulders are always nice and loose without boxing and our padding all right so jab cross for example hook hook keeping our hooks below our shoulders we don 't want to be hooking up above the head okay we don 't want to get any injuries keeping a nice strong core again i 'm pivoting all right pop that front hip forward across driving that hip through pivoting on the back foot same with our uppercuts okay we 've got a nice strong punch driving up the center 90 degrees try not hit the wrist or the pad with your wrists like this you want to come underneath the pad which will be coming down on top up the center 90 degrees so these are our uppercuts okay sometimes you might also have fast unders okay the difference between our unders is a nice fast little cardio punches and our uppercuts uppercuts and hooks are our power punch all right so we 've got our unders and our uppercuts okay big difference between those two punches alright so we 've got our jab cross jab cross okay so we 've gone through our jab crosses we 've got our hooks keeping our arm 90 degrees try and keep your wrist or your um wrist switched on okay so we want to have our wrist this way just switch on those forearm muscles to protect the wrists and elbow all right we 've got our hooks and put our uppercuts good uppercuts probably just underneath the chin um the whole time we 're keeping a nice strong core and remember it 's not just arms all right also with our punches having a 'm losing half my power because with my back foot not pivoting and my back heel up not up in the air sorry i 'm not getting that glute power okay so i 'm not i 'm not able to drive through the punch no matter how hard i try as soon as i add that pivot and the back foot i get a lot more power um another thing i just want to give you a quick idea about boxing is one thing to learn if you 're new to a boxing class padding can seem even more daunting so just think you 're still boxing i think you 're still boxing okay so you 're nice and loose you 've got your boxing stance that mirror image is your your whoever 's boxing so if your boxer is the southpaw even if you 're a righty you 'll have to switch over and match them okay so your feet if they 've got their left foot in front you think that 's fine you 'll have your left foot in front so your mirror image so between you floor all right um and padding nice and light nice and loose through the shoulders jab cross jab cross think 80 20. boxer goes 80 of the way pad goes 20. all right you don 't want to stand still like this getting hit okay nice and loose shoulders strong core 20 all right you 're still meeting them 20. don 't go all the way don 't go 80 so they 've only got to go like this all right you want to go 20 you 're nice and relaxed you 've got your boxing stance nice strong core you 're ready to take those punches standing still or flat stance and just taking those punches you could risk getting an injury um and if you 've ever if you 've ever boxed to someone that 's holding still you 'll know it 's not that same feeling back so just think relax the shoulders nice strong core you 're moving with your boxer as a powder all right so you 've got your boxing moves all right and you 've got your padding very similar hooks coming around tucked in you don 't want to hold them out here like this keep them nice and protected nice strong core and then you 've got your uppercuts coming down on top again not holding them right up here where you could kind of get your arm thrown back if they 've got a nice strong punch all right by you making them 20 of the way you 're protecting your shoulder you 're protecting your body boxes enjoying it a lot more and yeah you 'll have a lot more fun so i hope you 've enjoyed it hope it 's cleared a few things up for you and i 'll see you there in the next boxing class when we can bye you _"

way over to europe north america back to europe before coming back to australia and really settling there to forward my music career in the sort of neighbor 's backyard so to speak uh and so this song

might recognize some of the some of the spots anyway it 's on the facebook if you 'd like to check it out but um the song itself is it 's a pretty stripped back number and uh kind of that southern gothic americana sound was was what we were going for on this one and it 's ended up resonating with a few of our fans who who think it 's one of the one a lot which i was surprised because [Music] as i said it 's a little um a little more introspective but i 'll see what you think [Music] get on the train [Music] do not take one minute do not stop and turn do not wait do not blow me kiss my darling sweet [Music] get on the train let it take you home into the night do not dream of me do not write not for one second thing of coming back i 'm gonna walk home darling take whatever i 'll let

    "text": "[Music] back for another lesson lesson number 27 27 27 close at 11 with a man named bevan levin i that brings me white tails because bearing be the name of the captain after i first learned under some of you followers have been saying to me some of you young priority trainees have been saying captain we know you know you weren 't born a pirate you didn 't come out with a patch and a pirate from your boat was you know when you were born no no it 's not true it 's not true you didn 't get more than a pirate first you 're a sailor where did you learn to sail i say hi will that be me captain baron which brings us back to 27. isn 't it funny how these things all work out but no when i was young lad right i learned to say i learned all the tricks of the trade of the sailor side you know from captain bevin right and the good ship the pre-king the peking now the pre-king what is a huge four master bark right that be the peking you see that four moss there see that for us all right got the foxhole marks there right right hey the main marst same as me then it 's got this other one that 's called the missing moss right partly because on the beach it 's just missing now it 's a missing marsh like that right there and the digger mask at the back there right so that foremost right huge big vessel happy right it had 32 sails 32. ah you had to know all of them right all of them 32 for sales and i 'd be paying powered by sale alone a huge big ship right the ship itself weighed five tons five thousand tons right forty thousand tons plus you 'd be carrying three thousand ton right right that 's 8 000 tons you 're pushing through the water used to get up to 16 17 knots under sail right the water will be churning out the back but no motor no motor be all done with sail and the power of our office and our hands and the so we had to learn how to sail it right that 's how we did it remember i told you about the dog come out and nippy pretty wrong that 's where i learned that trick from was captain beveren on the peaking right he had his train dog he used to track us around right the boats didn 't have us running around all the ropes he yelled out in the name of the rope and we 'd have to run over there and do it and then grab that rope and we 'd rather although that 's how he didn 't we do all that right there were like 350 ropes right we call them loins 350 loins on that right they had to learn by learning your lines we like being in one of them big plays right but now 350 we had to learn hitting the ball so they 'd chase us around we 'd all be doing a double toy run around that dog would be nipping if he did the wrong thing right boston every now and then to get a bit toying give away like i do sometimes you don 't pan away by the way so all you would do then he 'd pick a line that was all up in the rigging so we had to get up the rat lines room with them right up the right line there and touch the rope because you had to touch the rope before you didn 't come back down right and that 's how you learn all that kind of stuff you run around and that was all that right kind of thing and that 's what we used to do we sail this huge ship right and where the sail this ship was a big strong ship right it was built to sail around the horn right sail around the horn right ah and that 's what we did in this ship we sailed around the horn now cape horn right you might not know what keyboard is right if you look at the map right or a global right it 's got australia there in the middle right and on each side of it the big continents come down and keep a good oaks over in africa so right a cape owns the bottom of chile right and that 's how we 'd say along right we 'd sail over there and go around the tape right and go underneath and we go around the tree right that 's how you get around the bottom right all right well i 've talked about that before and i 'll go on a bit more later on but a big ship like this right you 'd have everything on it right this is why it 's such a good ship to learn on right because i 've gone upstairs and having so much learning even smaller ropes you ever need like so many more ropes than i need on the beaches and i 've been teaching you right now so filming loins and all that kind of stuff and sales and all those things you had to learn about which ones are which right so much more to learn right so you learn a big way and we went because we went around the hall and that 's the hardest sailing you big goal intensive course it was an intensive cause right and what also happened right on this ship is it 'd just go port to port right it wouldn 't really stop in between where these big ones could have a big cargo type car and ships right you just we 're going from port to port so and that 's lots and lots of days like 92 days of sailing it took us in the trip that i went on right to get around right from up up up in belgium right all the way down underneath cape horn and up into chile up the top of the chili no one of their poor trading ports up there right in san diego up that way okay so they do that okay so we do that right so what to have on there they 'd have sales and everything everything you needed to have on that ship would be on the ship right so we 'd be making sales and repair and things like that so every day we do have four hour shifts you come up to do another guy would go and help on the wheel and the other of us will get a job so we work with the blacksmith all the same maker and all that kind of time you 're making your sales and doing everything like that kind of stuff and you get things all ready along so you 're making the sales nice and tight and good sales right cause you the old sales you could use put up when the doldrums and stuff like that are on when you 're still doing no wind and all that stuff but when you 're in the horn you want your best stuff there so you make breath fresh stills they 're all strong and tight and ready to go right and you 'll be using tar right on their lines and stuff like that so they wouldn 't chafe you know when you get a bit of a rash there from the ropes and tails and that do the same thing they chafe and that 's what makes them weaker and all that kind of stuff like that so you try to avoid that and all that kind of stuff so part of the jobs that we do as we learn and what we 're doing on the ship right and so that 's what is the best way to learn right and other jobs we could do when you go fishing right remember we talked about the bell sprite remember the bow sprite the pointy bit at the front right you 've got the nets beside it right the nets beside it i 'm going to show it actually show it to you right so you 're actually hanging those nets right with a spear anyway fish to come underneath right and you jump down and try and spear them from down over above right to that if you get some fish straight and it 's odd because the light refracts in the oh and the water right so fish looks like it 's just there but it 's really over there right and you 've got to judge it and be used to it right the captain himself i know captain bevan right he was a master rally we 'd be there and all that kind of stuff we could do that one time right down there on the way through down line down there right we actually saw a 13-foot squid one time i mean amazing fish we saw a young fella who just stole your first flight down on the ship where you 're floating around there right amazing things to see all those kind of things that we had right you know right now one of the things you should know when you 're saying you learn about a sailor like that you know we talk about you know when you 're pulling up the rigging and a lot of stuff we talked about the seashells you know we 're talking about the seashells right and they were like yo whoa you notice when you 're doing that right you 're not just pull pull pulling right you 're jerking right it 's all about the jerk he said why why would you just jerk and not just pull all the time well a jerk is five times stronger than the pull right if you 're doing this long getting five times an hour right imagine a hammer right in your hammer and a nail this is a good analogy right for the whole thing right good part word analogy higher the good ship analogy ah oh who knows anyway right so hammer hammer nail right try getting a hammer and a nail and try pushing in the nail all right which is the same doesn 't really work does it right right that 's the same as if you pull it on a rope to raise the ceiling all that kind of stuff but if you get a hammer and you bag it bang it bang it it 's getting five times the energy it won 't go and that 's what drops drives it in right that 's the same as rooftop sales you go jerk jerk all right that 's how you do it that 's how you does it that 's why we jerk things in right and that 's why they sail the songs we sing in the shanties will work and songs are all done right that 's how you do it right things you learn and they 're the things they 'll be passing on to you as part of this whole training new york about a pirate school right so there is good important things that i learned on this one trip right other thing i learned right because we had a big storm on the way down right and us being novice sailors we didn 't realize how big these storms could get right you just took a sail and ship ships you know ships they float on top of the water that 's what you think right not true big storms the water is crashing all the things this is just a normal storm come up there normal big storm as we hit before we even got the horn where it 's really really bad right okay but we 're going down there i get a big storm and it actually picked up the whole anchor right three ton anchor and smashed it under the neck right 20 feet up smashed onto the deck oh we had it all rushed forward and hold it down and secure it and like that no because that 's how big and slurf gets and it was all that kind of stuff right all right so when we got to the horn right because we 're prepared for it there okay we actually had to lash down put up all the good sails all right all the strong sails lash down the ankle because he won 't be using that again until way around the other side right there 's nowhere to anchor there you just keep sailing keep sailing right and all the ropes are secure and everything 's ready to go so everything 's locked down you 're batting down the arches right you 're sealing off all the decks there so water when it rushes over doesn 't go underneath so that 's all the things are getting prepared right now now so we 're sailing around the corn right we 're coming from west east right because going from belgium right on down to the bottom and then back up again right okay now that 's the wrong way to go around the horn really right that 's the 's happening is and and he can 't just go around the pointy bit that 's straight back up again right because there 's all the shoals and rocks and little pointy bits and little islands and all that kind of stuff there the liquid oil is there ah i 've been the death of many a ship right there are you taking out many a ship right you actually have to go down right and then go 200 mile west before your turn to go back up again right so let 's take it on that and you 're sailing straight into the roar and 40s more or less straight in the road and 40s what are the roaring 40s_._614.0 you might have heard them right aurora and 40s right it 's like right with latitudes and longitudes talk about that there are in 40s or the 40 to the 50 latitude of the map right as you go right and there 's in that there 's a channel of wind huge wind just push straight across there right that 's why when they come over to australia and could sail quicker i know when they go into the 180s if they go down and actually just stay in the roar and 40s and go straight across rather than go up to the east indies along africa and all that kind of stuff actually quicker to just go straight across and then up because the rory 40s are just so strong and that 's if you 've ever been in one of them plenty things right and float to fly to perth right if you 're flying from sydney to perth okay it takes you five hours all right if you 're flying from perth to sydney it only takes about three and a half that 'd be the roar and 40s they 're on that that 's how much they affect it right in the plane as the same with the ship so we 're taking that ship right where it don 't want to go all right against the wind the ship don 't want to go that way nature don 't want us to go that way but we 're sailors so we make it go got to do so we are sailing into that wind and we 're having a good time right and it 's not like we got safety equipment or anything like that okay on the ship brain no safety equipment on there there 's no ropes to hold on to and all that kind of stuff nothing like that okay what they had right only safety kind of equipment little touch to safety right is i meant oh hns you got nowadays because we 'd have nets off the board right up the top there to catch the sailors if they washed over the sword like that we sort of called it like straining the sailors because you 'd be like peas if you recorded that and you got snailed you know i myself actually got done one time right because you have to you know you you just gotta be ready for the ways right there 'll be no safety the safety was you had to be aware right ready when the next well was coming and then you would grab old or something i 've got an example of one of the guys here right and you can see the water crashing across the deck that 's what it did on the whole i always swear about 20 feet of water over there like the bow spray the bow spray right normally that 's traveling the pointy bit right is that traveling 20 feet right above the water but at times going around the horn it 's like 20 feet under the water we 're going up and down and the water is crashing over and over and stuff right and you can see the fella there right what he 's done he 's just grabbing old you know where he 's coming so you grab all of one of the ropes right all the loins are there around the place and grab hold of that one right and you want to be on the windward side right so the wind 's coming this way so it bashes against you 're bashing against something you 're holding on there if you 're on the other side you 're going to get flapped all over the place and bashed around on the window it 's so heated but you can see the waves crashing across there are they all that 's the old peking just going around the horn you can see how much water is across the deck right that 's why you have to be aware right oh you 're myself right i 've been laughing about not paying attention right and i 've probably taken that photo and you know a rogue wave comes through and it hits me and just washes me off and just swept me straight off my feet right now and i 've ended up caught up in the nets there on the side right with strange like i said with about a half inch of going right over the side right and two of the beloiters do with the crew right they didn 't make it they went straight over they missed right they were over right then we went home with two empty bunks right never mentioned on ship line you know that 's the old tradition right somebody gets one those big things that happened at sea nobody talked about two empty bunks no more was said right we stay all back empty ship right it was a terrible little thing right now going around the horn the wrong way that 's a really hard thing to do hurry but this ship it be built for the whole of that right so it 's really strong i mean it was really strong but it was crazy as a young sailor because just the ropes themselves the loins right the loins of the ship you see the loins of the ship and all this sort of stuff right they were screaming screaming they were write the sound they made as they flapped right it was like a scream of a thousand animals screaming and screeching the screech at you it was ripping your ass at the time and then when he was doing that shifting you were down below deck right that kind of stuff the sounds the soyuz of the ship made her groan around with all these noises right makes it sound like the ship 's gonna rip apart ah but not to be king she 'd be a for that and she survived right remember we had all the best sales in there right and you 'd have to foil and unfurl the sales in between where the soils got the squalls died down a bit right you 'd put up more soil right we 'd have the lower topsoils up from all this trip right to keep us moving forward but then when things ease off you have to get up there and full and unfold the sail so furling all right is when you 're putting them up and unfolding is when you put them down remember these are square rigger right okay so you had your yards all right there we go make sure she 's the right way up so they 're your yards remember the sails be up there all right so you 'd come along right and the only thing you 'd have to stand now was those ropes yeah there 's a rope underneath there right that kind of stuff so you 're standing you got your belly there right you 're leaning over the yard right you 've got your you go down you lean right down right and the rope comes up with you right because your feet are just on the rope and then just go ahead nothing else is secured you 're right you 're just holding on and doing all that kind of stuff this is when the sails you can see like that one there you 're starting to go like this oh my god sometimes the boat 's going right over like yourself and you 're up there for the sails down and pulling them up pulling it down and that 's what we did just to keep it up and going and keep the sails going to keep us pounding around that horn or into the wind fighting our way around like good sail as we were right proud what we 're doing things you want to see you 'd never do anywhere else that 'd be true that 's it you can see there 's no safety ropes there right these guys just sitting there that way that was us right feet on there you know failing and unfollowing this heels that how strong these ones are right the lower top soles right to strengthen them up to strengthen them up right they had like as big as your thumb right not a decent size some there was a wire in the edge of the sail there to toughen it up and keep it strong that 's how it wouldn 't rip right but on that trip the winds were so strong it actually shredded one of those top sails right absolutely shredded it and that wire that 's flapping around and it 's kind of scripted also i said that makes a ripple look like that so we had to get it down right we had to get that there 's nothing we could do about that right so some paul bloider volunteered for the job right because he was nearest that 's how you volunteer you 're there you have to do it right so he 's squaring it across right got out of the air and he 's trying to reach over and unsecure it like it was stuck around there so they could drip that sail down and things like that and they get another seal up right they 're trying to save it and rescue it all that stuff and it was too far down he couldn 't do it so with that blinder right he actually got all of the masks with his arm and his leg and he hung down like that right hung down like that off of the yard right so he could reach it and he 's understood through that and just then right he 's hanging there like that or he got hit by another huge wind and that sailor right that sailor he flapped like a sail he was going flat his whole body was just flapping and vibrating like a sail you 've never seen anything like it i 've never seen ever since it was amazing he 's flapping and flapping he 's holding on for dear life and his life level then he stopped it he 's unsecured and he 's got back down and again nobody said a thing because you just don 't talk about that kind of stuff right but it was amazing to time has passed and all that kind of stuff and i know you won 't tell anybody we just learned but it was amazing you do things that say you 'd never do on land you never do it and you do it because your ship needs you right you need you and you don 't think twice about it because that 's what happened when you 're a sailor right your city your ship she 's your bond she 's your everything and you do anything for her and that 's the kind of breather your shoulders are getting around the horn right as we tailed all the way around there right it was amazing stuff right all right and so we eventually we got all the way around the horn right sailing her up there and we started hazing it up and went up to the port and chile and we picked up some nitrates all right and then we sail back down back around and do it again right but you know the only thing that was dry when you get there right now i told you on a ship other than you 'd sleep in your clothes and then warm you up and dry your through it so basically everything would be soaking wet except for the hole you 'd keep that dry right so that 'd be completely dry otherwise there 's no purpose to the whole thing so the whole the keeping it dry was everything doubly more when you pick up the load that we had from chile right because what you picked up from chile in the old days when we were trading all that kind of stuff was nitrates right nitrates they used to make exposes and fertilizer and that kind of stuff right and nitrates got the peculiarity which is quite tricky at sea that if they get wet they actually catch fire right they 're combustible in water crazy stuff but true right crazy so i can tell you stories of ships catching fire because of the they got the nitrates wet no that kind of goes ahead and back they launched probably all right very weird stuff right so we had to keep them all that dry so all kept dry and sealed and all that kind of stuff so you would never get it done because it all nitrates and we bring that back down in fact the nitrates trade right when we talk about steam ships last week all right started overtaking from sailing boats you know not disappointed but in general trading all that the last ships to go the only commercial route that was actually successful and keep going on sales right up to the 1940s you 'd be surprised to know sailing ships were still doing cargo right in 1940s right and that was they go from europe right and they 'd get all the goods and uh you know like bring pills pianos and all sorts of things back right and they would sail around from there around in there underneath the cape down there underneath africa right and then they would sail all the way all across australia and melbourne and places like that right and they would drop off the goods over there right and back round up the city and then get off some more goods there and then pile of coal right and then they would say okay that cold or chili right and in chile they drop the coal off they pick up nitrates and then they go around up like all right up the other side and take those night tracks to europe and i start again right that worked right up the 1940s because they weren 't spending all money on petrol and stuff like that because there were low profit uh you know things by that time right that was still viable right up in the 1940s because you say it wasn 't using anything was just you know the power of labor and all that kind of stuff that 's the kind of tree they kept on doing and all that kind of stuff and that 's what it was you know interesting stuff and trades and all that kind of stuff but that is like you know where i learned me trade of sailing and all those things like you know jerking instead of poland and all that sort of stuff i learned by actually doing it like fire and brimstone they those boys right you see them you see there look at that waves crashing over this way that 'd be true sailing right that 'd be true to you that 'd be true adventure when you 've got that all happening right crashing and that would be glorious there might be glorious times that we were sealing the unfollowed that kind of stuff of course there was a lot of money in it as a general sailor so i went to piracy because that 's where the cash was and uh and now you just stick around in the caribbean and noise spots to sail where it ain 't so bad and all that kind of stuff let 's get those big storms but it was always those little tricks i learned by actually concentrating and listening and watching the captain now hold the old beven and what he did and all those little tricks he had with his handle in the ships and the way he handled it at that time have sent me a good step all the time so i 'm hoping that you guys listening to fine sailors right come find pirates and enjoy yourself out of the seas are and of course that 'd be the end of lesson right so i just been giving her a bit of a taste of what it 's like to sail around the horn and be on one of these big ships remember this ship right be s probably two and a half times the size of the beatrice that 's how big it is right a huge big ship okay huge big length big weight a lot of kind of stuff and a crew huge amount of crew just working all the time working that ship right to get around the horn and fight against nature right and winning all right just through the power of our wills and our muscle and the strength of sails that be the glory days of sail ah i still remember it well ah my ship mates it between him these all should be he 's a stand to ramble so i think it might be time to toddle off so i 'm gonna pipe us down and i 'll be and then maybe 29 and then i 'm thinking in 30 we might do a summary because i 'm not sure how much longer we 're going to go but for now i 'm going to pipe us all down so you all be happy little shipmates and i 'll be catching you next time so it 's farewell from the captain ha ha hoy there hahaha you thought i forgot that one standing for it just a quick one to the end say me hotties _"

r r give me another r r put it all together you can still spell that 's good to know all right the artie 's we 'll be back we 'll be back all right remember what are we talking about you 're putting your starboard okay right your porch inside the left right starve it at the front that 's the bow right the back 's the earth brother stern keep remembering that things because lesson number 30 i 'm gonna do like a summary a wrap up all the different things right because you won 't be coming to an end of the all tv tv but we 'll see but right now i 'm gonna talk to you about a few old priorities superstitions and stuff like that right some old things that we used to live by you know never used to live by so you didn 't right you just keep of soap in their back pocket right you know that bar is soap that was in case if they went overboard right into the ocean and all that kind of stuff they can actually wash themselves ashore right now i 'm gonna do live proper superstitions proper superstitions right you know one 's like you know we used to have uh not take any bananas bananas are bad luck right you don 't take bananas right it 's all come from when spain and the caribbean they used to have ships going back and forth in the 1700s right and they used to have cargoes or bananas right boxes of boxes bananas right bananas they go off fast right they lost lots and lots of them that 's that was when it became dangerous everyone knew something was wrong because all these ships gone back was the fours and the common denominator was like boxes of bananas right so it 's unlucky right but bananas they spoil a quake right to get from spain to caribbean it 's a fair sale so they 'd have to stuff so that was one issue right but also they go off right they go off pretty quick right and they ferment right i went a banana for men it gives off a hell of a stench right that 's stench and it 's actually a toxic fume so some of the sailors would have got overcome by fumes right and also they can 't catch fish right because the smell of the bananas actually scares off the fish so they get hungry it 's all that kind of stuff there were tales about these spiders that used to creep aboard on the panerai and then they come out they would attack the crew and stuff like that and they 'd die of poisoning from all sorts of stuff so basically you don 't put a banana on a ship right keep the bananas away that 's a big or that kind of stuff right and what else it was there right so oh we talked before about whistling you know you don 't whistle on a ship right because you whistle up the wind we 've we covered that deloitte red sky and morning sailor take warning all right we live by that right anytime you see a red sky at night you know it 's gonna be good day the next day but you see the red sky in the morning right that means it 's going to be raining and squalling and all kinds of things like that right so it 's something to know about it 's all to do with the atmospherics and all that kind of stuff there 's probably a logical reason for a lot of these airsoft decisions but you learn them as a superstition right and then you know that gives you an easy way for people to remember things and be safe and see and all that kind of stuff and that 's what all these oral histories are about right they totally share your story and the story has a meaning that actually protects you in life and all that kind of stuff you 'll see that in oxford culture right so one of the things we like shark trailer in the ship right it 's a shark behind bad luck you don 't want to be seeing that but if you 're actually sailing with dolphins swimming beside you that 'd be lucky right so these are different things you 'll be able to get right that kind of stuff right a different day your different words right you wouldn 't want to say different words remember last time we were talking about going around the horn right we were going to the horn and the crew men got lost in like we didn 't talk about it that 's the kind of thing right so words like drowned you never said round on the ship right or uh good boy or good luck that was seen as being the ultimate in bad luck when you do that right and these bad luck things they could only be turned around with a blood sacrifice which basically meant one of us would punch the other guy in their nose versus being so stupid as to say it right and that 'd be the way you sort of deal with that one right kind of thing like that and there weren 't good to sail on like uh well fridays obviously because you know that 's the day they crucified jesus and all that kind of stuff so people think well that got to be bad luck you know and most people think fight is a bad luck all right and thursday 's a bad day to sail because that 'd be thor day right thursday is thor day right and he 'd be the god of thunder lightning storms and all that kind of stuff so we don 't do that we 're multi-denominational church when it comes to bad luck and all that kind of stuff you know we we take a bit of everything right and uh oh the first uh monday in april that 'd be a bad day that 'd be a bad day because you know well that 'd be the day that whatever i forgot what that day was april thursday and april wise oh that was the day that cain 's the way what 's another biblical one that 's right i remember now cain 's through all the first day of was saddam and gabor that day where the big all those towns fell and all that kind stuff so that scene is a bad day as well i mean lots of sailors are so superstitious they 'll only set sail on a sunday all right but not me um you know i 'm a bit more loose on things like that but you know that 's other things they had like sailors that have a hole in their ear right once you went around the old horn right you got a hole in your ear a lot of sailors have put a big gold hoopie earring in like that for good look right it 'd be good look and i thought the gold had healing powers and could save you from drowning all right that 's the kind of thing someone would wear the big gold earring in there because they think if they 'd have it there to pay the you know the boatman on the river sticks if they 're going to heaven and all that sort of stuff they could pay to go across to the afterlife maybe if i 've got it there somebody will pay for my funeral and all that kind of stuff but mostly people would just take it and steal it and all that kind of stuff so that didn 't work out as good as they would have hoped you know that kind of uh superstition but yeah generally the superstitions were pretty good pretty good right you know uh people who didn 't pay their debts they were seen as unlucky so if the ship had problems or sunk or anything like that you lost the cargo and all that right that was blamed on the guy hadn 't paid his debts right so you double your problems that way different animals are seen as lucky as well like the albatross right you see an albatross because they supposed to carry the sailor 's soul right their characters kill your soul right so that 's what they 'll be lost souls or sailors up with the albatross right so if you saw one it was lucky but if you killed one that is as bad as the look could get turtles as many as we could catch right but right there but you had to eat them right if you killed the turtle and you didn 't eat it that was horrendously bad luck all right so these are the things you only kill what you need and what you 're eating all that kind of stuff you know it 's got to be sustainable right we 'd like to be sustainable so human right that kind of thing but that 's the korean thing we used to do right all these kind of little superstitions we used to live by to just sort of teach us the way of doing things and all that kind of stuff you know they 're really important stuff to a sailor 's life they 're important that you luring them if you 're going to be a pirate and moisture and all that kind of stuff you know i mean we could be wrong about these superstitions you know it 's not necessarily wrong about everything i mean you know they all say it err is human to r is pirate haha that me another r put them all together and they spell here having another tale all right i 'm going to tell you about you saying sayings and stuff like that you know we keep going over and you you 'd be amazed how many saiyans actually come just from being a ship right all this ship right every time you think you think how could that possibly be related to sailing you know somewhere obviously like when you take something on board you know you take notice of something you can take that on board remember the board is the top bit of the ship that 's when you get on board of the ship right that 's that one in deep water that 's another oh i 'm in deep water well that 's pretty obvious what that is isn 't it right all hands on deck remember all the similar call hands right so all hands on decks is we need everyone to do it we 're in the big storm like we 're talking about on the go around horn right we go all hands on deck and all that all got to come up and put the sails up or break the sails down on the big storm right fall in and unfurl and remember all that stuff from last week they 're all good easy saiyans right you know another one is on the right tack you know when you 're on the right attack you 're going sort of the right way and all that kind of stuff well tacking and we 've covered that in the ceiling thing too really tackles when you 're going into the wind right so you 're working the right way so when you 're on the right tack right you 're picking the right one to go through all right to get there the fastest right so you 're on the right track you 're doing the right thing that 's where they all come from right make up the leeway right when you 're going to make up the leeway all right leeway is how much you 're off your course right because the wind blows you off as you 're going along and then you up the leeway is trying to make things up to make them up to even or like myself that 's when you 're getting your back on course that 's where that comes from make up the lever you know that 's how it was bottoms up that 's another good one bottoms up your bottom 's up but everyone drinks and a lot of stuff do you know that comes from those dastardly old admiralty guys right those english guys and all that kind of stuff right they used to shang away right crew right shaggy or press gang they used to call it right where they go and get people right they got them in the pub a lot of the time right now they don 't hear anything all that kind of stuff but what they used to say is if you take in the you know the admiralty 's coin right they 've been a coin you 'd agreed to join that join them right you couldn 't actually fight that legally that would go legally in court right so what they used to do the 's drink right they 've ah a drink all right i 'm gonna drink with him we 're all friendly drink it at the bottom of the glass there 's a coin right and that would be the admiral 's coin and once you 've done empty the glass the coin falls out you 've got it and it that 's it they 've got you all right legally they can take you off to sea and you 'd be gone for months or years or whatever they took you remember at the emerald leader that was very hard to get out right and it wasn 't a great lie from literature dropship and joined me as a pirate so that 's where they used to say bottoms up it was actually checking the bottom of the glass there right there well you bought i 'm gonna see you like that so that was where bottoms up coming from even right the old hain right what else is there now oh uh show your true colors that 's another one we sort of covered with flags right and the tricks sailing all right that kind of stuff like that when you show your true colours is when you put out the boiler effect basically you 're saying along there with your normal flower don 't worry about me i 'm not anything to worry about you 're sailing along you 're gonna like that kind of stuff and then when you get close to you you hoist the colors right you pull out the border and you get higher and then you start firing right that 's where you hoist yourself when you show your true flat colours because flags are called colours right that 's the other name for flags is the colours the curry one 's jib all right cutter one 's jib you remember we 're talking the sale that front little triangle sail right is the jib right and the cut is the front line of a sail right so they 're cutting your gym so you want that firm you don 't want that flapping and all that kind of stuff otherwise you 're not on the right course once it 's firm into the on the wind right and that 's nice and tight down there like the kind of stuff so the cut of your jib is how straight and true it is they 're like that right so that 's a trap and that 's the same the cut of your jib is you know what kind of person you are and all that kind of stuff right scraping the bottom of the barrel you know ah whisk even the bottom of there on that one well that was when the food remember tell you we need to carry all our own food and it runs out right and then the little bits of droid beef and stuff like that right there over there it 'd be at the bottom of the barrel and the chef would be scraping out the last bits of it right and then making it into like a broth or something like that for us to eat and all that kind of stuff so they would actually scrape out the bottom of the barrel once you 've got the scrape down bottle the barrel you know you beam all right broader the beam here that means you 've got a bigger arse really bigger broader beam he 's brought to the b major solid around the backside andrew johns was a good one he was broader than the baby oh that 's john 's boys big asses all right but so the beam right be the widest bit of the ship you know when you see the ship power it goes in a long shape and it goes out up the middle the beam is the middle bit right the middle brace around there like that that 's the beam so when you 're broad over the beam that 's the water is part of that so that means more sensitive uh what stem the toys another one all right when we 're talking about the ship and shape of the ship stem this time remember we talked about the stem that 's the front of the ship that the all the boards are attached to that comes down right through the middle that 's the stem that front bit is the stem right so when you tide right so again like in real in the where it works now is an expression you know stem the tide you 're going against you 're stopping things from going this way you will stand the tigers when you 're actually pushing against the tide so some mornings most mornings you try to go out with a toy but sometimes you would go against the toilet that 's when you 're stemming the tide you deal that and you 're trying to work your way against the toilet there 's a harder seal in there to get away from the toilet and all that kind of stuff because you got to push through it you 're going against the way things work and overfist that 's another one we sort of covered right hand over this remember we 're talking about doing the ropes so you 're grabbing with you then you make it a fist and the other hand comes over the top right so hand over fist is when you 're working real hard you know we 're doing the jerk we 're talking about doing the that 's all hand over fist right bailout that 's another obvious one bail out right you know you 're talking about bailing out a ship right be on that that actually comes from a french word bail means book it all right bail with an e and b little french oh baby but right it so let 's bail it out with a book bail out that 's easy with a bail something out you 're just getting things out of there windfall that 's an interesting one a windfall right is when you 're near the mountainous coast and you get an every now and then you 'll get a burst of wind that comes down the mountains that actually burst the winds it gets you going faster and all that that 's like so it 's an unexpected burst of wind you get off a mountainous sort of region when you 're sailing past it right and that 's where wind fall comes from like if you get a windfall is an unexpected bonus and that 's what you 're getting when you 're sailing the mount which is an effect bonus right bitter end that 's another good one all right bitter end hard it sounds really honest but actually the end of the anchor right it 's a big rope where i lie you know we put the rogue out we traveled we 've talked about anchors a bit before and all that kind of stuff around the last bit is called the bit it 's tied off last bit is actually tied to the bitter the bit sorry hi the nice bit is tied to the bit the last section of the rope is doing to the bit which is at the bow of the bolt right there that 's where it 's tied off on right so if you get to the bitter end of the rope right you 're at the end of the roll but you know what the end of the rope is again the same thing but the anchor might not have got to the bottom of the thing so you 're not being able to anchor where you are at the time so you 've reached the better the end of your rope is you know the same sort of thing another one there i thought was through thick and thin yeah thick and thin you think what does that really mean through think of thin remember we talked about pulleys you remember the pulleys we talked about right well they have bigger pulleys and thin pulleys right and so sometimes and the more pulleys you have the easier the job is to lift heavier things so if things have gone through thick and thin they 've gone through all the things the pulleys and the thin pulleys that was where that came from it was from think of thing it was actually talking about the pulleys and all that kind of stuff and then it 's come to me more and all that kind of stuff under the weather that 's another obvious one you know when you 're under the weather you know you 're not feeling that crash art if the ship 's getting bashed about by huge amounts of weather rate the rain and the squalls and the wind and all that kind of 's lots of these saiyans and i can do more next week even i 'll do some more next week i 've got a few other things i 'm going to have next week i thought i 'd talk about ships different sorts of vessels you know you talk about you know all the different types of frigates and all sorts of things so you can talk how you can recognize them so when you look at them they just oh that 's just a sailing ship or a tall ship or something like that you know i should go no no that 's a bar car that 'd be a bargain would that be a park right so we 'll cover all that sort of stuff i 'm going to talk about william dampier right he 's a famous part around these parts right around australia and all that kind of stuff so you learn about him he did all sorts of interesting stuff probably and down for you right and uh who else what else are you going to do some more saiyans all that kind of stuff cover the last one i was going to cover is right is skyscraper all right skyscraper you know really tall buildings and you go what captain you 're full of it you 're full of it captain you go you 're full of it now go how dare you lad how dare you you 're looking i don 't take my slavery out right now no that 's true skyscraper actually comes from the old sailing ships remember the ship i showed you last week right the beaking right the big tall master on that the very top sale on the main sail the highest tail layer of the whole thing right it was called the sky sale right and they 're right they put a stay sail in across from that like a little triangle estate sale right that runs across the stays right and they call that the skyscraper right and they used to and when you 're in town you saw what 's it for the beaches when we were up a port there before right we were tied in port you saw how much higher all town the highest thing you can see would be the top sale of one of these big ships and the top little sale of that the sky sail would be there like that and that was a skyscraper right so that 's where the idea of a skyscraper comes from right they just applied it to architecture as well because that was already the highest thing there so they just took that name and brought it over to the skyscraper and you wouldn 't have thought that was possible that that actually came from maritime history right from the sailors and all that new pirates but it did it did it 's true it 's crazy but it 's true all this stuff it all comes from sailors because look around you you 're surrounded by sea and then who rules the sea we pirates do give yourselves an r give yourselves another r r put them all together we 're doing for another week 28 we 've got to 28 so this week is 29. amazing i 'm not sure i can count much higher than this i 've things and we want to eat but that 's another story maybe a week out of my teeth who knows but we 'll be back next week but for now it 's time to rest back down after you 'll be excited spits flowing everywhere anyway i might drown it here and need to bail out the ship i think because there 's too much tonight i 'm drowning bail out man anyway i think i should whisk this all down wipe this all down before we uh go crazy if i whistle now we 'd be in trouble because that 's bad luck oh my goodness it 's all come back see how you learn things just like that it 's amazing just like that just like that all right miati 's little bit off be seeing you next week come on stand and laugh like a pirate _"

    "text": "yes it 's true we 'll be back for lesson number 25 who 'd have thought we 'd survive to 25 but we 're still here and we 're still going give me an r r give me another r r put them all together and they do d say r it was a spell r i 've been doing that 25 maybe even more times than that and i still get it wrong that 's the glory of being a pirate and being online with you here then i just ramble all the piratey stuff now you 've been thinking should i be real captain things and cover things again in case you missed it the first time but i thought no that 'd be boring maybe i should do a log right put in the ship 's log and record all the different episodes right and what you can see if you want to learn something you go about no different log if you haven 't seen them all and all that kind of stuff like that so maybe that 's the way we should do it the i think i 'm just going to plow on until i pull down the curtain all right on the old captain all that and cover more things so we 'll do more new things as we go along we 'll keep doing stuff cause every now and then we 'll do a quiet laugh all that sort of stuff but generally we 're just going to keep plowing on with new stuff right next week i 'm thinking we 'll do it back to some adventures i 'll do some more piratey adventures some of the great uh victories of some of the pirates all right so we 'll do some more of those all right but this week we 're doing some more factories all the stuff little factoids all right so now wow last week right i talked about right that was when they were pulling the ship up remember drake and he pulled his ship up right so he could creed over and they could clean it off and all that kind of stuff and they 're tied and all that sort of stuff so somebody asked the ship needs you know care and all that kind of stuff where do you take it when it 's a sick ship you know what do you do what do you do and you say well we take it to the dock no but it 's true the dry dock there 's a thing called a dry duck right so what you do is you sail up to the dry dock right but that 's how you do your dock and then they use the pulleys and winches like we did before to ease her into the dock there like that and then they seal it behind it right and then they pump out all the water and it 's got a little cradle there right and the bolt settles down into the cradle and then people can get around and work on it no one will like which makes a lot safer than having to tighten it over with ropes and all that kind of things because if you don 't secure the ropes properly many a captain come astray by toying up the wrong sort of trees up to a few of those and they get pulled out by the ship and rocks back and crushes people all sorts of problems all right so drydock be much safer right so just the way we all to do it they will draw your dog hard that 'd be right and uh yeah you know it 's important to keep it shipped clean and and uh repaired and all that kind of stuff because more pirate ships got sunk right boy bugs else you know and things like that into the hall and all that sort of stuff and the bristles and all that kind of stuff then got sunk by cannon and also when you got all the barnacles and stuff and that just slows you down you want to slick holes so you can shoot through the water quick like when you 're trying to escape and all that kind of stuff right right that 's what you always do and then people say you know do you know do the pirate ships used to sink often well only once i think once even once that 's likes to be the beatrice right you talk to the beatrice beautiful beatrice they like that they say how do you keep it looking so ship shape and bristol fashion you know and looking so young and healthy like it looks you know that hundred year old ship 's a couple hundred year old there right still looks vibrant like that how do you do that well it 's boat dogs no no it 's not true you know it 's like keeping good care and put in the dry duck and looking after it that way that 's the way we used to look after our ships right in the old days now but you don 't see as many of these around us more anymore do you you don 't really see them around as much as you used to right why is that because they 've been replaced happened in the mid-1800s right early to mid-1800s suddenly they started appearing all these steam ships steam ships yep the end of the industrial revolution they 've been doing steam for everything else and they went ah we 're it 's true steam ships right they started off here like this one here right the rose this is get that nice and close throws the rolls right this is the rolls right cheeseburger steamship see that little there that round thing there that 's a big paddle streamer right see it 's got a chimney because you 've got a big like a big stove they used to put sort of coal and all that kind of stuff and then they would just paddle along and that would be driven along by that early on right because they needed so much coal to do it for the longer journeys they 'd have to use sail and all that kind of stuff the rose right the rose was one of the first steel old uh steamers right they came out to work around the street around the coast of australia right they came up the rolls the shamrock and the thistle fire good irish name is those one i guess you know they all come over right scottish name okay there they all came over what they did is they just used the sails to come over because it was so far and i got over that but once they were around here they were the 60 milers right so they used to travel from sydney up to newcastle and more birth right to pick up coal and all that sort of stuff up there and uh and the goods that were growing up and them up right for that was a feeding the sydney colony right and the rose that was one of the first ones to come over and now the first ones made out with a steel hole right because the steel worked better as they got along right but that was what the rules there okay but yeah basically they work with a big paddle and a big stove which could be dangerous you know the stove right there that port we know about newcastle again right it used to be really dangerous before they built the beach in there in between the island of knobbies or even turned it into a headland or that way that they used to actually just be an island right think they could sneak in in a big storm those big southerly as we talked about before right and then we 'll be getting there and suddenly they 'll be the waves be crashing over them and they 're there when they go around trying to get around lobbies and they think oh i think we 've got to go back out and they would turn and go back out but as they would turn and go back out ways to crash over the deck put out their engine right put the fire out once it was out they had no way to go for it and the wind would just push them across over into the reef on the other side if you go up there even today there 's lots of wrecks there is scattered along the old breakwater they build a brick wall on top of where the rex were because there 's a little reef there and all that sort of stuff but that was one of the issues with these steam ships when they started all right but gradually they got better and faster right a call and all that to do it to run them they went for the high value target so a lot of them end up being passenger ships as well you know really all the things they get money for and they could do that faster than a sailing boat so sailor boats were left to do jobs like coal just carrying coal across the atlantic stuff like that things to do with that in fact gradually they became to take over right and the big change was later on on that they worked out the propeller id you 're the screw properly which the way you think like turns around and makes the vote go at the back like that once that happened that was sort of the death knell of the old sailing ship as a working ship because that was much more efficient and also because like this one being a steelhole having a propeller at the back puts a great deal of pressure on the actual wood at the back so you need more wood and all kinds of so it became cheaper to build the those kind of boats and eventually these boats started going out you know and there was less treasure ships and all that kind of stuff so pirate and started to fade out a bit there and that was the end of the golden age of piracy and something little offended the steam other interesting thing about these damages right is this block would have been the ss rolls right ss before you know like hms all that ss do you think are they the sailors you said they weren 't tricky well they 're not what do you think ss stands for steam ship see easy stuff you know that now next time you see a ssc oh it 's a steam ship right or an mv motor vessel right that 's it not real clever not real tricky they just make you think oh i know that now and it 's just stuck about your brain pan for later on right so that 's the important things that happened with the old steam vessels right and so part and started to disappear a little bit right all the employers 're deafblind you 're in here i 'm here i 'm a pirate but i 'm not the only one in fact piracy up until this you know coverty time that we go through now which has made things all a bit bizarrely confused was actually been on the increase over 500 reports of piracy every year that 's more than one a day right they 're just the ones they report right and these pirates are still out there going and ploying their trade all right just you know some things have changed like they don 't have the walk in the plank anymore and they 're not really wearing oily patches and stuff like that and uh you know they don 't use the colors nowadays they use weapons like the ak-47 and those rocket launchers right now okay and instead of you know oi patches and charts and maps and stuff like that and the log box right they use gps 's right and vision night vision goggles and all that sort of stuff right so they 've changed but they 're still using speedy small boats like that you know what i was saying about you know the beer just being a quick boat around the coast and all that kind of stuff same thing but they use speed boats now and they zoom up and they catch them right and what do they do they do similar sorts of tactics as well right similar tactics as well it 's like they tend to attack cargo ships right in the big cargo ships they 'll go out and take them over right now take over a cargo ship and actually they 'll hold them for ransom right and what happens is sometimes they 'll murder in the crew but generally they just hold the ship for ransom right so we 're doing the maroon and still there right you know bang bang them together like that still doing that kind of stuff right but they 'll do the ship and it 's cheaper right for those shipping companies just to pay off the pirates don 't worry about trying to get rid of them and do all that kind of stuff so they 'll just pay we 're talking about by having a you know a good relationship with your uh victims right that kind of stuff you can get paid off and that 's low risk for everybody so that 's a good thing you know some of those partners get a bit adventurous right a bit of interest and take on cruise lines i think ah because you rubble the crew of all the diamonds and stuff like that and then you got all the food and drink and all that sort of stuff which makes it a bit attractive right if you struggle for a meal at all and all that kind of stuff but generally these days they do the cargo ships and that 's the way they operate you know of course i said they don 't use the cutlass but many of them will wave a machete or two will be intimidating all that kind of stuff and the machete actually is a descendant of the old cutlass right that 's where the cup grew developed too so the cutlass if you think of a machete blade right they don the cover right to put your hand for the punching bit of it but they tend to be used for the same things like that and they 're a slashing tool and that 's where the old machete comes from right you know where the cut yourself ended up ruining as it got less specialized and all that kind of stuff so we get more of that kind of tool so that 's a different way all right now what else was it going to cover right now we talked about all that kind of stuff oh and one last thing that 's very similar to them if you think about the areas where the pirates are over right they 're in east africa the south china sea uh south america and the caribbean that 's where the pirates mostly operate now so right that 's you know that 's where you 'd probably meet a pirate right although you probably don 't want to meet the pirate these days because not all of them are as friendly as me i heard that be right because you know i 'm you on that kind of stuff you don 't want to doing other things but you know these boy and some of that oh another thing about the rolls remember the rules something i was going to tell you about the rose right all right there was a young lass that was born on the rose right born on the rose on the journey coming over right this takes months and months and months for them to use to get over here the record for sailing from england to australia right went on sale it used to be about 65 days right 65 days actually there 's a good story about that record right all right there was a guy over there captain he was going to break the record right he is in the best ship and he was the best guy a bit like that shane warren fella you 've got these things like about really full of himself he thought he was really good right and so he was there and he went over there that big pumping ceremony was the star captain of the day you he 's breaking the record from london to melbourne all right actually probably was post month in melbourne right so he 's going to break their all over england then all the way down right he was going to do it right i 'm captain and i thought yeah that 'd be right and what happened was they hit the doldrums right remember the doldrums that means when there 's no enough wind you know that so the record got blown out the window so after that this cat lost interest all together right all together right what happened is as they were passing down the bottom of victoria there right okay they got in too close to the shore and they tried to get the captain up there 's a big storm they got part of that they tried to get the captain up right just to help him get solve their problem but they said he was too busy playing cards with a 19 year old female passenger to come up and take over the ship right and so what happened they ran aground and the whole ship right in australia where they actually you know tried that captain for negligence right and he got two years jail all right that was but that was the first naval case in australia and it was because he was just couldn 't be bothered once there was no record he just said i might as well enjoy myself and play some cards with this new glass right and so that 's another little tale you get all these little facts which may not be of any interest to you but they keep coming out what could i say what could i say all right now i 'm going to finish off with a couple more of these sayings a few more of these sayings right that you have oh rosalina right i was talking about rosina the birth all right the rosina right she was born on this airship right and because she was born on the ship they have to register your birth as your first place of port after that so she was said to be born in sydney because that 's where she landed in the ship and her relatives right down to the years ended up hooking up with israelites right so that 's through two naval families right two outgoing families because their father be a master on this ship right end up getting together right and that 's what happens when you live around an island in the sea where people all come by boats they still come by boats right that 's where you 'll come from boats and that 's how people get together right because you live in a big island that 's just a little story there we digress okay i 'm gonna do three more saiyans and then we 'll be getting ready for the lesson number twenty six oh my goodness who would have thought it 'd pick up tricks on 36. or some other rhyme that 'll come to me next week who knows who knows all right oh my god hard up you 're about being hired up you know you got nothing left you 're up against it you broke your skin to all that kind of stuff well when a boat was forced by they tell you when they put the helm hard to win wind right to turn away from the weather because it 's just too much that was cool being hard up you 're up against the weather so you 're gonna turn over and that 's what it is you know when you 're up against it broke and all that kind of stuff you said to be hired up and that 's where it comes from and it 's another maritime sale saying and then when they say yeah i 'm gonna take you down a pig you 're that one right that wasn 't really a priority thing that was more the abnormal leader stuff like that because what happened was like our pirate flag we do have an upward hound and that kind of stuff you know we won 't pretend to be another ship some of that but that was ever really bold right the flags were secured by a series of pigs right so they can have it at different heights and so if they were passing some certain dignitary would go by that would it was like the queen or something it 'd be the top peg right and then the flag would be up as high as it possibly could and if you were less popular or less important they would bring it down a peg all right so they take you down a pig and i suppose if you lost sort of you know they suddenly didn 't like you anymore they could bring you down and take up down a pig and that 's what it was just basically take it from this peg down to the next peg all right and that would alter the height of the flags and that 's what they call taking you down a pig right that 's where that comes from and the last one was crossing the line you 've heard about crossing the loin it 's when something when you cross the line something momentous is about to happen you know you 're taking a big step all right well that 's because we used to celebrate right and still do or if you 're going to see now they celebrate when the glowing all right that 's something celebrates the first time a sailor crosses the equator they have a big ceremony you know they dress him up funny like neptune sword and all sorts of things like throw things all over them they make them drink weird stuff and all that kind of stuff so if ever you 're on a boat and you get across the equator and you 've never done it before there will be a big ceremony because crossing the line the equator would seem to be something that has something amazing and extraordinary and that 's where carson line comes from so again all these little phrases that you just think are part of everyday life especially old everyday life now you 're all got texts and emojis and all that kind of stuff we didn 't have no emojis on these boats i don 't think oh wait a minute well that could be something else we had semaphore right semaphore which was basically the beginnings of emojis right because those flags that represented words all right so symbols representing words which is basically kind of thing so we could do some emojis even so you know it 's all coming from the old pirates and this evening anyway we be done that be it we 're all done we 're all shipshape and bristol fashion the beatrice still looking beautiful boy bear we put the rose down but we 're all gonna be pointed down right now we 'll have a little bit of a nap and we 'll be back next week for lesson number 26. oh my goodness will we get to 30 who knows who knows when the typhoon will come and take us all away but for now i think we 'll just go back and have a nap or maybe we 'll see a shinty or two but for me i 'm gonna pipe us down you 'd be having a good time my lovelies ah first there _"

relax modify it if you need to change it change it to make it work for you so it is efficient and it is safe let 's get started so i 'm at the very end of my map we 're going to take two steps to our right well at least to the side right now my squat today is a little bit wider i 'll tell you why because i want to use more of my inner thigh that 's right inner thigh so as i step out i step out with my toes slightly facing out that way my knees don 't do all the hard work the focus is on my leg muscles now feel okay with that that 's great stay there don 't feel pressure to go deeper if you want harder more intensity you go deeper in the squat however make sure when you squat that the weight is balanced from one side of the leg to the other side let 's do two more inhale and exhale great let 's keep the band there let 's not waste time time is very precious so i 've got a yellow band which is the lightest and the easiest of the colors in my particular weight band selection arms are straight in front arms are shoulder high soft knees tailbone tucked under and i 'm lifting that chest proud all i 'm doing is extending the arms now have a look it 's one straight line across my arms come back in shoulder width apart and parallel now you can see that i 'm not extending the arms super wide you don 't have to if your band allows that that 's great but no pressure to do that so i 'm activating pelvic floor activating abdominal muscles and i 'm breathing super let 's keep the band where it is we don 't want to waste time i 'm gonna pick up my trusty dumbbell and i 'm gonna do some shoulder presses again knees are soft tailbone under eyes looking straight ahead shoulders are sitting back it 's a straight press towards the ceiling have a look you can see that my arms are going straight up to the ceiling they 're not doing this and they 're not doing this straight up all right i 'm going to get down to the knees so you can see what i 'm doing there you go all right abdominal muscles are switched on team switch on good there we go three exercises we 've got legs we 've got chest and arms and we 've got some shoulders and back work as well let 's get done started with a little routine of 10 of each inhale exhale one and breathe and two and breathe three and breathe full and breathe good remember stay up high if that works for you especially if you 're new to exercise or you 've a lot of gym or exercise work take it easy be kind to your body you 've got energy to burn you 've had that coffee i 've had one coffee so i 'm good and here for another one very soon you want more get down get up get down get up get down get up inhale exhale my heart rate 's gone up i 'm sure yours will too bang right so the band is around the wrist okay we don 't want it too high that puts a little bit more straight on our elbow joint work hard and play safe right that 's my motto ready inhale inhale just breathe you know let 's not get too technical and scientific about the breathing unless we have to stay in a yoga class where it 's breathing nose to nose but here you want to make sure you 're breathing in and out all right team four more and three and two and one slip it off grab the dumbbell all right again you can use a brick you can use a rock it doesn 't really 't have to go out and buy lots of equipment uh when my daughter was really small she was a little tiny bug and i didn 't have time to go to the gym i looked at my backyard and i used whatever i had in my backyard or in my room and that was my equipment so press for eight seven six can 't_''_380.72 see what i 'm doing no problemo all right there you go four inhale exhale three two one good job all right round three i hope you are feeling this a little bit i am so which is good so let 's go a little bit more intense for the third and the last round i 'm gonna wrap my band around me so i don 't need to spend time keeping it up and throwing it down all right team last round let 's make this work three two one step and squat good sit down get up sit down get up sit down get up get sit down get up sit down get up and breathe and breathe and breathe and breathe come grab that band let 's keep moving keep the heart rate up that 's what it 's all about getting your heart rate up okay it 's not just lifting heavy weight it 's not just jumping or running faster it 's about what we are actually doing when we 're exercising and breathe one two three four five six seven eight nine ten rock it in last one pick up abdominal remember bend your knees so to make sure you can see me in the video here we go now remember we 're not doing this and we 're not doing this that 's a no-no if you come to my pump class you 'll hear me often say arms go straight up in the air and as you extend your arms to the air your abdominals are braced squeeze your arms in to your earlobes how many is that are you counting i 'm not counting but i think that 's about eight nine and ten great jump up there you go so that workout has used every muscle in my body from my toes to my fingertips the small muscles in our hands and our toes when we step out that is a full body workout three exercises squat arm extension and shoulder press this is maria thank you for joining me for this video stay tuned because the next round of band work we 're going to take it up to another level i hope to see you soon take care of yourself thank you _"

    "text": "if you feel elasticity just close your eyes makefully for i see you everywhere winding roads all these mountains i have climbed all these dark and dusty roads you there 's a spotlight shining down on you there 's a river keen for the pleasing there 's and i 'm praying that it 's true i pray there 's a lot there 's a way about you there 's a spotlight shining down you please hey there folks my name is edo that was a song called there 's a light and you 're currently watching this as i perform in my house we call this the treehouse studio as you can see the lovely trees behind us and uh i 'd also like to take this moment to acknowledge the traditional custodians of this land to the goringa people pretty much respects past present and emerging so i 've got a lot of uh lyrics here as these songs are all new um i 've read most of these songs poster covered and as we all know it 's been a time of great change and reflection and songwriting me through that so i hope in some way you find some comfort and light in them today this song 's called miles away and it 's about uh reflections on uh being in contact with someone overseas and trying to get a long-distance relationship happening which i 'm sorry some of you have either done before or attempting at the moment it 's been a while since you 've been gone trying to find my feet over sandstorm find a way to make it so many people walking in and out of day to day it 's a family i pray for even more won 't you strengthen me to stay on the road now it hasn 't been too very long and we 've only spoken on the phone and we 're miles away miles away from coast to coast hey so many people walking in and out of day to day it 's family i pray for even more i 'll play hide and seek learn won 't you strengthen me been very long and we 've only spoken on the phone and they 're miles away away miles away from coast to coast whisper in the leaves the shadows often speak to me strangers in the night appealing come on just head on but really i don 't understand really is lay down turned into the garden of my thoughts and time deeds always looking for relief and sense you simplicity coming home guns simplicity is so that song was called head on home actually uh wrote that song in the next song in nashville in 2017 when i went there for a music city pilgrimage of sorts i went to nashville in new york and um again these lyrics uh lay here for me as i actually haven 't performed these songs a lot of these songs live ever and i thought this was a fitting way to share them in this new era that we 're in um that song was inspired by a couple of gentlemen who came up to me begging me for money and was a strange position to be in as a foreigner on a street on a mate luckily i was on a main road but um naturally i um i gave them some money we hung out a bit and yeah it was just a song that kind of came out of the streets and wandering the bars of nashville and so is this next one which is kind of a different tone it 's got a bit of a blues country flavor to it it 's called where we land and uh i 'm kind of uh making fun of myself a bit in this one about how i don 't really drink whiskey and women don 't drink women i don 't drink whiskey um i said women because the first line of this song is whiskey and women so basically i 'm trying to say i don 't really fit the cliche about uh being a country singer or a blue singer but it 's a new hero and uh this song is born of that it 's called where we land risky women has never been high on the radar desired asking me i love a good coffee exotic spicy early in the morning then after the breeze now home bread and good company i met you online seems like everyone 's been meeting there these days something between us clicked something felt just right something about the shimmering and those sweet selling eyes so while i 'm in town will you walk with me i promise to keep you in good company just and see where we live do do last time i met you i met you online seems like everyone 's been meeting there these days something between us clicked something felt just right something about those women now in those sweet southern good company just lend me your hand all in your mind just let me know let me know just let me know send me your hand down see where we land so uh there are a couple of tunes i wrote in nashville the home of country music of course um i really love country music if you haven 't figured that out by now of course i love blues and uh soul and folk and uh getting to nashville was a a real treat this next song is um it 's called it enough is enough it collaboration with a uh a friend and a wonderful singer called jay mcrae um i started writing this song following the death of george floyd and uh whilst it 's a controversial issue and uh it certainly stirred a lot in a lot of people myself included and this song came out of that so i 'll just let the song do the talking shout out to jade who wrote the second verse in this song it 's good enough is enough it 's plain to see this is more than just another tragedy it 's plain to in the some supremacy doesn 't justify the consequence when we cease to reinforce an old defense we must be brave and tall to heal the hopelessness it 's plain to me fill the world okay should never ever be atrocities and cries beyond repair and no one was there and honesty will help us look inside and see a world we need to build a road to change and so we don 't repeat the past again we must the hopelessness so and i know i 'm not the only one i don 't is is the only ones how many nights must i sleep on my own how many nights but to kneel down and pray how many nights till you 're till you 're there beside me how many nights must i hungry into the oceans how many stars must i catch in my sleep are you aware that i 've been praying forever foreign how many knives must i sleep on my own how many nights must how many nights in your how many nights must i hungarian so this uh next song is from an album that i released many many moons ago an ep actually an ep called toying the lion and this is the title track from it i wrote this song doing a piano track for a friend 's album by a band called the falls we 're now based in the states and um i like telling this story because sometimes when you play a new piano and a real piano chords and melodies kind of jump out at you um it 's like the chords and the melodies are just kind of came out of that me it 'll be okay love he 's got a heart as deep as the ocean as big as the sky and i hope it finds you just a little prayer turn into a tell shelter us again i met a girl with around now i 'm building bridges you gotta work now to make your fortune have a family in a happy house yeah here 's a little prayer and i hope it finds you just a little prayer turn into a deal huge wash away the tears wash away the worries shelter us again just a little breath just a little prayer just you could be the storm in the silence can 't you be my fire tonight he could be up above in a blanket of blue my wife there are no doubt that there are things are changing so much joy when i 'm next to you and all the ladders that i 'm climbing giving me a better we all got a dream that would such a treasure just to be alive so many people are so much joy when i 'm climbing giving me and there 's no doubt that

some birds climb across the globe we all are casualties while the leaders do their it seems the stage remains it feels like we 're living through a wall with just a clever face how can i explain how much you mean to me and all how can i convey through this melody to me somehow you 're always there to be alive for me although the darkness somehow you 're always there to be alive for me so you _"

cb tv the canterbury black bankstown council wonderful initiative to support original musicians so i 'm very pleased to be doing this the next song i 'm going to do is off my fifth solo album this year 2020 now what a year it 's been hey anyway this song i wrote about a young bloke who was living in a small country town one day his dad came home and told the family that he got a promotion and the family were really really happy of course but then he dropped the bombshell on the family that it meant they had to move away from their very small country town and this young bloke didn 't like that idea at all i wrote this song it 's called jack hope you like it jack was only nine when he left his town dragged along by his father 's change of mind i did not want [Music] for a place that was new did not understand the reason all right there wasn 't nothing to justify leaving his home leaving his home leaving his home behind [Music] because i ain 't calling it home the years went by for jack quickly it grew to make it live shiny and new the memory of the place he gone home he faded off somewhere in time [Music] leaving his [Music] to me not my choice to leave it behind maybe one day maybe one day maybe someday i 'll return don 't take me now cause i won 't go don 't take me now cause i don 't know anyone or anything in this place you wanna call or don 't take me out of some new place where i don 't know one single face anything already i want my home 's my home i 'm not done i 'm not done my home 's my home and i 'm not done my home 's my home and i 'm [Music] well that 's jack that was the first single i released a couple of weeks ago four or five weeks ago off my upcoming fifth solo album [Music] this next song i 'm gonna do is called only highs was off my in the moment album which i released last year 2019 in november i wrote this song about a time in my life where i was uh at a bit of an impasse with my daughter and uh there was one particular day one particular change and got better and our relationship took a turn for the best and it 's been fantastic ever since and i 'm sure there 's lots of people out there that have had these moments in relationships because relationships can be interesting at times and and sometimes difficult most of the times they 're great so i wrote this song about that particular moment it 's called only highs little darling only hides so much time is wasted in our lives miss understandings cost so much we dwell on the wrong things not the right it 's time now to move on let 's start tonight little dolly only [Music] maybe it 's only one perfect moment that it takes to share a memory of a good time to stop the ea little dolly only has no more lows and the hard times let 's decide that they go is this hope so little dolly only hides no more [Music] hey oh little darling only hides no more laws [Music] our hard times it 's time they go this is the [Music] [Music] no [Music] no more only highs think i 'll do i 'll go back to 2013 december 2013. i embarked on writing my first song for quite some years and i didn 't know where it was going to take me it 's taken me to cbtv thanks to the council at canterbury bankstown so i wrote this song in december 2013. i 'm just sitting down one lazy afternoon saturday afternoon picked out my guitar which i hadn 't picked out for a while and i wrote this song in about half an hour and what it did was it inspired me to continue to write so here i am 2020 on the eve of releasing my fifth solo album so it 's been quite a journey so this is uh quite a sentimental song to me because it 's where it all started it 's called morris it goes like this i 'll tell you who morris is at the end [Music] a lazy saturday in december waiting by the phone looking out through the front door [Music] but no one 's coming up the road [Music] the afternoon is slowly drifting by it up on the big screen i know it 's only make-believe and as i sit out back i look across [Music] and i see morris in the distance i wonder how much time he has left i wonder will he show resistance [Music] morris lives over in the distance [Music] the people who eyes are looking up at me she don 't live here anymore it 's been a while since she 's been gone i still miss a wedding by my dog i feel you he sits up on the wall watches out over everything but he don 't say very much at all i guess he waits there just pondering sometimes morris comes and feasts with me we have conversations at my back fence i wonder how much time he has left [Music] [Applause] [Music] is over the back pants [Applause] and morris lives over in the distance [Music] [Music] waiting for morris to come over [Music] to come over so i said i 'd tell you who morris was morris was a cow that lived in a paddock behind our house he used to come over to long grass out of our backyard give him a bit of a scratch behind the ear he didn 't have a name when i met him but he just looked like a morris so i called him morris that 's the story of morris very sentimental song for me [Music] i thought i might do a song called mark 758 now i wrote this song about a trail marker in a national park i was standing next to it on top of a hill one day it 's about 12 or 14 feet high and i tried to imagine what life would be like through the eyes of the trail marker and i looked up and i saw a little yellow tag it was about that long hanging down from the trail marker and on it was inscribed marker 7-5-8 which is the name of this song [Music] well i 'm standing up high on top of a hill an overcast stain not a breath of wind it takes me some time to catch back my breath from the climb [Music] in every direction i can see forever curiosity it in the life a moment in time of marker 758 [Music] majestic you stand guiding the way i 've wrong weary travelers over the day i stand next to you oh i 'm dwarfed by your size look up it 's clear in my mind how long [Music] how long will you stay oh how long will you stay [Music] you carry the scars and the names of a few that stop for a while to stand beside you see what you see feel what you feel if they can battered and bent from your days on the hill it 's stronger than time such as your will nothing can break you not rain solar wind [Music] 758 majestic you stand guiding the way our own weary travelers over the day i stand next to you i 'm dwarfed by your size look up it 's clear in my mind how long how long will you get away how long how long we stay oh how long will you stay how majestic you stand guiding the way weary travelers over the damn well i 'm next to you standing strong mind how long how long will you guide way how long how long will you [Music] how long will you stay will you stay oh how long will you stay in well i 'm standing up high on top of a hill an overcast day not a breath of wind um fall down i wrote a song about my house falling down i called it fall down and let 's try again from the perspective of the house didn 't know didn 't see couldn 't tell reality falling down on the edge digging deep desperately worse and worse by the day open up all the way i 'm a risk insecure breaking up reassured me up make me strong so i don 't come crashing down make me feel safe and secure me so i don 't fall down [Music] don 't fall down [Music] don 't fall down sinking down feeling low not sure how long hold on need someone lift me up get my feet back on the ground lift me up make me strong so i don 't come crashing down make me feel safe and 't fall down don 't fall down i don 't wanna fall down i understand you didn 't see a blind side i agree now it 's time to repair need your help to fix me lift me up make me strong so i don 't come crashing down make me feel safe and secure me so i don 't lift me up make me strong so i don 't come crashing down make me feel safe and she killed me so i don 't fall down don 't fall down i don 't wanna fall down so i don 't fall down um a few years ago went to morocco and while we were there we met three really interesting guys one of them we met in marrakesh one in sali and one in chef chowan and when i got back to australia i wrote this song this worked this song about those three uh gentlemen it 's called gentleman joe goes like this joe is a gentleman his intention 's true wrapped in an ancient maze colored in sky blue saturn shared some history of his life and but time was moving on solly m could talk at a hundred miles an hour [Music] interest in everything he was passionate he was proud doesn 't understand what 's happening today he believes that it has to change it cannot stay this way it 's such a shame we 're conditioned to see the worst of everything it 's such a shame we overlook all the good there is to see i believe i believe there 's something so wrong so wrong and i believe i believe it could be something so strong it could be so strong i think i 've known it all along [Music] soleil was interesting and true quit with a story not sure how many were true selling you the world but you wanted something to [Music] take the shirt from your back your wallet or your shoes such a shame we 're conditioned to see the worst of everything it 's such a shame we overlook all the good there is to see him and i believe i believe there 's something so wrong so wrong and i believe i believe it could think i 've known it all along i think i 've known it all along i think i 've known it all along and it 's such a shame we 're conditioned to see the worst of everything it 's such a shame we overlook all the good there is to see and i believe i believe there 's something so wrong so wrong i believe i believe it could be something so strong it could be so strong that i believe i believe there 's something so wrong so wrong and i believe i believe it could be something so strong so strong believe it believe it believe it believe it [Applause] [Music] could be something so strong and i know if joey here would sit you down and tell you about his life tell you about his family tell you about his beliefs his children his wife and sally anne with all his passion and pride he 'd want you to see him want you to

    "text": "hi everyone my name is hayden and i 'm from the active canterbury bankstown program here at council so today i 'm at the wiley park outdoor gym equipment where we have teamed up with new south wales health and the southwestern sydney local health district for today 's cbtv video an exercise physiologist from new south wales health has written out a program based on all of the equipment here giving you some tips and tricks to make the most out of your workouts there is also a brochure with all of this information which you can download from the link in this video let 's get into it so to start off today we have a couple of warm-up options for you guys uh the first one here is the cross trainer so what we 're going to do we 're just going to stand steadily on the machine and we 're going to take our hands and grip them on these two front bars uh what we 're gonna do next is just to slowly start moving in a walking or cycling motion so alternating between your off nice and slow and then slowly build up uh maintaining our grip on the front here and we 're going to maintain a smooth forward motion as well so if you 're a beginner you 're looking at maybe one to two minutes to warm up for intermediates three to five and if you 're in advance on this equipment maybe around six to ten minutes okay just a couple of training tips as well if you 're not feeling very tired just increase the rate of motion speed things up a bit and that 'll be sure to get the heart pumping and also if you have any balance issues it might be best to avoid this machine so our second option for uh warm up is to use this recumbent bike uh so what you 're gonna do you 're just gonna take a seat just like this make sure your back is nicely supported uh with the backrest here and then you 're just going to put your feet up on the pedals like so and we are just going to start pedaling in a forward can build it up once you get comfortable with the motion so we have a couple of training tips as well for this one it 's for a greater challenge you can actually increase the rate of movement so go as quick as you can for maybe one minute and then 30 seconds at a slower pace to recover okay and that 's going to get your heart rate up and down a little bit and it will be a greater workout for you if you have any knee or hip issues probably a good idea just to be careful on this one as well as it may flare things up all right that 's it for warm up guys let 's get into the other equipment so the next piece of equipment we 're gonna look at is the hand bar okay so pretty simple one we just want to take a seat uh like so keeping our feet shoulder-width apart again uh and for this one just make sure your back is up nice and straight we don 't want to be hunched over because that could cause position take hands of the handles here and just start slowly moving them forward until you 're comfortable with the motion and then you can start speeding things up a bit okay so if you 're a beginner maybe look at doing this just for 30 seconds um intermediates more like a minute and for advancing you can go for two minutes without stopping it is pretty challenging i 'm confident you guys will be able to do it also just another general tip if you want a greater challenge similar to the to the bike over there we can speed things up and you can go as hard as you can for periods of 10 to 20 seconds and then slow it down for your recovery and then you can speed it up again and slow it down and as i mentioned before to get your heart rate up and down and it 'll mean a tougher workout for you guys so the first piece of strength equipment we 're going to look at today is the seated row so as you can see i 've just taken a sure my back is up against the backrest nicely supported so we don 't do any damage there we want our shoulders to be relaxed as well okay and our feet are going to be planted on the floor directly in front of us in line with our shoulders uh so once you 've done all that you can just take a grip of the hand grips here you can choose either one personally i prefer these ones so i 'm going to go with that one and then what we 're gonna do take a deep breath in and as we pull back we 're gonna breathe out so as we release we 're gonna breathe in so it keeps in line with your breath um yeah so if you 're a beginner i recommend about eight to ten reps and you can do two sets of that two intermediates maybe ten to twelve reps uh and you can repeat that three times and for advanced uh anywhere from 12 to 20 reps with uh three sets as well okay all right so here we have the chest press your back up against the back support as always and our feet are shoulder width apart okay so once you set up take control of the bar like this nice and firm grip you want to take a deep breath in as you push out you want to exhale and as we come back we want to inhale okay so just give that a go like this all right and to make things harder on this one as well you can lift your feet off the ground to engage your core it does make things a bit more tricky or just really slow the movement down as well okay so similar to the other ones we 've been doing um if you 're a beginner on this try eight ten reps for two sets um and if you 're an intermediate try ten to 12 for three sets and if you 're in advance see if you can do 15 to 20 for three sets as well okay and just be careful if you have any shoulder problems it might be best to avoid this one all right all right so similar to our shoulder press we 're just going to take a seat on the chair make sure our back is upright against the back support feet shoulder width apart okay once you 're set up grab these bars i can choose either these ones or these ones i prefer these ones because it really targets the lats more um take a nice firm grip and a deep breath in and once you 're ready pull up and as you 're pulling up you want to exhale and as you 're releasing on the way back down you want to inhale okay so just like this and to make things harder same as the shoulder press machine guys lift your feet off the floor and cross them to activate the core uh alternatively keep things nice and slow on the way back down okay so for beginners eight to ten reps uh with two sets intermediates it 's 10 to 12 reps with three sets and for advanced see if you can do 15 to 20 uh with three sets as well and just be careful same thing again best to avoid this one uh so we 're at the shoulder press machine now guys so just take your seat on the chair make sure your back is nice and straight and supported by the back support uh and we want our feet sort of aligned with our hips and shoulders so everything is nice and straight what you can do now is take a grip of these bars so you can choose either this one or this one i 'll do this one for now and what you 're going to do take a deep breath in and like our other pieces of equipment we 're going to exhale on the way up and then inhale on the way back down so just like this to make this a little bit harder if you want it what you can do is lift your feet off the ground and that 's going to activate your core muscles as well or what you can also do is make sure you 're coming down nice and slow okay so that 's just a couple things that 'll make it harder just one guys probably best not to do it and yeah if you 're a beginner try for eight to ten reps and two sets uh if you 're an intermediate try for 10 to 12 with three sets and for an advance we want 12 to 14 reps with three sets as well all right so the next piece of equipment we have are the leg raise here so we 're going to do to come and stand with your back against the back support here like this and then lay your arms down on these bars here and take a grip of whatever feels most comfortable i prefer these outer ones here okay so nice firm grip then what you 're going to do is slowly raise your legs off the ground taking your body weight through your elbows and hands and then we are going to slowly raise our feet off the ground bringing our knees to our chest and as we do that we 're going to exhale and then on the way down we 're going to inhale so just like this all right if you try and keep your knees straight and bring them up parallel to the ground so that 's going to make things a bit harder like so or another way you can do it is bring your legs up and start doing a scissor motion like this so that 's gonna make it even harder for you guys okay so if you 're a beginner on this one i try and do six to eight reps and two sets for an intermediate it 's eight to ten with three sets and if you 're in advance see if you can do 10 to 12 sets reps and three sets as well okay so for the next station we 're going to look at both the pull-up and the assisted pull-up machine uh and it 's basically your choice based on your uh experience level with this sort of equipment um without the assisted version it is a lot harder so just be wary of that but i 'll show you how to do both regardless so to start off with this is the unassisted pull-up so we 're just going to up here you can either do it like this the under grip which is going to work your bicep muscles a bit more or the over grip which is going to work the muscles in your back a little bit more so what you do you 're just going to slowly pull yourself off the ground and bring your chin up to the bar there so you want to breathe out as you 're pulling up and then breathe in as you 're slowly uh releasing pulling down okay so that 's it for that one if you 're a beginner maybe see if you can do six to eight reps uh and see if you can do two sets of that if you 're an intermediate maybe more like eight to ten uh with three sets and for intermediates 10 to 12 reps with three sets as well so we 'll move over to the assisted works a similar way but we 're just gonna stand on this bar here okay and that 'll take some of the body weight uh so we 're not pulling ourselves completely up grip at the top again and then you 're just gonna do it the same way so breathe out as you pull up and breathe in as you release okay so this one 's a little bit easier so if you 're a beginner you can do eight to ten reps uh and two sets of that intermediates it 's ten to twelve uh and try three sets and for advanced it is 12 uh to 20 and you can try three sets as well so for our last machine of the day guys we have the leg press machine um so it 's set up similar to the other piece of equipment take a seat your back nice and tall against the support and then what you 're going to do is just lift your feet up to the platform and try and keep them shoulder width apart okay and then we 're just going to be extending our knees nice and slow and as we do that we 're going to exhale and then inhaling on the way back down okay so to make things harder on this it harder yeah and if you 're a beginner try eight to ten reps two sets intermediates is ten to twelve reps for three sets and advanced uh see if you can do 15 20 and three sets as well okay also if you have any hip or knee pain it might be best to avoid this one all right well that 's it for all the strength exercises today guys but to finish off we 're gonna do some stretches uh to make sure we 're not pulling up too sore tomorrow okay so the first one is a calf stretch so you just want to be standing with your feet apart like this with your toes facing forward and if you want to hold on something help your balance that 's also a good idea and then you just want to bend your front knee slightly and straighten your back knee and you should feel it through your calf muscle here okay let me swap it over like that okay we want to hold that for 20 seconds each leg and probably repeat once for each leg as those okay the next one is going to be a hamstring uh stretch so the best thing to do is take your seat so i 'll sit here like this and then we have one knee bent but we straighten out the leg that we 're going to stretch like this and then we 're simply just going to reach forward and touch our toe okay and keep breathing while you 're doing these stretches guys it 's really important not to hold your breath keep breathing nice and slow try and hold that for 20 seconds and then change legs hold that for 20 seconds and then we 're going to do a repeat as well so repeat for each leg okay ah the next one we 're going to do is a quad stretch so stand up next to a pole or something you can hold on to like this uh and then we 're just gonna stand nice and straight feet close together lift up one of our legs and pull back just like this okay pull back and you should feel the stretch through your muscles then change leg so you can jump over to this side to make things a bit easier like that repeat on each leg as well so do two sets of those uh and the last one we 're going to do is a chest stretch for our chest muscles we need a lot of upper body today so we want to make sure we 're stretching out these muscles as well so what you 're going to do just stand still up nice and straight grip your hands behind your back and what you 're going to do is push your hands towards the floor then bring your chest out like this okay and you can hold that for 20 seconds make sure you keep breathing just like this keep breathing and then repeat that as well so 20 seconds off have a bit of a rest and repeat again okay well that 's it for today 's video guys i thank you for joining us i hope you enjoyed the content and i hope that you 've taken something out of

    "text": "hi everyone my name is maria thank you for joining me on cbc tv for this short video and the first two videos that i 've presented to you using a band we 've worked on legs and we worked on some core and the second one incorporated legs core as well as some upper body workout today we 're going to skip those squats we 're going to skip all the shoulder presses as well we 're going to get down to our mat and we 're going to do three exercises to work our back muscles our abdominal muscles and our pelvic floor so it 's a little bit of a call work which you can do any time and you know 5-10 minutes is really all you need to effectively work those areas that we need for them to stay strong to support our body support our spine having a strong back muscles we also it 's very important for our daily activities as well as of course in the gym when you visit our center at canterbury aquatic leisure center but it is also equally important abdominal muscles so if ever you do a workout for the core for the abs make sure that you do equal amount of work for the back as well as the front it 's often something i see it quite a lot in in balance we overwork abdominals we underwork our core at our back extensors and that can lead to potential injuries in your spine so something for you to really think about in your exercise regime and whatever that goal is for you so today three exercises you need your mat maybe a towel yeah that will be fine but a towel to add more cushioning you can double up the mat if you find lying down the mat uncomfortable and a bottle of water and as always please work at your own pace slow it down stop you can pause the video anytime and start it again and modify it to suit you so that you are working hard and playing safe and check with your doctor to make sure that you are clear to do any of these exercises on the videos you 've got to all right so let 's get started i 've already got a band around my knees as you can see and today i 'm choosing the red one which is sort of in between them very hard and the very easy in my particular selection of weight bands but they come in many different colors generally speaking black is the hardest okay sometimes gray it just depends on what band selection that you have all right so let 's come down to the floor and the first one that we 're going to do after i do my shoelaces up i 've got these really fancy shoelaces and as you can see they stretch up and they 're really cool but they 're not the most uh efficient but let 's get started lying down on your back we 're going to take the knees over the hips and as you can see my knees are coming into the chest but we want the knees to stay there as soon as the knees are above the hips your abdominals are automatically switched on and you want to pull up through here all we 're doing is a little bit of extension out so we 've got some tension in that band there and that forces us to activate our inner thigh and then you 're simply dropping the heels towards the floor you can modify this by not taking the heels to the floor and going halfway down here 's a little trick that i 've been doing for many years and it 's super easy and it 's a great reminder of what we 're actually doing hands or fingertips place them from the hip bone about two inches towards the middle of the body now if your abdominals really push up high which they will because that 's what their job is to do they just think am i focusing on the abdominals or am i focusing on me in the core a toughie but you 've still got to be mindful of that so i 'm going to take my heels to the floor exhale remember as always i say in my videos you 've got to breathe through every single movement every repetition requires a breath because of any issues in your spine what you can do is double up a mat put an extra towel get a little pillow a little cushion and place it under your lower back so we don 't arch the spine cool that 's the first exercise put your heels down make sure you can touch the back of your shoe and that 's the alignment that you can you want knees to hip with the pump zip up the abdominals eyes to ceiling take a deep breath in as we lift the hips and then slowly bring the back down this is our very common bridge and something that i do see a lot of is this i call this the fast and the furious and it is very counter productive so always think full range if you can and go at a pace that is safe speed does not produce more efficient output unless we 're talking about running or fly matrix okay but even then you still want to do every single movement through the full range if possible and with the best technique that you can hips stay below my knee yep if you want to go a little bit higher that 's fine remember the higher that you go there 's more pressure on your vertebrae and more pressure on your hips so you just keep that in mind and choose the one that 's right for you right that will do for now good keep your knees over the hips extend the legs out a little bit so we 've got some tension in that band and from here rock and roll up into an abdominal crunch you can place one hand you can place both hands behind have a look at the lower leg lower leg is parallel to the floor the lower leg has not dropped okay that 's just not good posture that 's not effective and that 's not really being safe this is harder absolutely but it is definitely worth it four three two one have a rest so we have worked our back muscles we have with some pelvic floor muscles and we 've worked abdominals and core we 've got all of that really important area working make this rocket science let 's get started from the top ten of each all right ten nine relax the shoulders try not to squeeze up or shrug the shoulders to the ears right keep the knees above the hips how do you know if they 're above the hips what you do is you extend your arm completely out that palm should tap the knee if the arm bends you know the knees are too close in right so you 've got a straight line from the shoulder to the wrist and you know that is the position you want your knees to finish cool and inhale bridge 10 inhale exhale you may remember from my earlier videos that i said to you that you know breathing is really important and for the bridge we inhale to lift and we exhale to come back down now in yoga we breathe nose to nose and that 's wonderful but here we just want to maintain steady rhythmical breathing in through nose and out through mouth if you can you know breathe those nose that 's super cool there 's no between the thighs and crunch one hand two hands no hands look towards your knees don 't look up look towards knees gently tuck in the chin four three two one rest that 's round two we 're going for three rounds and that will take you about five to ten minutes now people say i don 't have time to exercise um you know what we have all 24 hours of the day and it 's a little strange out there with all the things happening with covert but we can all give 10 minutes to look after our body to keep it healthy to keep it moving and minimize the chances of injury and stay spit and stay strong we 've all got 10 minutes to do something make a cup of coffee you 're waiting for your coffee squad you 're bending the bending down to pick something up off of the floor squad you 're on the floor doing something at home do some push-ups really 10 minutes we all have 10 minutes team let 's go and 10 nine squeeze the shoulder blades down to mat it 's not a super fancy you know patented design doesn 't have a brand on it you don 't have to have an expensive mat you can use towels you just have to have something on the floor to support your back make sure the back isn 't arching all right here we go bridge inhale exhale inhale exhale inhale exhale i 've got some music playing in the background i 'm not sure if you can hear it but uh if you carry it lady marmalade and if you can 't just imagine it 's music in the background three more one i 'm not sure that 's ten i tend to lose count you know it could be thirty before you know it but not today all right knees over hips we 've got tension in the band ready set 10. oh good job so that 's your workout for today three exercises for back and core and abdominals take a little stretch let 's do it together lose the band knees to chest rock them around in any direction massaging the lower back relax the palms down knees to one side let them fall to the side however they fall is good inhale knees to the center knees to the other side now if your shoulder lifts up on the opposite side of the body that 's fine i mean you know you want to try and stretch and lengthen that your shoulder stays down that might be a little bit difficult for you which is fine you can also place the hand on the top of the knee and press down very gently and then resist that stretch by reaching through your fingertips all right team rock and roll forward hands to knees curve the spine exhale inhale exhale and there you go well that 's it for me for today take care of yourself have an amazing day bye from maria _"

    "text": "of our stair lane lovers i 'll be back for some more of my kitchen rules the seas you clicked it you get what you deserve and deny it i 'll be making for you let 's be episode two three three i think two three three tonight i 'll be making view buccaneer pork and charred pineapple salsa sounds good i even broke out me caribbean coconut so i looked all apart quite a bit more variety because i 'm picking a few rings because i thought it was already probably not a good look there still new to this cooking my lucky game here i want to teach you what to do so i figure i 'll go with that like that so we still want a bit of a variety there here and we still got oh wilson over here we first wait there keep an annoying thing so he 'll make sure we go off and safety and everything 's you know tickety-boo as i say so i figure another thing i should be doing in these things is tell you what 's in them at you get the ending of what what i uh or do you think that look good but i 'm not gonna make it right so what do you need right well you need some oil oil and butter right we talked about those things before right and you need some pork mints right so pork mince we 're using pork mints right you know you can go buy your pork mince or you could put it through a block and tackles and crunch it all down like that if you 've got a pig on board and all that kind of stuff it 's up to you which you want to go with right and you need it 's going to be made with royce this dish so we 're going to make it with bells maddie right basmati rice right that 's maddie right which is actually a hindu word i don 't know how that got into a caribbean meal but you know that 's what it is basmati rice i mean basmati actually baz in hindi means aroma and maddie means lots of or so lots of right but the trick with coke and basmati rice sake and with all rice i 'll show you how you cook up the other but with this one if you want to get the starch out right so what you do is you get your rice in a bucket or bowl or whatever right you fill it up about this much extra the water then you actually got rice in there and you slush it round right slosh it round empty it out you do that about three or four times then you start off will be all milky right but by the end it 'll look clear and you pour it out and that 's when you know you 're done what that does it gets all that extra starch out right so you don 't have that grumpy rice when there and also when you boil your water out all together you let it absorb all the water so you don 't sort of drain it or strain it or anything like that because that upsets those people that eat rice all the time because they don 't try and do it the right way all right but a good good trick with the basmati rice okay is actually to give it a good rinse off all right three or four times is good you 'll be able to tell when you first do it the water will be all cloudy right and then we do the last time well it 'll be clear and all that sort of stuff all right so we 'll even have a look at that bit later on all right so plus what do we got we got a zucchini right we 're gonna grate this zucchini it 'll be different that 'll be great all right we got a couple of these old capsicums right capsicum cucumbers sorry cucumbers cats are gonna be another dish and a couple of tomatoes right this is how you all going into our pineapple salsa charred pineapple sauce which means we need a pineapple see that good old-fashioned pineapple right i mean you could use a canned one what you tell if they 're fresh is if they pull out easy like that right the easy that means they 're fresh all right so what we 're going to do is we 're going to chop that up into small bits all right so you know we got all that copic cooking involvement down here as well we 've got the breadboard we 've got the wooden spoon and we 've got our covers so we 'll be taking care of business very soon all right sorry girls just so you don 't say it right all right plus we need a lot him all right remember last time we had the lloyd with lemon last time this time was a lawyer the green ones right same deal all right we 're going to give that we 're going to zest it right remember the zesting right i can show you all right zesting remember you can use one of those little fine graters or whatever that kind of stuff that or just the edge of your cutlass right just a sharp edge this be a closer look curry it wasn 't quite working the other way closer look at what it looks like that of lemon warning this is loima and that was lemon got it got it good that 's it all right he comes off a little bit it 's like that you can see that bit of my fingers there like that oh there we go just dropped a bit over to that it 's all in after you 've got that right you 've got your line there 's all you know looking a bit ratty because you 've taken all the skin off it now we just take the cutlass to it we give it a good hack all right just hack straight down cut it in two right because once you 've got two arms right then once you 've done that you can uh squeeze them in later right so the juices right because that 's what you want to do a bit of squeezer juicer all right put that aside that pineapple we 're hacking open all that kind of stuff all right we got mint all right mint just some mint from the garden right we 're going to rough cut that up all right right this is they use a lot of garlic in this one so it 's like six cloves in there right about six or seven cloves of garlic a plus remember me bag right for the old uh baby spinach so got a big lot of that we 're gonna rough cut that up as well and we 'll stir that in later as well all right so i think that 's about all the beginnings of all the stuff oh what else we got right what gives us the flavor what makes it buccaneer and what is a buccaneer you say what is a buccaneer all right it 's got nothing to do with the side of me head all right what is a buccaneer well i can tell you right now a buccaneer it was an early name for a pirate it 's actually the caribbean pirates all right that 's why this dish comes with the caribbean all right but what was kaiser word bucan all right which is actually like a cooking device right basically like a barbecue is dry and their meats and all that the caribbean right in the 1700s they used to go around and they get wild beef right they kept them down and they used a bouquet to actually cook it up and they 'd know they were there on the side of the beach when those boats were sailing through and they 'd see the fires of them on the beach when they 're doing their meets and stuff like that and they noticed the eclair and that kind of stuff and that 's how they got the name the buccaneers are basically the barbecues it 's pretty much australians were the parts were they but that 's what buccaneers were the bugattis all right let 's be a french wood of course all right now what we 're having on our pork is called jerk seasoning jerk which doesn 't sound nice as a seasoning but basically it just means that any kind of a food right that 's actually green coated in spices all right courses and spices like beef jerky that 's is in the same family is that kind of stuff like that so the spices right which is the this place the covering that we 'll put over the in through the meat and all that give it all the flavor and stuff like that right and so you know so let me just voices the spices we have right are sweeper picker right uh all spice garlic powder our nutmeg and cajun pepper cayenne pepper all right so that 's right that gives it spice and cayenne pepper you 'll vary how much you want to put in because that 's where the real cake comes in there right there it says all right and we 'll have some salt and pepper of course and that kind of stuff we 'll mix them all together and then we 'll mix that in with alcoholics and that should be the jerk flavoring for our buccaneer pork haha and charred pineapple all right i 'll just have a hang of this pineapple and then we 'll head up and do the rest of our prep off of the deck we 'll be doing most of our cooking we don 't like stoves down here in the rolled down here in the room here on the bilge and all that might catch fire and all that sort of stuff and it 's all wood everywhere and it 's a bit scary right so we 'll just hack up the particle here and then i 'll let up right but don 't you go changing because we 'll be back after these messages we 'll be back right now all right there you go slice it off now we 'll be cutting down the edges here like that oh cutting down the edges all sides and then just get a nice little bit so you can clean up to cook right don 't want any of that skin on there right there so chop it up into small bits so ready to be barbecuing up lovely pineapple there full of vitamin c and k which are good good good good vitamins there for you know getting your immunity up and uh saving you from scurvy and vitamin k is good because it clots the blood and as a pirate you want to be old but clot your blood 're good for the things boys besides cooking i see anyway that 's pineapple lovely stuff so we 're cooking up some basmati rice all right but about a cup of basmati rice you 'll need three cups of water when you 're actually doing the cooking so it 's one to three right to actually cook it up properly get it all absorbed but first we 're going to rinse it off like we don 't all right so just add some water all right all right so you just basically just cover it swish it about right just swish it about should go see how cloudy that water is that 's the starch coming out right so we get all that starch out right so we do that about three times all right three times and the fourth tournament should be pretty clear but look at that water there you can see that water it 's a bit cloudy right just wash that around right and i 'll come back after three more times all right we 're back for the fourth time can you see that it so that 'll keep the royce will be light and fluffy because a lot of the starch is out right because the starch is what makes it gloopy but we don 't want it gloopy we want it light and fluffy because we 're fluffy pirates ah right with the garlic that we jumped ahead and all the other chocolate really because you know you see me wheel me cutlers around areas are getting a bit slimy and all these different videos so i think it 'll mix up a bit but i just want to go over the garlic thing again right remember the easiest way to garlic get it to peel right if you 're going to cut it up just lean your blade on it like that so when you crush it right skin as you crossed it right comes right off see easy bit of a crush with your blade skin comes right off all right any blade will do it especially a cutlass all right and then you just cut it up fine like the rest of it there right so we just cut it see we 've ah what they call this is called greeting right and you can use a great arrow to grate these up so you 've got nice clean streets right because it gets cooked up with the pork a bit later right or you can do it like we do and if you 've got a weird bomb because we 've got weird bob and uh we use these teeth because he our surgeon when he got his teeth knocked down him just use the broken tips of uh cutlasses to make his teeth but he made him slightly protruding right so they just hang out over his lips so he can run the old zucchini against his teeth and sort of drops down in the bowl below and it gives it a unique sort of flavor as well but uh you could just use a grater but for me i can 't go past using with bob 's teeth uh right so this be the mixture for our jerk spicy mix all right okay so first up you got your cayenne pepper right so you don 't want a teaspoon right just enough to get you going all right then we 've got a paprika right all right that 's about a bit over a tablespoon there i need to go with it right and this be a garlic powder so that 'd be two tablespoons of garlic powder for my special mix right and about a tablespoon of nutmeg all right and then we finish off with the allspice that 's about a tablespoon as well that 's sort of the mix we 've got here right to give ourselves like blenders spices to get that sort of buccaneer flavors coming through right and we 're just going to add that to the mints in a moment thank you right so you 've got a medium-sized pan right that you have a lid for right you need one that you can actually put lid on to seal it up right all right into that pan yeah the butter remember i told you that 's a butter right so just break that off with the old don 't wait very disinfected with englishman 's blood as it is 's get that melt right get the bit of milk on that a little bit of whale oil in there as well just to splash into that heady brew right we add about half of alcohol right about half of it need some more later and about half there right you let that get all aromatic all right get that in there it 's an all aromatic roy and you see that 's been going for about a minute or two right so now we got our royce right remember it 's been ripped soft alright in there that 's a copper rice to which we add three cups of water all right three cups of water now we bring that to the boil right right once the rice is boiled right boiling like that and you reduce your heat right down again right right down to low right and then cover with a lid right you let it simmer all that low for about 10 minutes then remove it from the heat right you keep it covered and then and the rice will go tender right and the water and tender absorb and that 'll take a further 10 minutes or so right so you just leave that to sit aside and just does its own business okay but for now it 's just on low for 10 minutes right off the heat low for 10 minutes now with that rice is doing this business we 're going to sort out a bit more a little bit more whale oil just a pan and these are our chunks all right they didn 't really matter what they look like they 're chunks of pineapple right just chunks of pineapple quite toasty all right but we 're going to cook them up all their sweet pineapple actually very nice so we 're throwing them on there right notice we cut out all the black bits nothing nothing that 's away there beautifully beautifully cut pointable nice and fresh you could use canned stuff for this if you want to go cans or you yeah let 's see that 's all you got but we use fresh because we 're in the caribbean so there we go now we 're just it all up oh you can see there they 're charring up nicely see that there nicely chair tie it up so in a minute i 'll be transferring them to vista where in this bowl already releasing bowl just rough cut them off a bit right so they 're just the smaller little chunks nice chunky charred chunks gives us that charlie flavor yeah pineapple salsa right and uh then i 'll be just getting on to the mints right all right right so it 's been about 10 minutes so i 've taken the rice off the heat now it 's just out in there with a lid still on right it 's just absorbing all the rest of that water so it comes out nice and light and fluffy the meantime i 'm adding a bit more of my whale oil right in it 's time to cook the pork wait got ourselves some pork mince nice and healthy nice and healthy pork mince right throwing that in there like that good to that we 're going to add our bikini all right lovely bikini there we moist and brown cooking all that up right around the oil until it 's fully cooked see while you cook it right you stir it around and break up the bits of mince right so they 're nice and fine you see that i 've got a nice little texture right you know the lumps of meat filled through it yeah a nice pulling porky mint i 'm just screwing that all through get nice and cooked through nice and brown get it all ready all right that 's just finishing off there you 'll see just finished i 'm gonna add the rest of the garlic there right that 's that finely cut garlic in there garlic aromas all around it really screw them in get them cooking up freshen up there you like smelly garlic there a little bit of body and now remember all our spices we 're going to try the spices here right tools voices right wow forces me treasures them out of eve and dutch traders and a lot more stickers love stealing the spices off and get a good market for it right adding it all in there right all in all those lovely mix of spices create a jerk mixing that all in there let 's get normal coating remember the dirt is about coating all that mince all right coating it all with those spices lovely voices yeah mix it around so you know those flavors are mixing together probably spicy rollers you can see it all mixing in there right you see all that mix it in we don 't want it to be like dry it 's not like we 're making salted beef here is it right a little bit more flavor so what we do to do that we 're just gonna make a bit more saucy right by adding a bit of water right who 'da thought ordered me make something saucy but there you go now you know all right it 's the sauces it gets around here i 'll tell you all right here we go just get that mixing in there and just keep you need to add a little bit more water out a bit more water just depending on what you that all right just keep cooking that through as we go and there you go you see i added a little bit more water just to make it a nice little bit runny you can see how lovely brown and i was all coated that 's just about right by the large number zucchini there but you know that lady the flavor that 'd be like the bonus you know the one that gets the sixth sixth shape bit of zucchini there all right but that 's nice that 's gonna sit on that rice right noise there all right i think we 'll just do the uh charred pineapple saucer and we 're ready to plate up excellent right it 'd be time for our charred pineapple salsa right so as you can see we 've rough cut up some i 'm not quite as rough as other just rough cut up the point up all right it 's nice and charred hold it like that now we add our other ingredients remember your tomato just rough tomorrow right your cucumber your mint rough cut and your zesty loin just mix all that in there right right and to that mixture right all right so i 'm just mixing that in right we want just a dash of oil right which again could be olive or whale like i used to use whale because it 's around where we run into just a little drizzle of that right we squeeze in some lime juice right that 's it good lime juice all right squeeze all that in there oh yeah that squeeze her out like that okay mix that all together lovely salsa there and that would be a gorgeously colorful looking apple poison charred pineapple saucer look at that it 's beautiful now we 've got our fluffy rice see how floppy that is fluffy and light all right let 's get all the starch out of it right to that we 're gonna add our rough cut baby spinach right we 're just gonna stir that through and lots of goodness in the baby spinach so i 've got lots of it there all right that makes you strong lots of sailors and think that makes you don 't know if he ate baby spinach or babies but you know so he mixed that it throw it as roughly makes that all through alright to give us anyways flavoursome and healthy rice right right now we get our pork just ladle that liberally on top of that there like that lovely lovely flavors all that jerk all right into that we had a salsa on top all right all right lovely look at those flavors there eh beautiful and colorful right you 're rather hard for your loyal other huffy low you just give that cut in a quarter like that there in the wedges or you know more you serve that on the side and that way people can spray a bit more lime on there if they like all right there it is lovely what we call that we call that buccaneer report buccaneer pork with charred pineapple salsa what a better voice what could be nicer than that and healthy you 'll be much much much much unlikely to be getting scurvy when you 're eating a falling dish like this ah but that day so i think i 'm just gonna whistle this off and i 'm gonna go upstairs and have a bit of a bite to eat myself because it 's been long and weary someday so we finish here all i can say is my kitchen roses e so wilson what do you think hey hi look at that oh lovely eh lovely you keep your beak out of that that 's oh i know what it dier some of the platinum needs something to be desired but it 's hard to keep when you 're at sea right and things rock the back was involved it is hard to keep things balanced on top like they do in it or the tv shows and all that kind of stuff but you get the idea of the flavors and you can plate up something your own thing when you 're not on a deck that 's moving underneath your feet all right but talking about moving underneath your feet i think it 's time i move my feet up up into the yard arms i think i 'm gonna help a bunch away at this and keep awake from this pesky bird because it 'd be the time for us to end our my kitchen rules the sea so without little to do i 'm going to pipe us all down we can go and have some boy to eat and maybe just maybe we can get a little bit of rest all right that 'll be fine [Music] that was a bit of a musical interruption and i don 't know why so wilson what do you reckon buccaneer port with charred pineapple salsa at that point i will be going to keep the way the scurvy and to keep our blood popping our cotton and cotton iron uses wooden shoes and keeps our blood at the same time it 's fantastic didn 't i tell you that but there it is all right i know some of the platinum 's needed to be desired wilson 's very picky about that kind of stuff but you know when you 're on the sea and it 's rocking backwards and forwards it 's very hard to keep these things all colors and flavors and all right that and it looks exciting and there 's a lovely disk to have there give you a taste of summer in spring ah so that 's what it 's good for a taste of summer in spring ah that 's what a buccaneer pork does for you but right now i 'll be heading up dick all right to cover some of this down and then maybe i 'll get in some oh yeah because it 's been a long and long time day out let 's see today it 's been a bit rough but we 've got through it and now it 's time for me to wipe us all down so we can enjoy this and we can get a bit of rest so i 'll be seeing meow me buckles [Music] all right i gotta go back to pipe school i think i 'll be so good look at it ah all right so i 'll be just whistling us all down now as we head off to have a bit of a nap all right all right so i gonna head off to be a nap i think i 'll take it off me but now it 's time for me to take off me caribbean cooking hat pull up me pipe and whistle us all down the bolsons whistle don 't whistle us all back down have a nap at the end of a long and tiring day [Music] i 'll be seeing you next time on my kitchen rules this is what you enjoy

want to say a huge thank you to canada rebanks town council for hosting the keep connected initiative it 's a really great way for us to not only stay connected to our art but also to stay connected to community which is so important right now i 'm coming to you from my home and uh i 've stripped everything way back because i want this to kind of feel like i 'm just playing for you in your lounge room um so you might hear the odd uh neighborhood noise um we 've got some beautiful bird life here uh but i 'm also quite close to a hospital so you know you might hear a helicopter or two as well it 's all part of the uh ambience i 'm gonna be playing a few songs off my last record which was called same skin am the fire you came like rolling thunder over the hills a chance to think this wasn 't a predictable incident [Music] unvulnerable [Music] cause i am not drumming i am the ocean i am not falling i 'm the horizon [Music] cause i am [Music] forget the tea and sympathy and pour me some wine i won 't be the best of company but you 've got my time and i 'll [Music] don 't underestimate my strength [Music] i [Music] cause [Music] oh [Music] all right uh this next song i 'm going to play for you is the title track of the album and this is called same skin dusty cover widely red tapestry so tattoos ghosts that wonder through my heart [Music] a accordingly not as bright as once i was still my hope-filled heartbeat is old and strong i 'm gonna say [Music] [Music] right it 's skin and every light as it begins [Music] [Music] [Music] say [Music] skin is [Music] trying to avoid my song still plays and i say [Music] is [Music] is light is up again hope you 're all doing um obviously in a very different social context to what we 're currently in but i feel like it 's still if anything resonates more now um than it did then and i think you 'll see why this is called if not now when it was only yesterday i said it was the best she played game off for 14 years [Music] since i seen 50 [Music] no longer will they let you stifle the voice of reason [Music] anything now but if not now [Music] she told them [Music] don 't wanna talk about this now but if not now i don 't want to hear about it now but if not now i can make the minds up about this now [Music] this breaking news the white noise will be continued so don 't adjust your mindset [Music] don 't wanna talk about this now but if not now when it hurts to think about it now but if not now when we just can 't face anything now but if not now i 'd never be the same as it is now [Music] but if not from a little bit earlier um this is one of my first album which was called fits and starts [Music] and um i actually wrote this song when i was several years ago when i was out on the road touring um with a band and i was just a player in that band we weren 't doing my stuff i was playing for somebody else and i 'd been away from home for quite a while and uh this was a song about how you kind of stay connected or share feelings of missing somebody when you 're away and obviously reflecting on that now it kind of again has a whole new meaning and new resonance it 's a love song of sorts it 's about as close to a love song as i get it 's called exit to light [Music] the watchman and his [Music] where conclusions are like hold my breath [Music] love sean on my side exit to life [Music] afraid to pray for [Music] into life [Music] i am all right i 'm going to play something new for you now um very i think i put out a new single and it was a song i wrote this year and it was very much a response to our current situation it was the first sort of time after everything had kind of happened that i 'd really had the brain capacity to kind of sit down and and somehow try and process all of this stuff it took me a while to get to that place but um this is what came out and i think this really kind of speaks to that desperate need for connection that we all have and um but hopefully you 're getting a little bit of through things like this so you can um you can seek this out on spotify and in all the usual places we actually made a beautiful um music video for this song recently with some amazing local creatives and i 'm really proud of it and i hope you like this it 's called forget me somewhere beyond the night i sometimes that whimsical featherweight child who struck a friendship with a guy then let it penetrate her heart and me to forget me this snowing feels so heavy [Music] i 'd carry the weight of the moon just to reflect [Music] away from [Music] this knowing feels so heavy so help me to [Music] unknown [Music] like i cling to you [Music] as a way that embraces the sure i 'll come questions [Music] that you might help me to forget faith [Music] help me to forget [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] me all right um there 's another one off the same skin album this one 's called slow burn tell us what 's your best i said [Music] and 20 words [Music] they just wanna sing along and it 's a bridge to fight to the chorus [Music] slow burn slow [Music] me [Music] [Music] eyes tell us your fake history in a way that 's self-deprecating aiming at the lowest common denominator [Music] rise above [Music] he shouldn 't have to do the time for such a momentary transgression you were so very distant then i just needed to feel something stop this behavior you 're making something out of nothing [Music] slow [Music] boy [Music] highs here 's another one off the album this is called paper and wood four hours if not days i 've been staring at this space [Music] i 'm almost done sucking marbles through a straw [Music] then out [Music] was it ever here at all [Music] losing patience [Music] foreign [Music] against the current i was only standing still words disappear in a cloud ubiquitous you 're barely here just enough to make [Music] is [Music] foreign [Music] we take the sky and make it us [Music] for the common good four mountains [Music] quick guitar swap again i wanted to play this song for you because uh again it was something that um came about during this uh it was actually during the kind of most restricted period when we couldn 't really go out for much at all and because of that i couldn 't get into a recording studio um the one that i usually go to and so i kind of gathered together the very meager kind of resources that i had at home and got involved in a little bit of self-production and um and up on youtube of me doing kind of playing all the parts in this next song it was a very much an experiment from my ad but it taught me that that i was capable of doing more kind of on my own than i thought i was so you know it 's you learn stuff from um when things like these happen during crisis you learn a lot about yourself and um this was definitely very much a learning moment and i call this one the undertow [Music] oops and it 's not in that key see guys you 're getting the whole experience today once and all i told you it 'll be just like i 'm in your laundry all right let 's try it in the right cave this time [Music] there 's no fight in this body tonight i surrendered a disregard cold feet all this passivity all the screams of a tired heart and i know that you know when you watch me unfold i 'm caught in the undertow it cuts deep when i 'm on my knees and your eyes keeps throwing [Music] better as you watch [Music] make me [Music] to the the undertow [Music] and i know that you know as you watch me on the phone [Applause] [Music] me in the undertow did you hear the cockatoos during that song oh the joys of suburban living um okay i think i 've maybe got one more song to play for you uh thank you so much for again for this opportunity and for anybody who 's made it this far through the set um i appreciate you being here and listening it really means a lot my name is amy v and you can find out more about me at amyv.com it 's v double e um you can also find me on spotify and on facebook and instagram and all the usual places if that 's how you roll and a huge thank you again to cannery banks town council for arranging all of this it 's a great thing that you 're doing [Music] all right this is another song with the record and this is a very uh acoustic version of this song i usually kind i thought i 'd keep it really really simple for you today stay safe out there thinking of you all and hoping that we get through all of this awfulness as soon as possible please stay connected and yeah keep yourself well this is called 10 years [Music] this reminds me of one of the stories you always [Music] but this time there 'll be no uplifting crescendo [Music] i could erase these [Music] you ten years ago ten years [Music] left to say or do [Music] [Music] and yet your heart was heavy as a sea and time doesn 't wait for the burdens to offload and take you down without cause or concern and i wish i could foresee these uneasy times [Music] you stepped into the dark just so i couldn 't see [Music] you [Music] ten years ago ten years [Music] thrown into the wind caught in the crossfire with all said [Music] ten years ago ten years ago ten years ago a shadow thank you again my name is amy v and uh all the best you _"

    "text": "[Music] here for lesson number 23 23 oh my goodness lucky 23 for some other people got so lucky but looking for some and that 's a good thing to be give me an hour that 's it today we 're celebrating number 23 by talking a story hello free exciting story about one of the more successful pirates he could ever possibly have he 's so successful as a pirate right that they have museums for him right museums talking about it and they knighted him and gave him titles and land because he couldn 't boring more than land himself but he got the titles and was politically powerful and all that kind of stuff and people think of him as a hero and an explorer but he 'd be a pirate he knows he 's a pirate he was a queen 's privateer yes sir francis drake that right he 'd be a privateer for queen elizabeth the first not that current one you got but queenless was the first and he was her man read a pirate for her he 'd steal and then they 'd privateer and that 's how we did all these big adventures we 're all due to him being a pirate that 's true and how successful is he you 're all about him he 's a hero they say but no he 'd be a pirate that 'd be right so he was born right in devon good place for pirates that 's where i come from yourself never know devon poirier at that kind of stuff right but at 10 right religious persecution right now protestants his family had to move away so they went to london right and he got a job then there 's a 10 year old working on the thames as a pilot in a pilot boat right now pilot boats they 're the ones that go out right and the party actually helps to get the ships parking right and put them in the right spots on that because arbors are all different so there 's people that know the harbours really well so when the sailor brings his big ship in the pilot will go out and he 'll help him guide and the right places to go to right that 's what a pilot does right put a little ship anyway planes that 's another story you 'll have to talk to somebody else about that right but no evia ship 's pilot he did that from 10 years old right he 's working there and they did a bit of trade like fish and stuff for all the france and all that for some wine and all that kind of wine and cheese and all those kind of things right so he did that for about 10 years when he was about 20 right the owner of that ship that he 's working on the pilot himself passed away he had no family so our wall here also francis there right he inherited it all so he could have had a life you know comfortable life was a pilot but he thought no i 'm not gonna do that and he sold up the business right sold out the business and he went and got a job with the hawkins family ah the hawkins family and they 'd be what do of the queen all right so that 's it he had that private hero would have been the king when he started hurt right so he went there and he got that job and he started working for them right and so the first job they had right is they work at where 's these privateers or down the down the coast of west africa right attacking the portuguese there are towns and airports and pillaging their boats and all sorts of things like that so he did all that kind of stuff right but in his first go right he was attacked by some spanish ships right they attacked him and they sunk his ship and he only got saved right a lot of them drowned but he could swim so he saved himself by swimming out of it right but that gave him his lifelong eater to the spanish right and then he became a thorn in their sword ever after now i bet they wish they didn 't do that after all that 'd be right i reckon all drink you would 've had a good party that 'd be right so he did that there and then he swam and all that kind of stuff but he swore vengeance off him right but then right his first victory or his first big victory right it was when he went over to the americas right he went over the americas and he went to a town there was a town called nombre diablas if that 's how you say in the spanish you type but that 's it right right this is in panama right in panama and that was a spot where they used to get the gold from peru right the gold and silver the spanish right and they take it over through on a mule train old other proper train but a train of mules all happen together right they take all that gold and silver across from the pacific side where peru is right across to the arctic so you know the other side there where they 're gonna have to go across to england and spain and all that so the spanish calendars will be there waiting for it but they had had a smart plan he had a couple of small ships right the pasture and the swan right in about 73 men and they went river right and they actually attacked him and took the train while the blue drain there where they 're there that was it they did that they left their business up but they tracked in and they attacked the town got them and it was full of gold full of gold and blades and silver and all sorts of tons and tons of gold so much they couldn 't carry it all back through the jungles and stuff and the mountains and all that so they buried up buried all part of it and then carried the rest down when they got to the beach right they got back to the beach and their ships weren 't there they 'd say they love a bit and he didn 't know what was they buried some more down on this hand right these are the original person used to bury the treasure we talked about pirates mirror treasure he was great at bearing treasure the old right so he made some rafts and they sailed out and i got there like that and they brought the ships back and i was pretty happy about that now panama right panama it 'd be a real thin bit of land right between the two oceans it holds the two americas together so don 't float away right but also you can see the ocean on both sides so what he did right is he climbed a tree and he could actually see the pacific ocean on the other side all right just by climbing a tree you can see it over there and he thought i 'm gonna sail that one day right i 'm gonna say that one day because that 's the thinnest part right a very thin amount of ground between the two bikes so much tusso in other years later on later on right they actually cut a big channel through there right through the panama they call that the panama canal right so boats can sail through there rather than sail right round through the bottom bit right on the ground the other on that right because that 's what they did also they 'd say all that kind of stuff and now right yeah we 're talking about before i tell you about cellular now they keep things simple you know we pirates we kind of like keep things simple right we don 't want to confuse you right and that 's even now technical terms like before he said to you panamax and cake zoies and handy 's always you think what 's he talking about that makes no sense to me at all but when i explain it you 'll understand it makes a lot of sense right it makes so much sense because handy 's always you look at those tankers right when you 're in the beach sometimes you can see the big ships sitting out there or you can see them coming in the harbor the big container ships that have all the stuff in them right they 're big ships big long ships right well handy size and there 's always they can just pop in and out of ports no trouble just up and down right and they call them handy because i really needed to get things around right now the next toy 's upright the bigger size is called panamax right and panamax is that 's short for the maximum size ship that can go through the panama canal see makes sense and so the other side the biggest size in that is cake size because they have to go round the cape ah makes sense in it we don 't try and fool you right we don 't try to fool ya we keep it all sensible sensible you can learn it not like the hsc stuff oh we sell stuff it just comes in and it just sticks there because we don 't like to be tricky like that kind of stuff we 're tricky when we take your money and stuff like that but when you 're trying learn stuff it 's easy stuff right so that 's where the panama are coming out kelly is so we had to look over there he thought you got a sail there and he went off that so he sailed back and and he become a hero there like that they loved him because that because he brought back whole piles of gold he gave after the to the queen and all that kind of stuff so successful right then things have settled down with the spanish a bit and they thought well we might get rid of everything you can go over and pester them around the pacific side right because the spanish used to sail around that end but the english hadn 't really gone around that way so queen says go around the other side and pester him around there and get us some treasure and stuff like that you know being the old pirate that he was he went all right all right so he sailed there with a few ships but he then eventually only got round with one half ship which was his golden horn that ended up being called like the golden orange right so we sailed right down the bottom right down around cape horn right cape horn 's the bottom of the americas right so right down the bottom right there right through he sailed around here right there and up the other side right and he was adventuring and he caught all sorts of ships and he around cape horn and he found a bit of bark there that was really good to chew if he chewed on this sort of bark he boiled it down that stuff and that was good for your scurvy so he found the things he went around and he found all ships with gold in them and he had chips with roman wine and all that kind of stuff ah he had lots of stuff he had like that he found another spanish ship that had better maps and it was oh that 's good that gave him more chance he knew where he was going right because he took their maps and all that and i told you and one of those other ones about treasure we talked about treasure i told you about how good treasure was how good maps were as a treasure right when you took it that was a great prize of maps and they had really good maps of spanish he did all that so you know he chased all these ships and he had a great time and then right he saw another ship that he 'd heard was full of gold right and he was heading off to manila to the west so he failed off that way after that right and he captured that ship too and then he was full of gold and he think oh now it comes where you know profit loss sort of thing like that he was so full of treasure and stuff he thought oh i probably got enough now i think i might just uh shoot on out of here right but you know we 've taken a few hits and all that sort of stuff and the was bit leaky being around for a while like that he left a few years ago you know these time bands up as you go and chip gets a bit of wear and tear and all that sort of stuff so he saw he had sailed north west right northwest and he went up sailed north right and he ended up finding there and he named it new albion and claimed it for the queen put up a block and all that kind of stuff saying hey this is our place now our and what they did then they creamed the ship right now kareem the ship sounds an interesting word and a kareem what it is right is your style it 's like the old beatrice here your sailor in right into that report hello toyed and as the toy goes out right and you try to get a big high tide and you can lay it down on the side so it gets down and it gets then you lay it down on its side all right and then you can clean her off right and all right you can do re-talking and all that sort of stuff fix that river talking is the gaps in between so you fill all the holes and stuff like that and stuff so that 's how we used to fix the ships when we weren 't in a shipyard and all that kind of stuff we just sailed at the port you know did that up north africa and they already had some issues so we just nailed it over lay it up fix it up and you wait for the next big toy and then you sail it back off again you pull it back off you get a little robot bowl it out that kind of stuff and that 's the exciting things you can do when you 're trying to fix the ship and that 's what he did so he carried it all off out over and then he cleaned it all off and got re-talked and all that stuff and he was ready to sail but he didn 't sail background through the spanish he decided he 'd use the bats and stuff he had and he 'd fly oh it 'd go you know west right southwest so we sailed southwest to what they used to call the east indies down indonesia and all that sort of place so he sailed over to there right all right he sailed there and he went up there and he got resupplied and meet some friends there and all that africa and down the side of africa just going in about down in bits and places all the way around then around the cape good hope which is the other bottom bit right so when you see the bottom up there 's two big pointy bottom bits of the big glass vessel and okay so that 's capable here and over here is good hope right that 's good hope that 's okay owens right that 's a great one there that hope twice there go right so he goes around the bottom there and up up up all the way back to plymouth we had all the gold and all that kind of stuff and he was yeah that was a queen and she was so excited and so happy she said i am going to anoint you so she nodded him right on the golden horn the golden oranges pirate ship right the golden orange and he got knighted on the ship right on a pirate ship that is what i call a successful pirate huh in fact if you go to london any day now right if actually see the gold mine in london still sitting there right they 're going to ship there it 's a golden orange you actually check it out right so that 's it you know that 's how popular and successful he was and he got made a sir a sir he thought oh you 've got to be helping then drake he 's going a sir needs a title and one of them a coat of arms you know the coat of arms it has there that shield that says your family name and all that fun stuff like that so we looked at things in beckham devon where are you coming from and he thought ah there 'd be drinks in devon with a coat of arms so he said i 'll just take that one and i 'll just do that i 'm related to them he said ah yeah i 'll be related to them and so he set it up and he announces his court of arms sir francis drake and of course the family from that never went oh who 's this bloke that writes now family right think after a bit of a stink about it right give it a bit of stick and he went oh but again being the queen 's pirate she just stepped in and she made him her own design for him right so we got a coat of arms right so it 's like you know the shield shapes i usually use of him it 's got like a wavy line like sea in the middle right and a star on the top of the star at the bottom right and they were the the north star in the south star like antarctica arctic and antarctic stars and all that so it sort of fit in with him and he had his very own you know coat of arms made by the queen so he was going pretty well you know he got into politics for a while and you know well this is great you know what he 's doing well he 's got a bit of money bought himself a big house right the family live in his big house wherever after that right you know a way because he 'd been away for three years like he 's certainly navigating the group right so he 's the first englishman right that 's what one of the reasons i died to actually go around the globe first time or all the way around and he did it because he was escaping the spanish right he 's a pirate he was just doing priority things just thinking that i 'm not worth going back there i 'll lose all my goal i 'll go this way that 's what we parts do we adapt to get the best profit out of things and that 's what he did and that 's how he come the first englishman to go around the globe pretty exciting stuff right so the spanish and that got a bit uppity up pretty upbeat later on and they started fighting with english again right so she went oh we 'll get them so they 've got drakey right you 've got drakey again because you 've been so successful right gave him a fleet of ships right he said go and give him ports and take ships and stuff like that and passed her around he was so successful one time he found a port full of ships right all right it was full of ships calling down there goodies i think these it was goodies right down there full of ships right full of ships it 's always just attacked they 've gone right in they 've attacked them talked about bringing them second and take themselves out and cannons fire and everywhere and they 'll have this great time and they 've called a little they sunk 39 ships 39 ships which somewhat annoyed somewhat annoyed the old phillip he was so annoyed about this right that he decided he was going to invite england right that 's it he said i 'm going to invade england all right so he did that you know that but these trips were put back a year by this big victory of things we had to put it off another year and all that kind of stuff right and you know drake kept on pestering and giving him hard time one time he took it for all the sailors right and he actually got that one and took off with a hat so that stopped them again they oh problems all that kind of stuff so he did all this sort of stuff right a boy at the time he finally made it right yeah the spanish moderator you call that they called it you know because there 's so many ships right so many ships coming to take over england right they had them all coming up right by the time he got to attack old ricky was the vice admiral of the whole fleet that 's it he got so successful and so into the system right as a poirot that he was a voice admiral right the admiral 's name was lord howard right of evington all right would he be this fellow beer he 'd be one of his descendants right what did the blood really type things right all right remember we talked about captain fred and the old beatrice the old owner of the right so he 'd be related right they all loved everything all right but will drink right em and lord out got together and they come up with this tactic right so as the ships got close they released all these fire ships right they made all these ships i had a really priority trick that actually burned right and they let them into the actual fleet of ships so there 's so many spanish ships coming but they had all these fire ships and that broke them up right that broke up the fleet the armada right so they all started going out into deeper water because they 're trying to get away from the fire because that sea warden ships right with no motors and lots of sails and canvas and wood or all that stuff you don 't want no fires right so they 're scattering all over the place right a lot of the english sticks were smaller too so they could tuck in lily and just attack them that way kind of stuff and so they absolutely demolished them right they absolutely demolished them right and so they destroyed the spanish armada left them in ruins they chased them that kind of stuff and he 'd become a great hero again oh drakey was a great hero because he did that to him right here and everyone and he was good again being a pirate he used his publicity sort of techniques that we use on marketing and all that kind of stuff so we let him know he was waiting for the toy to come before he attacked the course you know so he couldn 't get the ships out of the entire law but what he did he went and played balls and when the legend become right then he was so relaxed about the spanish mother you know it was free to wait to so he was so relaxed then he was playing balls he said i 'll finish my balls first because he couldn 't leave until the toy was up anyway downward anyway right the time was up anyway so he just went you know these are the little ways the little ways you make your reputation right you spread the little germless idea and you let it grow and then you become this navigated the globe first englishman to do that destroy the spanish america great hero but a pirate and he remained part and for ages right you 're just working in the sea you never left the sea right even in his 50s he was still out there cause he started losing his air joints had to lose his edge and uh and you know things didn 't go quite as well he had a few you know over in the americas portuguese he failed doing taking over ship and lost one of his ships and he tackled you towns and that didn 't work out too good for him and so you know he wasn 't so successful later live but you never hear about that right because you know all that success he had when he was young and the old reuter right it would point her at 56 he died of dysentery evolving dysentery that 's right dysentery if you don 't know what dysentery is i 'd say ask your mum or your dad because that 'll give you a chuckle anyway but yeah you know he problems with the bottom bits you know this entry are a sad sad way to go all right and so he wanted to be buried in full honors right so they he got him they got him and they put his armor on he had armor plate shield and that stuff and they put him in a lead-lined coffin maybe that was something to do with the dysentery i 'm not sure right and they sealed it up and they buried him at sea right buried him at seed off portobello it is apparently and they 've had divers and also something looking for his coffin but nobody 's ever found the old francis street car maybe sailed off bit like black beard maybe he 's a ghost traveling the world he needs often who knows but he 'd be a hero and he 'd be the queen 's man queen elizabeth the first let me write privateer she was and she made lots of money out of him right every time he come back with all that treasure 50 50. right he invested a lot himself but she was how the old privateers worked you know same to have a navy if you can have that and then with drake you know you can actually bring him into the fold when you 're actually fighting them proper you know the privateers are when you sort of have one of those wars and you pretend to have a war but you 're not really having a war but when you 're actually fully fighting you go oh no he 's my voice admiral and all the time says oh no that guy he 's just offered i 'm not sure what he 's doing now but you talk to any of them english boys surprise history he 'd be a hero pirate and heroes of francis drake and that be the end of lesson number 23 oh my goodness 23 who would have thought of possible i think i 've talked enough now i think it 's time we just have one laugh one good laugh and i 'll pop you all down so give me a laugh let 's stand free depart let 's get into rock that be seeing you all later of our sammy beauties good point _"

    "text": "hi i 'm vaughn from the sustainable future team at the city of canterbury bankstown on average 40 of what we put into our red bins is food waste which ends up in landfill food waste in landfill generates greenhouse gases which contribute to global climate change so today i 'm cooking up a classic recipe pumpkin soup but with a zero food waste trick i call it pumpkin soup with all the trimmings okay so for this zero food waste recipe i have about two and a half kilos of pumpkin i 've washed the whole pumpkin quite thoroughly um because we 're not chucking away the skin i also have one red onion chopped i have four about five cloves of garlic good for the immunity and because i like my soup spicy i also have some turmeric paprika coriander and cumin seed and i also have a good dash of chili flakes i also have about one and a half liters of veggie stock and some fresh cracked pepper to finish okay so i 'm just going to wrestle with this pumpkin for a bit as i the pulp and the seeds again we 're keeping all this nutritious goodness and flavor to add to our soup later the average new south wales household throws more than three thousand dollars worth of food out each year so by cooking with as much as you can you 're not only helping the environment but you 're also saving money so now that we have our pumpkin skins trimmed we need to separate the pumpkin seeds from the pulp the pulp will go into the soup to add extra flavor and we 're going to do something a little bit later with the pumpkin seeds these are full of protein and goodness and they 're really easy just to separate from the pulp it doesn 't matter if you miss some seeds that end up in the soup because it 's all going to be blended anyway okay so let 's get started on our pumpkin soup with all the trimmings you know have a large pot good glug of olive oil on the bottom [Music] make sure it 's evenly coated we 're going to add our pumpkin as well give that a good mix until it starts to caramelize and onions become just a little bit translucent okay so the onion has started to go lovely and translucent and the pumpkin is starting to caramelise so we 're going to add our pumpkin pulp zero food waste garlic our lovely spices [Applause] two dash of chili like it spicy and a good pinch of cracked black pepper a good sprinkling of salt give that a good stir and once it 's all coated add your veggie stock make sure to add enough liquid to just cover the pumpkin flesh pop the lid on and let it boil away so as our pumpkin soup is bubbling away with all those lovely spices let 's get on to our zero food waste trick with our pumpkin skins and our nutritious pumpkin seeds i 'm going to do a quick marinade before i roast these in the oven at 180 degrees today i 'm going to use a good glove of olive oil some delicious sweet honey you can make it as sweet as you like i 'm going to pumpkin skins and the seeds and like i said earlier i like a bit of spice so i 'm going to go with a bit of sumac and also some chili flakes give that a quick stir and you have this lovely rich dark marinade you 're just going to coat your pumpkin skins in the marinade okay don 't forget to reserve some of that delicious marinade for your pumpkin seeds the sumac will add a lovely zingy flavor and the chili will give it that beautiful spicy kick okay so now that our pumpkin skins and seeds are evenly coated in our sumac and chili honey marinade we 're just going to pop them on a lined baking tray with the pumpkin seeds put them on a separate baking tray to your skins because they will need only about 20 minutes at a 180 degree oven where your skins might take a little bit longer now different pumpkins different varieties they all differ in the amount of seeds they have so as you can see we didn 't get many seeds from this pumpkin but that 's okay delicious spread it out nice and flat and some cracked black pepper and just a touch of salt as well okay so let 's pop the pumpkin skins and seeds in the oven at 180 degrees your skins will need about 30 minutes but your pumpkin seeds on a separate tray will only need no more than 20 minutes so keep an eye on them because we better not let them burn it 's been about 30 minutes let 's check in our pumpkin oh that smells absolutely delicious the pumpkin is beautifully soft so just before we blend this soup up with a stick blender i 'm going to add fresh ginger i love ginger it can be expensive so i actually store my ginger in the freezer this helps to prolong its shelf life and it makes it so easy to grate it into soups and also stir fries so i 'm gonna add quite a bit like i said i love ginger but you can just add however much you want it 's enough ginger and we 're just going to take care again [Music] and just our beautiful pumpkin soup and now it 's time to add trimmings so we 've got our lovely pumpkin skins they 've roasted up quite nicely they 'll add a lovely texture and color to the pumpkin soup and of course our crunchy pumpkin seeds with sumac honey and chili finish off with a sprinkling of chili extra spice and a sprig of fresh parsley that i 've just cut from the garden so today we made pumpkin soup with a lot the skin the seeds the pulp and the flesh the only thing left 12 grams of the woody stem from the two and a half kilo pumpkin that we started with but this is not going in my red bin i 'm going to feed it to my worms thanks for watching we 'd love to learn your food waste reduction recipes in the comments below you _"

    "text": "first there ha ha are you being mates we 'll be back we 'll be back for lesson number 2121 today let 's give you the key to the door i hired that expression so you used to do this to give us the key to the door you turned 21 yet the key to the door of course peter pirate i don 't really need a door we just gotta bust that way through he 's a cannon smash that 's what it 's all about 21 who would have believed it give me an r r give me another r r put them all together and they do indeed spell be right we 're here again 21 lessons who 'd have thought it possibly how long can you go on can they go how long can you go on and always say well pardon 's been around hundreds of hundreds of years so you may well be stuck with me for the duration of this year ben of course there may be a mutiny or something like that to get rid of me but until then i 'm on i think it 's time we stood and laughed my pirates feet apart hands on your hips you then rock in the ocean that 's it you turn and look up and laugh because you 're not scared or nothing you 're a pirate a little swashbuckling pirate that 'd be true right what are we coming today oh from last week i was talking all about you know by the board right let things go by the board remember that i was telling you that everything that gets thrown over the side goes by the board because the board is this top bit of the ship there right the board right and i don 't think i actually mentioned that obviously overboard we talk about going overboard means when you go over that stuff everything you throw over that bit of the ship is overboard right and that 's where that comes from natural progression right i don 't think i actually mentioned that so i just thought i should mention that right and while we were on that part of the old beatrice see that room across okay the gunnels all right and so that 's where the expression fall of the gunnels comes from when you say your ship 's full of the gun holes you know it 's right full right up to the top right that 's when you you know that 's the expression comes from i 'm full of the gunnels right that 's where it is because that 's the goals of that bit that runs right across the top there so if you follow the gunnels it 's all full right now and that 's where it comes from of course if i was for the gunnels it might be wise for you to give me a wide birth you know when you say oh i 'll give that person a white birthday don 't go too near him well why birth again ameritoy expression right this ship here is burst okay beatrice here is burst right now you can see there it goes it 's headed out there birth there right there and that 's basically your birth is where the ship ties up you know they 're both harbor right out of the port against the wood bit they 're loading in and out otherwise you 'll see ships that are birthed that are just tied off there on the little boys and stuff like that okay so that 's with the birthday that 's what we call a birth and why would you have a wide berth you say well wide birth means a girl to keep away from things and that means the same thing in the sea right you have a wide berth basically ships have been anchored like this in port you give them a wide berth you wouldn 't know what i 'm too close together right because as the wind changes and the tide changes the ships move around you 'll see that they move around into the wind so the pointy bits pointing the end wind like that or with the toy and all that kind of stuff so if two ships together go around and they 're too close they 'll back into each other so you give them a wide birth right or the needle so if there 's those rocks and things are dangerous so that 's why where why birth came from right all sort of makes sense you know we don 't try to trick you we say this we keep things you know pretty simple like another expression you heard sling your hook you 're right it 's like your hook which pretty much you said get out of here right sling your hook you know get out of here that kind of thing well a hook another name for an anchor because shaped like a big oak and a big anchor like that right so sling your hook when you hoisted up your ankle right you 'd have to tie it off so it didn 't fall back down or holding somebody 's foot or something when the seats got rough so it was slinged up right so sling your hook means pull your anchor up and get out of there right so sling your hook get out of here right that 's the way it works right another expression we look about right is plumb the depths you know oh you 've been right well plumbing the decks right this thing called hydrography right hydrography right that 's what we used to use right because they had like a plum line like the old plum noise you got now right it 's a little ball above it a little measuring bit with a measured out the different lengths i don 't like different phantoms of length all right no phantoms are six feet right so that be set down the bottom and you 'll be able to tell how deep it was so if you knew how deep your ship was and you knew how deep the bottom was you wouldn 't run into it right so that was the idea so you 'd be plumbing the depths to see where you could fit and how far into our harbor you could go and so when you come to a new port right a new harbor or bay or something like that you 'd send it in the hydrograph all right and you imagine plumbing the depths to see how deep it was so you know how far you go in before your a wide berth so they all sort of fit together right now hydrographers why we 're here right the original owner of the old beaches right was a hydrograph he was and i 've even got his picture you see pictures see that see the filler up there right he 's name was frederick always right all right he 's a graphic right i needed all sorts of mapping up around darwin and stuff like that so you go up there and you go to allen springs place named after him right there you go little wax like that but he was a hydrographer right now that was his job and this was his ship before i sort of acquired it you know as we do being a pirate you uh acquire other people 's ships because that 's a heavy thing to do right this is all right cold and blue season always good to have a pirate inky all right no worries so where are you right ah no a couple of facts a couple of questions people had about somebody said i 've heard of these red said well they were in fact right scottish pirates right they call them red legs now why would you call a scottish pirate red legs why because the blighters well kilts you know those kilt cells dress them in way right little check ones and all that kind of stuff are killed straight the other squats used to wear and so because their legs were out in the sun right and the weather and the rain all that when they 're at sea they were red the whole time so they became known as red legs right that 's how you tell the scottish sailor boys red legs a lot about red hair as well but their legs were red right because they 're wearing those kilts right we 've got their kilts and all sorts of problems but no that 's what they did right and the other one i was going to cover right people asked about right was the black spot what 's this about the black spot i heard about the black spot here tales of the black spot well that was one of our tricks you know what 's telling you about the flags we 're all about intimidating people and our legends and all that fun you build up your things so people would just surrender so the black spot would be like an advanced way to scare people you 'd send them an envelope right with a letter in it they 'd just be a black spot and then we 'd know that the parties were coming to get them right so they 'd be boring on the edge right so more likely surrender and all that sort of stuff because they 'd be scared out of themselves right they 're scared willingless right so that 'd be it you know so that 's something you should know about the black spot right now the other thing i said before right about the swashbuckling pirates you heard that kind of special pirate swashbuckling but what does swashbuckling mean you say what does flashback mean does that mean we just go all together now the original expression right if you look in the dictionary right you know that book with the words and stuff in your computer or they might even call it still called a dictionary right you just type in the word it says up there swashbuckler well swashbuckles right tell you what it says they know like fighting men who had bluster and swagger right buster that 's like the wind blusters right it 's when the wind is really strong and windy where are blasters right so that sort of reverted the way they were talking busters and wind and all that stuff and swagger is about the way you walk when you walk with a swagger it 's like you 're strutting it 's like when you 're standing there going ha ha that 's with sweater right that 's what that 's all about so that 's where a swashbuckling comes from that word and the original derivation right swash right it 's an old english word swash right it actually means like the sound of the soil goes washed and sort of like water sound like washed down so swash that 's where that comes from and a buckler right that was those shields they used to over the swords and that the little rounds shield well that shield 's called a buckler right so swashbucklers the original swashbucklers right they 'd use it to intimidate the enemy right they 'd be banging the shields and they 'll go whoa they deal all sorts of things they bagged the shield and all that kind of stuff you know remember we 've taken out the void kings before right the vikings one of their old war cries would be ahoy so we got oi so you know part two oh yeah we do that as well so who knows but all right so that 's what it was so swashbuckled was all about making a lot of noise and intimidating people which is pretty much as pirate again we 're talking about with the black spot and the pirate flags that we did to intimidate people so that 's part of the swagger and having all that sort of stuff and strutting about it was all part of the game plan to make people sort of surrender without a fight to make things easier you know which financially it 's all about it 's all about economics really poor and economics are that 's why the bankers and insurance companies are full of pirates these days that 's right because that 's where they all went to that 's right anyway now we have the expression we told the other day about one of the pirates here and it only was our idea of what he said about a party life was a very life but a short one right now that 'd be true but i thought i would tell you the tale the tale of a faithful ship or what tail was a fishy bison bowl i should call the fancy actually the fancy was asleep all right but i 'll tell you something about a pirate okay just a title they give you an idea of the other side of things those things are a bit better right so one day april fool 's day that was april fool 's day right in the caribbean 1996 1696 it was right and this throughput i was just telling you about call the fancy right the sloop than that right than the old bhs right yeah it had a big mainsail which that 's that 's my main say all right big male 2 and then the front seals right there so was gonna be like that 's luke so we 're bit smaller than the old beaches right all right that was the name of the ship right this loop all right and pulled into the nassau county which is capital of barbados capital of the bahamas sorry about i 'm sorry i 'm gonna talk about baby this a bit later right bahamas right and it 's an island in the caribbean right in the caribbean up there great that night so a small group of sailors rode in and their jolly boat roll roll roll roll over to the shore right and they make a beeline straight to the governor 's place right the british governor in there of all of bobby this was there right his name was nicholas trott right nicholas trot right so so they come out to mr trot right the governor and the sailor was doing all the speaking that outside the harbor was a fabulous warship the fantasy exaggerating a little bit right with over hundreds old sailors on there you know all they 're just sitting outside and he told the governor he said oh we 've been off you know doing the slaving market noodle isn 't making all this money right and that kind of stuff and we 're all down on supplies and we didn 't need a shore leave and the captain here he gave me this letter to gift here and in the letter it says harry his name was captain bridgeman right and he said all right i 've been doing all this you know and i 'd like to you know disembark in the airport bring all the crew a bit of a break all right kind of stuff like that and you know with no questions asked to be best and all that kind of stuff and you know i 'm happy to pay you for it and he said i will give you right 860 british pounds right and i will give you the fancy my big ship pretty interesting right because you know the average governor would make about 300 pounds a year right so that 's you know getting up to about three years salary for him ryan bossy gets the ship he thought that sounds interesting so what do i do i don 't know what to say he so well you think maybe maybe maybe right i should organize to uh have a chat to the you know the town council right so we got with the town council all right we talked to town council okay and they had a meeting right but he thought i don 't think i 'll mention about the you know the 860 pounds worth of gold and diamonds and stuff he was going to give me right or the ship i might try another tact he goes oh he took another attack right so he went to him and he said to the council well this big ship here if it comes into the port right any past and friendship that might think oh we 'll go and attack there and get a bit of booty and they do attack all these wonderful sailors right hard and battle heart and sideways they 'll be here to protect us all right they 'll be good to protect us you know we 'll make them our alloys and all that sort of stuff and so the council thought oh that sounds like a good idea we need a bit of protection there 's some big friendships around there they 've heard stories and you know and all the henry there he told him a few stories and oh yeah we passed a friendship out there we big one lots of guns well but we 'd be bigger don 't know that 's us so you know eventually the council agreed all right so he agreed and sure enough pirates came into the board right and they came off carrying pockets and buckets you know treasure chests full of gold and doughnuts and roomies and all sorts of things like that right and they go over the truck right they give him the piece pile of 860 things he 's saying oh that 's good and they give him the that 's all yours right and they went off to the pub and he went all right then so it was a bit smaller they thought we don 't know it 's all right when he got on there right he realized he had a bonus he looked around and there was like barrels barrels of gunpowder and piles of muskets and a whole pile of anchors and a big stock of elephant hot tusks right which worth lot of money in those days these days we no it 's not good to counter them downs wouldn 't get 100 but those days you know ivory was used for all sorts of things right pianos even right so he thought oh that 's probably done pretty well here right then bit further inspection you notice that you know there were lots of little uh musket holes all over the place and some cannonball damage and all sorts of things like that and he realized all a sudden that i don 't think these boys have been carrying out some legal trade i don 't think they 've been slaving or that they were pirates oh no so what she do he thinks oh dear me their boyfriend should i have authorities what should they and then he thought but i do have all this money i haven 't told anybody and this ship what should i do well he took the choice that many a politician would have taken right what did he do he took the choice he said hmm i might just keep it to myself who 's gonna know he said who 's gonna know and so those parts all right just drifted away all right he didn 't realize that one of those the real captain right richmond was actually a figment of their imagination just something they mentioned they 'd heard about the dog right they had a bit of rip around the area but ah it was really henry avery a very successful pirate you could tell by all the stuff there right fairies in fact there were british trips all over the globe right all over the globe hunting him down like over in bombay in india madagascar on the east coast of everywhere for him and there he was sitting in nassau in a pub having a hill all right just sitting back enjoying himself right and then after they 'd finished their drink and all that stuff they disappeared in the sunset all his crew just disappeared with their shares all right and not to be seen right about six of them got caught at a later dates and different reasons they got caught by that and obviously blew their money gotta let themselves away right and they got all shipped back to england for punishment right but not all avery right so we retired a successful part right never heard of again he just slipped into the distance and he probably got shipped somewhere else and all that kind of stuff and there he was so he would have lived a ripe old age the old henry avery great pirate clever man and you know using the system for his own good so that 's a good story you know get us back in let 's give just give me an r right maybe another r r r that 'd it please spell good job right now i 've been talking about the you know the caribbean right now i don 't know why i thought that caribbean i thought she 'd clear something up you know like a you know did you know sort of thing right because all these islands in the caribbean are all together they 're loosely linked up that kind of stuff but they 're actually different countries okay all different countries people talk about caribbean and west indies i think it 's all one place but they 're all these little countries right so you know so you know they have different sort of economies some are going well don 't do well so you know it 's like if i bought an apple pie in jamaica and it cost me about 3.50 right but you know if i wouldn 't got that same buy that same pie in the bahamas right wherever he was there that 'd cost me four bucks all right four dollars yeah so much difference like that kind of stuff and if i went to barbados right if i for two bucks two bucks it 's true and that it is true that is in fact the pie rates of the caribbean that 'd be right then that might not sound too interesting to you but that disney blog right he managed to get a big ride and six movies out of the boy race of the caribbean i mean who knows who knew i don 't know what the ride was like there 's pies flying everywhere who knows but there you go that 's what we have another thing to happen you know lesson 21 you 've learned all these sort of hacks all right now i don 't know why i think that might be the end of it right i don 't know if there 's anything else i 've got to cover we 've talked with that swatch box that 's about it but there you go we 've done another list we just sort of taking them off you know taking them off you know people saying well this ever end but like i said there 's a over hundreds and hundreds and go through i may be here forever who knows if they keep locking this down maybe this is the way to stop the lockdown they 'll say please stop the lockdown many of you and the politicians said you can 't_''_1156.4 knock us down anymore you 've got to stop that follow that fella that just keeps on going oh no i don 't know i don 't know about the pirates who knew who knew somebody could talk for so long about so little for so many ways all right who knew we all knew wouldn 't we because we 're all pirates together give me a laugh that 'd be right come on my friends we 're off for no booty so let 's be going now come on give me a big [Music] [Laughter] i 'll be seeing you next week it may be for many weeks to come who knows but we 're all in this adventure together see you guys [Laughter] again going to be point down [Music] haha _"

    "text": "we 'll be back for lesson number 24 two four two for what i don 't know but two for me and some for you maybe who knows once we do the plunder we 'll share it all out actually that be it wouldn 't it if i 'm the captain it 'd be true for me and just one for you that 'd be the way it is in the articles you signed them you 're stuck with them unless of course you vote me out i remember we pirates are a democracy so we don 't we must be nice to you once you 're all part of the crew right anyway we 're back we 're back for lesson number 24 24 unbelievable right so next we 're gonna talk about a few things score a few more things and you know rehash a few things just to keep you on the page make sure you 're keeping up with stuff right so first of course give me an r give me another r r put them all together and i indeed do spell r [Music] we okay so well let 's stand like a pirate ready your hands on your hips your feet are shoulder width apart and you 're rocking because we 're on the sea remember on the sea the ways feet close together you fall over we 're looking now we turn to the side and we 'd lift our head stretch our double chins and go give me that pirate laugh that 'd be right all right remember our port and start it right now ports your left that 's the side you load on starboard was the old steering side all right the starboard side a little harder for the port all right not too confusing all right remember the arft of the ship and the stern that 's the earth there and the battleship with the front all right now we 're looking at the bits of the ship here remember this pointy bit here right that was the bell sprite you remember that right yeah yep and the booms right the booms right because this is a four to aft rig right so the sails go backwards instead of big square riggers you 'll see those big ones right captain cook and all that you know endeavor they were square riggers right they all bark endeavour all right that 's the square eggs but this one being a topsail schooner remember because it 's got those ones at the top right schooners of this shape so they 're four to arf so the sails go that way right and then on the bottom of these that be the boom right right that is a boom because it 's a scooter like that these ones here that go sideways they call gas right so these sails up here are gaff green you 'd see because they 're on two gas right and that kind of stuff right all right but these ones here like you know which are on the square ones right theme they 're the yards right and you can see the little bit there it 's got a little little dip i don 't if you see it on your thing now that 's when they say the yard arms oyster they are on there yard on on there it 's called the yard on actually because they 're the end bits on the ark again we don 't try to trick you we keep it all pretty simple right i remember rigging right rigging we called all the ropes and things that we used to handle the sails and everything we do and everything that you know how you pull them tight now you 're tightening up when you tie them off and all the ropes and all that things everything all that kind of stuff it 's called the rigging right the ring now a big part of the rigging some new stuff now right is blocking tackles right block and tackles right that 's what we call it right these are blocking tackles right you 've never heard of blocking tackles this is what it is right they 're big pulleys with ropes okay you know if you ever wondered you know these things these sails are heavy here anchors they 're heavy how do you lift all this stuff captain how do you lift it without hundreds of copper hands on the ship many hands and too much to share the treasure also there 's not enough room for all of them right so you need things to assist you give you what they call a mechanical advantage right and now you guys have what you press button blockers now you know you do press your button and it does everything for you but we had to think and make things work for us right and a great way to make things work for you is these things blocking tackles bucket tackles vacancy pulleys right and ropes and in a block all right so pulleys working together that 's called a block when you 've got a few pulleys working together that be a block so by spacing a pulley is a wheel that the rope goes through right so if we just have one wheel over right that just one wheel over and you 've got a weight on that side basically to pull down to make it lift up you got to use the same amount of weight right so i get if i got a 50 kg thing there right with 50 kgs of force if i just got one wheel right but i add a wheel right so there 's one at the bottom it goes up the top like that right that see i 've got little diagrams here explaining once i do that see that 's how it works so that basically same amount of force right on that if i pull it up that 's all but i have one pulley where the rope goes up and down right i only have to use half of as much of the power right if i get the four wheels in there well three wheels will give me a third of the power i need and if four it becomes a quarter right so every time i add another wheel going around right it makes it lighter for me right so i don 't have to use so much energy so lifting these big heavy ones and so all the different pulleys right have different things you know something called the lift pulleys blocks and all that sort of stuff and that 's because they control the loft seals i 'm not going to point them out here but there 's no enough sails on that because it 's not that big a boat right but that 's how it all works right so the pulleys now we get a lot of the work done all right it 's all a collection of wheels so that 's the important thing when working out how it all works okay so you 're not thinking oh my goodness i don 't think i could enjoy no captain 's crew it 's too much hard work but you know we 're smart we work our way around all that work right so that 's be it all right that 'd be the way that work and that 'd be the way to look right on the ship so the bigger that and right oh that was all i was gonna say right so jump into an expression here we talk about expressions you heard the expression chalk a block right chalk a block that means things that fall you know you fill that up chuckle block it 's right full but the ropes so much right that the two pulleys and blocks right our pulleys there come together and they jam together that 's chock-a-block right and you 've got no more rope there can 't go no further it 's full up basically chock-a-block that 's what truffle block actually meant right when the two pulleys come together it was chuck a block and that 's what it is now today expression that thing 's chock-a-block that 's how it works right okay means completely full next up right oh we 're gonna talk ballast again right ballast remember i took ballast last time right ballast is the heavy stuff that makes you sail right on the plinths of the line right the plimpser line is the low end right that 's the perfect place between the waterline and the keel or at the top the boulder where the water should be traveling when you 're sailing at the best point and the keel right to give you the drought draft that you need underneath strength the draft is how far off the bottom you are right that 's how knows how deep you are when you look at your charts and all that kind of stuff that 's the draft right so the prince alone is where they mark along that 's the ideal spot right so it 's to that down there right and above to the board right it 's a minimum height free board they call it which is remember the side is the board right so free board is that from that 's free from the water so it 's basically from the water line up right to the top of the board there right that 's why they call it the free board so that 'll be there there so free more up to there right so that be the minimum size the guy named samuel blimpson developed that right what do i have calculations and all that kind of stuff basically it 's the safest distance where water is going to come in right you want to keep it with the waves and all that kind of stuff so you don 't sink so it works it all out right and that 's isn 't important today right i mean you see those big tankers i talked about them before the big tankers right you know you 've got their lines painted on right they say the prince will always play it on and they need the ballast because the wind and stuff can push you around if you 're in the wrong spot if you 're not fully set up properly right even the modern ship with your big engines and stuff like that you can get in trouble you remember a few years back a lot of years back for some of you if you 're just 10 it 's more than you 've got right about 2007 or whatever a huge big storm right and you get you can look this up right a big storm up all up the coast right that newcastle one of them big tankers right it washed ashore big big big tanker big huge thing stuck on the beach out of that happen you see out of one of these big modern boats heaven it was ballast ballast was the reason right what happened is supposed to do right all the ships were supposed to go too miley up the sea right so they were far enough away they wouldn 't get blown in plus they 're supposed to fill the ballast tanks right so they will sink lower in the water right when see this one 's out of the water right because it hasn 't waiting to get loaded up right so when it 's loaded up the water will rise up to about here right okay and that 'll be it 's the best sailing distance right but when you 're out of the water we ain 't got no ballast and no load you 've got all that big space imagine on a tanker that 's a huge big height right so that just acted as a sail so that guy didn 't go out as far as he was supposed to he got hit by the big southerlies right which are really strung up on down the coast up here right the southerlies are the big strong winds you 'll feel when you 're at the beach like the sand they be the sullies right and so what happened was right it was in too close he started getting blown in towards the rocks anyway oh hey that 's not good but hey i 'm a ship i 'm right i 'm a big ship big engine ha weather don 't bother me so he starts praying about that but as he 's trying to go out the whole side of his ship acts like a big sail even though he 's got a motor he 's got this big wide expanse of steel right no giving it right no give like a sail you can 't pull it off or lower it down all kind of stuff it 's just this big thing and the wind was pushing pushing pushing him right and he is coming along and he 's thinking i 'm getting a bit close to those rocks and he 's trying to skip around and he just got around the rocks right right just got a rocks and then he 's getting close to the beach but he 's thinking i 'm gonna make it i boat right caught on a reef right and once it was stuck what happens you gotta want to put a point there then the sail just caught and just pushed him around same thing will happen if you 're actually sailing and you misjudge the wind you 'll pull you off then you it 'll change your direction completely and you 'll lose control over there right that 's what happened hit him and then he swung around and then he was heading straight towards the beach right then they got hit by another surge and a weight surge popped up and he was stuck right that was all because he didn 't fill these valles tanks remember modern ships they use water to fill them we always we used to use bigger lumps of stuff right we 'd have to load big ones and stuff right he had no excuse just gotta pump the water on takes a bit of time but not as much as carrying large every lumps of stuff right and so that 's where ballast is really important when you 're saving right it keeps control over your ship right and you don 't sink which is always an advantage and you don 't get blown up and stuck on the ground you have more control so that 's the importance of ballast right and that 's what he didn 't do and last week right last week right we talked about you know privateers the queen 's privateer remember francis street we talked about him last week right well what he had right from the queen was what we call a letter of mark right and i grabbed you one okay i even got one that 's up the right way there it is all right so this is the letter remarks this is what you have all right and that is your license to pirate basically right back there you licensed the pirate so it tells you what you can do it says right you can tax the spanish right you can capture their ship and offer it for ransom or you can bring it back to port share the treasure with me and then also you know with the deeds to you all that stuff you legally take the ship you have all the things they have stated what share you give the queen and all that sort of stuff and that 's what you would show right and that way if the you know if you 're doing it for the english or eat and then you come into an english port they said hey that doesn 't look like you haven 't got the right paperwork with that ship you go ah but i do have a letter or marker and that 's how it all worked so that was the official so these pirates oh they call privateers right of course errors when they 're being fancy frenchies that 's what you used to do right you have a full-on contract signed and sealed and that 'd be your letter of mark right and that 's what it 'd be called now i 'm going to talk about a few more uh these definitions and stuff like that all right things terms modern terms and all that kind of stuff so loggerhead is the other one log ahead was 're at lava heads you know that means we can 't agree we 're you know we 're in an impasse they say these days you know we 're loggerheads we can 't do it well the loggerhead right was in a whaling boat all right unavailable they 've got a board up here right okay at the back where they toy off the rope when they when they spear them right this the big harpooner go out and hit a whale and had a big rope a toy to it right like that and then they 'd let it fly right out and they tie it to the area at the yeah a lump of wood at the stern right they called the loggerhead right basically the whale would pull it to the end of its rope and then it would just pull the ship around so they wouldn 't agree aren 't they both pulling against each other neither going in the same direction right and that was a loggerhead right they were at loggerheads that 's where that comes from the longer it was in a wheeling because basically between the boat and the empire and the whale they weren 't going to agree on that what was going to happen because next wasn 't really good for the way all right so that was it so until that was resolved until the whale pulled the ship and down under the water or did something or got away or till the whale ran out of steam there were logger heads and and that sort of tied up so that way that word come from loggerhead right so where do you hail from as another one right where do you hail from yeah where do you hail from well that was all you say the ships right two ships with person an edl where do you hail from because you want to know what port they came from right because that was part of the navigation remember it was you know dead record and we 're talking about with navigation okay so where do you hail from if i know he 's hailed from you know uh newcastle 's overpowered fail for newcastle i know i 'm not right there or i know where it 's going on we can exchange that kind of information so it was the first bit of exchanging of information like under navigation purposes as you 're going past right and you know ship like past like chips in the night so we talked about passing right past like ships to the night that makes sense because two ships that go past each other at night only briefly see each other right you know starlight they might see a bit longer but basically there 's not a lot of light on these old ships so we didn 't see him for very long so when two people parse like ships in the night very romantic sounding and all that just means they don 't know each other for very long you know we 've parsed like ships in the night we just saw each other but then we 're gone and that 's what it 's like you know two ships and then they 're gone because you don 't see it much in the dark so that 's why it ships in have all those cannons there 's another one i was gonna talk about something you know he 's a loose can 't_''_899.44 let go he 's got a loose cannon right sort of means he 's unpredictable a bit crazy but mad well that makes sense too i mean nothing 's more crazy or unpredictable than having a loose cannon on the ship right you know you haven 't_''_911.12 toyed down your cannon and it starts rolling across the decking knock out crew i can slide on the other side break the side of the ship even bust it open and stuff like that you knock the mast down cause all kinds of problems right so having a loose cannon is a crazy thing to do and that 's why it 's called that right blue cannon all right and now what else is there i think i know that okay now last one i was going to do with these kind of things like that you know this expression about rubbing salt into the wound you 're making things worse he 's just rubbing salt into the wound again we talked about you know getting the cat out of the bag and all that kind of stuff when you get whipped and you get you know cuts and stuff on you if they rub salt or vinegar into your wound it makes it sting like all hell so it 's more of a punishment right so if your parents you know start rubbing salt and vinegar and they you 've really annoyed them okay just remember that and maybe try to be a little bit better for them all right you know so that 's you know something you should think about right but that 's what it was called rubbing salt in the wound was just that extra little bit of punishment now i was just going to finish with one last tale about ropes all right one little more root tail i wanted to finish with because you know i 'm here and i might as well tell your tale all right so just give me an r good all right so this rope walked into a bar right okay it 's a jokey tail so rope 't see you sorry sir served your type in here you know that we don 't save your type in here rope get out of here so the rope turns out right and he gets at the other end and he ties himself into a big knot and then he frees the end gets a little bit of rope put out everywhere like that kind of stuff you know sort of like a hairdo right then he wanders back in all disguised and all that like too well sir he says right and the bar said are you just that wrote was in here a while ago and he said no afraid not all right i can tell you 're all laughing hysterically at the back there maybe you might better just force them laugh by going stand a little like a pirate oh isn 't that a great way we can get your own jokes laughed at just by manipulation i should go into politics if i can get people to do things like that hey right that be it lesson 24 over wrapped everything sealed toyed off we 'll just go downstairs and have a nap because i 'm gonna you know wipe us down all right thank you very much for joining me for lesson number 24 24. my goodness [Music] other stairs see you next ha ha ha ha ha ha _"

    "text": "hello everyone uh thank you so much for joining me my name is paul f hoeven the f stands for francis please don 't hold that against me uh i 'm an author uh a broadcaster entertainer and i 've actually written a book uh it 's called electric blue and it 's right behind me it 's the pink and blue one now um thank you so much for coming along obviously at this particular time we can 't_''_21.6 be in libraries physically uh during the tour of my first book loose units i really enjoyed hopping from bookstore bookstore and library library often with my dad in tow and it was a really enjoyable journey so i 'm really sorry that we couldn 't be together in person but now this will be immortalized forever i believe that this video will outlast any kind of nuclear apocalypse that we lived through so if you 're watching this from a full house shelter hello and uh this used to be a called a hawaiian shirt um where to begin so about when i was about seven years old uh was a cop in the 80s in sydney he lived through some incredibly insane awful stressful horrifying stuff and obviously i grew up with a bit of a complex i wanted to you know kind of be as heroic as him a couple of years ago i sat him down and basically got him to talk me through uh what he lived through as a police officer in the roaring terrifying corrupt 1980s he was stationed over at north sydney in fact and i wrote a book about it i wrote a book called loose units and it 's effectively the princess bride with guns and car tracers so it 's me and dad in the present day going through his case files and then snapping back to the 1980s when a 21 year old john verhoeven my dad was on patrol and was trying to be the best person he could be was trying to be heroic and was going through some pretty weird stuff so that 's loose units and loose units was really enjoyable it went really well and what happened after that was dad and i four loose units uh kind of couldn 't stop dad 's sort of i basically i 'd let the genie out of the bottle uh with dad and his stories of his time on the force he was telling me stories of you know a woman who was shown in half under a train carriage and he had to hold her in two pieces while she passed away he encountered a witch he stopped jewelry heists there were car chases there was intrigue and there was a love story because dad met my mum on the force and uh after two weeks which if you 're watching dad uh it 's probably a little bit fast for that sort of thing uh they got together and they got engaged and they had me again very very quick so loose units became this really wonderful adventure but we weren 't done yet so we started getting together every week and kind of just trying to recapture the magic and we realized that dad had all these cases that didn 't make it into the first book and so we started doing two and a half three years and we 've had like over two million listings we have listeners all over the world we 've done live shows all over australia and like i said we 've done appearances at libraries and bookstores and obviously that 's something that we can 't be doing right now which is a real bummer but we do have this so it 's really nice to have you all here now the reason i set up what loose units is is because my new book electric blue is actually a sequel to loose units now after dad finished his time on patrol you know just being a uniform police officer and one of the things about dad is he 's very proactive and uh like me i 've been diagnosed with adhd in case you couldn 't already tell and one of dad 's things was he just was always pursuing work he was very restless and he and his partner julian at the time would effectively go out and try and you know just just look actively pursue work because police is a reactive go and clean up but dad and julian thought what if we actually try and solve crime and solve problems the thing is that 's not the job of a patrol officer technically that 's the job of detectives dad really wanted to be a detective now at the end of loose units and i highly recommend if you haven 't read lewis units to pester the library that you 're watching this from and just make sure they have copies and uh uh you know read loose units first but at the end of loose units uh dad finds out that actually he kind of doesn 't want to be a detective he wants to be in forensics now for anyone who 's watched csi something like that in real life obviously there 's a far less hair product and peroxide and you know crash zooms on uh on objects but one thing that dad learned was that forensics was a lot more interesting than he thought and electric blue is set in the mid-80s and it 's about my dad the former patrol officer throwing himself into the know autopsies and crime scene analysis and it 's all set in the 80s now one of the things that i found really interesting about writing electric blue was that suddenly after having done years of work with dad and having written the first book i wanted to do something a lot bigger and a lot more ambitious and a lot weirder because one of the things that i discovered was that people really resonated with the story of dad and i as a father and son coming to understand each other better now i never completely understood why dad wanted to talk me out of being a cop and i always assumed it was due to some you know deep-seated character flaw or something i always thought it was because i wasn 't good enough obviously they say dress for the job you want and as you can see from my shirt i wanted to be a detective in hawaii in the 80s um i i just grew up worshiping you know detective work and crime solving and i never thought i have what it took and apparently neither of god 's time in forensics but it 's also kind of a really deep dive into what it 's like to be a son who has a dad who is a hero cop who fights crime gets into car chases and is basically a modern day 80s style sherlock holmes i am a really big fan of a whole bunch of different genres and like i said i have adhd so it 's part true crime it 's definitely part true crime because it 's based on completely true events and cases that did actually happen so when you read electric blue you 'll actually be finding out about you know some really scary stuff that went down in the 80s and crimes that you probably never even heard of that were taking place right under people 's noses all across the northern beaches north sydney and in the city but you will also find out about my journey with dad and it 's you know it 's part road movie it 's part adventure story there 's some weird fiction stuff in there i illustrated part of the on true events and it 's been a real whirlwind to actually write and get this thing done and i 'm really excited about the prospect of all of you reading it um my influences obviously growing up were you know as you can see from my bookshelf there 's a lot of really weird stuff here i was really influenced by the book of stephen king which obviously is completely fictional um but i really like you know crunchy meaty violent weird funny writing and i hope i 've managed to capture some of that for you now um one thing i would like to do for you now if you 're amenable and if you 're you know enjoying yourselves in this very virtual environment is i would like to read a chapter for you from the book and i hope you don 't mind i was going to read the first chapter because you know it 's a very good place to start so oh look there 's a copy right there here we go so electric blue chapter one also i thought you might like to were very tolerant let me dip it in yeah that 's just giving you any idea of what kind of a book this is here we go oh wow chapter one cop to it there 's blood everywhere a murder has been carried out and only i can solve it this i think is shaping up to be a really good book i 'm 11. i 'm in a cavernous bookstore at waringamore with my dad john he 's an ex-cop and he 's over by the thriller section but before he wandered off to busy himself he guided me to a shelf this shelf right here then he reached up and handed me a book the book is called who killed harlow thrombi and much like me it weighs almost nothing i 'm tall and lean and very bored and i 'm sad i 'm very sad and i don 't know why maybe dad knows maybe that 's why i bought me shopping the book isn 't a normal book not like the one you 're holding huge delirious letters proclaimed that it 's a choose your own mishmash of tropes the sinister gardener lurking in the corner the big chin hero detective floating up near the title and like a movie poster it 's like a movie poster i think to myself turning it over in my head a movie poster on a book what a world dad is eyeing me from across the store he 's wearing an expression one one wears when hoping not to startle a deer i open the book that heady new book smell reaching my nose almost instantly another one and i 'm worried that after years of completely bouncing off the written word this book will offer me nothing i have adhd you see my brain just sort of wanders off after a few pages whenever i try to read i enjoy the first few pages the promise the book holds but then i fear that the adhd will take control again adhd attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ever tried to wrestle with adhd imagine your brain your focus your drive your attention as a plume of smoke got it thick clean sweet smoke swirling churlishly around your head now imagine should probably wave back there we go now you 're both waving and what 's that he 's holding a big glass bottle he 's handing it to you he 's right he 's seen something shiny and run off after it just you and the bottle now kid now do me a favor would you try to get the smoke back into the bottle no i 'm serious that 's what adhd is like 11 year old me god i 'm adorable looks up at dad again see how hopefully is he wants me to read the book i can tell he wants me to make an effort when i was a kid my dad was a cop he 's not a cop at this point mind you he 's a firefighter and as i stand there in the bookstore walls of great works towering around me and my dad 's great works practically wafting off him like a highway mirage i wonder what it must be like for a person like him to have a kid like me because it 's bizarre growing up with a larger-than-life father which just means he was a regular beat cop in uniform patrolling the streets and relentlessly pursuing leads then he added to forensics you know all the really gory stuff corpses fingerprints trace evidence digging up bodies autopsies snappy one-liners a weird career path to be sure but dad 's a weird guy he 's walked over now trying to act casual so i humor him and begin to lazily peruse the book he handed me and there right there on the second page is what a choice this book is going to let me choose if my idiot brain wants to run away with itself and pursue leads pursue what-ifs run down forgotten alleyways the book will actually encourage it unlike regular books and real life this story in my hands encourages do-overs i look up at dad wander in my eyes is real police work like this i ask holding the tiny paperback aloft dad looks down at me smiles a smile which upon reflection is a little too sad to burden the kid with and says no mate if i made a mistake when i was a book from me and kind of tunes out for a moment clearly thinking something over i just sort of watched the guy holding the book in his hands thinking he looks around the store smiles at me and heads to the counter he pulls out a huge leather wallet distended from a thousand compressed business cards crammed inside draws out a crinkled note smooths it and hands it to the cashier she rings up the purchase and dad hands me the book in a brown paper bag then we head home because of the unique yet exhausting way my brain works you 're going to have to keep up with my ricocheting between the present and the past now it 's 26 years later and my folks live somewhere else but it 's okay we 're still home they 're home we 're currently standing outside my parents cozy little apartment they 've lived here for a touch over a year and it 's so immaculate so carefully curated and stacked with artisanal minimalist pieces of design and art that you 'd be forgiven for thinking you 're standing in leave your shoes on just don 't drag any mud in we 'll just head down these stairs and knock them it 's okay don 't be nervous that is lovely weird but lovely those two things aren 't mutually exclusive at least not in my family what we 're about to do friends is sit down with dad and find out where i went astray if indeed that 's what i did why wasn 't i capable of doing what he did and why are we so different he 's a man of focus of drive of grit i 'm the exact opposite and that point of difference has been eating me up as much as i hate to admit it so i 'm here for answers i want to find out how dad made the hard choices and why i struggled to make even the simplest of choices was it the adhd was it cowardice and why did the apple fall so far from the tree here it comes it 's actually mum who opens the door mum actual name christine beams at me and envelops me in if she 's surprised to see me which is impossible because i called ahead i think what i 'm discovering as i get older is that mum is perpetually stoked to see me which is the kind of ambient affection that really keeps the emotional engine running on the low days she ushers me into the living room your father is driving the insane pool dad looks up currently the hero cop ex hero cop is leaning over refusing to bend his legs combing the tassels on a lavish persian rug with a hairbrush he looks up at me let 's try that again he looks up at me with an expression that says i know you want me to look ashamed about this but i 'm not ashamed about this these tassels were out of alignment this better not go in the book mate dad says aloud why would i put it in the book i reply calmly making a mental note to put it not just in the book but right near the start of the book so it sticks in everyone 's memory dad places the hairbrush drink ignores me when i tell him i 'd like a whiskey sour then sits he picks up a leather-bound moleskine carefully unwinding the elastic that binds the pages in place i told dad to take lots of notes on cases from his forensics years because they 're the years he never talked about i knew it would take him months to dredge this stuff up and if i 'm honest his notebook is practically creaking the damn thing is fit to burst and i realize he 's done to it what most men do to their wallets overstuffed it to the point where storing it in his jean pocket would give him a herniated disc it 's at this point that dad notices the book i bought it 's gift carefully swaddled in coarse brown paper and criss-crossed with frayed twine i hand it to him he weighs the package shaking it as if it was something other than a book did you wrap this he asks eyeing the small rectangular parcel yes i lie it was in fact wrapped by my wife tegan she has the kind of she avoided committing larceny in the past or having ex-cops for parents parents-in-law would be a jot awkward dad pulls the bow and the string cascades to either side with the soft he then peels away the paper just the top at first and stops peering out from the opening is the edge of a small paperback in a decidedly dated font bold and hugged by a red bar in other words choose your own adventure dad pauses and smiles at me i think i know what this is he says i 'll get to this tonight i is this the crime one yes i answer returning his smile the crime one he looks at it again a grateful expression playing across his face he then pops it down next to his notebook picks the warped object up and flicks to the first page where do you want to start well i reply i 'm trying to figure you out dad and i get why i didn 't end up in uniform it 's a i 'm a tremendous physical coward but forensics is details it 's sherlock holmes dusting 's perfect for me and yet even forensics wasn 't something i felt the pull to do i need to find out why i didn 't end up where you did dad so let 's begin at the beginning forensics it 's not car chases spreading after bad guys arrests it 's pretty basic right he looks like i just farted into his drink buckle up dear boy he glows smugly buckle up and that 's chapter one of electric blue so uh it then sort of spirals into this journey into what it was like for dad to be in forensics in the 1980s in australia but i really really really hope you enjoy it if you haven 't read lewis units do go back if you want to listen to the loose shooters podcast it 's on itunes it 's basically everywhere um right now dad and i are going through a season dealing with his time running a funeral home in the 90s i told you he had adhd like with his career and i think his uh his professions are proof of that anyway electric blue of this big silly funny violent book and um i really hope you like it pest your library uh to get as many copies as they can and to read it and if you want there 's also an audio book uh which dad has a cameo on anyway it 's been so lovely catching up with all of you and i hope you 're all enjoying your confinement uh if that 's even possible um thank you so much to the library for letting me do this talk and i hope i can visit in person soon i 'm paula hovind see you later you _"

    "text": "hi everyone my name is maria and i 'm here at canterbury aquatic leisure centre and i am presenting this very short video on you through the cbc channel on facebook i 've been absent for a little while so i hope you have missed me as i have missed you and today i 'm going to do a very short workout using some bands that i have here now you can buy bands from most retail outlets you know even big w kmart target rebel of course you don 't have to spend a lot of money these are crossfit kind of bands but that doesn 't matter and they are so versatile you can do so many things with them so today i 'm going to show you a very short video to work on what we call our back extensors so support our middle and lower back as well as utilize our abdominal and our core muscles which our core muscles are the abdominal abdominal muscles that sit beneath our tummy muscles that we normally refer to as our rectus abdominis and these muscles you can 't body but they are very part important part of maintaining your spine and allowing you to perform all the various movements that you need to perform inside a workout and outside of an exercise workout so working on the core muscles the deep core muscles that we refer to as transverse abdominis and the other one but i can 't remember right now but i can look it up um of really important things and that will definitely save you some um you know issues and injuries and potential problems later on by continuing to work on them in your workout so let 's get started so in this particular range of bangs the black is the most difficult so as you put the band on make sure that the band does not sit on the kneecap that 's very important make sure the band sits above the kneecap so we 're going to do some squats and as always make sure that before you begin your workout that you have your mat tail and some water that you go at your own pace and you get doctor 's clearance time and just make sure that you do work at your own pace there is no pressure to keep up with me you 've got to work safely and enjoy the experience so feet are hip width apart that 's important so we set that good alignment we 're already pushing the knees out slightly and i 'll tell you why because that will activate your outer thigh and that will activate your inner thigh and add to that your butt muscles automatically just like that you don 't even have to think about it your body will automatically start to contract those muscles and pull you up nice and tall so now we have outer inner butt muscles engaged and my abdominal muscles are engaged so let 's begin hands to hips stand tall crown of the head to the ceiling we 're going to take two steps out to this other mat one and then two good and you 'll notice that i come back with my feet hip width apart so when you do this make sure that you have your feet hip with the pump that color of expenditure let 's go two squats to our left all in that direction one and two cool so now that you 've got that let 's set up target for this we 're going to do how about 30 30 is a good number i 'm going to add a variation arms out in front there we go just like that so one two three four stay with me five six seven and now take a breath inhale and exhale come up tall so crown of the head to the ceiling and inhale and exhale and don 't cheat i 'm watching you you 're going to do 30 squats with me so we 're going to use a lot of leg muscles for this now remember the wider you go the harder it is so you need to judge how wide you want that squat and of course the color of the band that you choose the darker the color the more intense the the harder the workout is you 're probably thinking this is feeling like 30. i don 't think it 's 30. so we from now one two you hear that cycle of breath inhale exhale inhale exhale last two good job let 's take the band off bend the knees slip it off from the heels to the front so look after your bands okay so a little bit of tuft and powder wipe the perspiration hang them up in a cool dry place maintain the longevity and quality of your band let 's do some workout on our glutes and our back extensors come down with me to the full so for this one i 'm going to pick green again make sure that you place the band bottom kneecap so the bridge is a really popular movement it 's done in yoga it 's done in pilates it 's done all forms of exercise workouts no different for us using a van lying down on your mat take your knees hip width apart same as your feet and if you can reach the back of your shoe that is the alignment we want rest your arms by the side and eyes to ceiling now we 're going to peel our back through the glutes and squeeze with the back of the thigh and then exhale to come down how is that to make this a little bit intense let 's go fraction wider let 's go up together inhale and then exhale gently good let 's do that again watch the change inhale squeeze the knees in exhale inhale and then release let 's do that again inhale exhale inhale exhale let 's do that again inhale tuck the knees in and then exhale good so two really simple exercises we did 30 squats let 's do 30 bridges let 's go you want to hear yourself breathing through your exercise movement so you know that you are actively engaging your chest muscles your abdominal muscles and your back ribs i can hear you say that 's 30 no it 's not i think that 's probably about six or seven so let 's go to 30. this is great workout for our legs great workout for our butt muscles and great workout for our lower back now only lift as high as you 're comfortable so this height for you it lower but what we don 't want to do is this see that arch of my spine that 's going to put pressure on your vertebrae it 's like crunching your vertebrae not good not safe so we want to keep the hips just below the knee okay so you might want to do a little check from time to time how do you check just lift and look but your hips are below the kneecap so where are we up to team are you counting i think we 're probably about 25 let 's do five more now ideally breathing through nose and then out through mouth okay and if the cycle of breath gets confusing that 's cool just breathe make it work for you but do something so that 's 30 so you 've done 30 squats and 30 bridges now that will probably take you 5 10 maybe 15 minutes if you go slower the cool thing about that is there really is no excuse to say that you don 't have time to do a little bit of workout you can do that anytime a towel a mat that you 're in a great place to begin your exercise workout go at your own pace get your doctor 's clearance this is maria from canterbury aquatic leisure center posting this video on cb city channel it 's all for the moment but watch out for the more videos that will come plus a surprise i have coming your way with a celebrity in the video bye for now _"

    "text": "it 's good to be here for this special NATO edition of CB TV with Arnie Lennon and Uncle Harry and we should start by acknowledging country and Amelie could you welcome to country please the Jarrah for Rangga good morning where am I mingi la hora de Nagar Oh ah John boutté Google welcome to all the people can you please listen to the spirits I would like to pay my respects to our ancestors and all elders for their keeping and passing on of the knowledge about dream time through song dance and art this week is NAIDOC and although we are not able to gather celebrate and share our history and culture everyone is attempting to acknowledge the fact in new and inventive ways this land always was is and always will be Aboriginal land what am i did you are Yannick John Dalli all the world mangani welcome to our land Derek land and thank you for walking with me and sharing my dreaming thanks Arnie Lyn it 's always good to think carefully and remember where we are you just mentioned the theme of night the thinking you remind us again about the art it 's always was always will be every we should welcome it carries on to be Aboriginal and that they 're just using always wise always yeah which could do with a bit of an explanation because some people I think most people would have read it or heard that 's all it 's something but there are those out there that do not realize what it means yes yeah that 's find whenever I read that phrase always was always will be my mind immediately says yes yeah which is so it would be wonderful to have that that phrase embedded in our in our minds and in our imagination and that 's where you 're a welcome to country is really important because having you here reminds us of the endurance of us all on our land yes it does and they can be different contexts with that say or me you know I have read and I have the same Facebook juice about the fact I guess it 's that original land they just want to take it and there is more behind it which has got a lot to do with our family and culture and where we came from yeah yeah so the more we talk about it the more we can share the stories and the more we can make it belong to all of us in Australia I think it 's interesting to think about NAIDOC week this year because although this is historically NAIDOC week the activities have been postponed isn 't that right Uncle Harry we 've had a postponement of the NAIDOC week activities can you tell us a bit about that yes we have been certainly guarded by the National made up committee and they have come back and sort of advised the wider communities through Illustrated that NAIDOC week has had special significance to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people not only does it give us the opportunity to showcase our culture to the wider community but also the opportunity for our families and organizations to come together and be proud of our culture history and achievement made of national a dark week 2020 celebrations will now be held November day to follow the decision by the National made of committee to postpone date up with from the original July dates due to the impacts and uncertainty from the escalating corona virus pandemic across our communities and cities the postponement was aimed at protecting our elders and those in our communities with chronic health issues from the disastrous impacts of covert 19 as cooler weather approaches the need to protect our most susceptible remains further announcements regarding that national made our awards and the reactivation of the 2020 made up local grants room will be made within coming weeks the NNC understand that the July days were made up may still be known by two men disappeared all those nations however we are mindful that those celebrations and physical gatherings will still be impacted by the various state and territory covered 19 restriction and social distance measures we also acknowledge that the commitment and tireless work of the many committees organization and individuals in our local government areas especially chair made makes me look weak and apathetic successful we thank you for your understanding and working with us during LGA to ensure that we will be able to come together in November to make NAIDOC week 2020 a suitable and fitting celebration of the thing always was always will be and I think that 's a great message to come across to our wider community who knew that we 've been in these circumstances thinking about that time but it gives us plenty of time to look at where we are yeah yeah so we miss we miss our July activities here for Nate Oakley well we doing we done it we 're missing our big event that we normally hold yeah but here we 're doing this fall on behalf of the committee and we also did hold an online children 's art competition and a lot of the different councils and organizations are doing things and we mustn 't say to schools for instance they 're not to celebrate NAIDOC week now they can 't have their biggest families they kind of the big shows and dances and everything like that but there are still ways and means that the teachers can imbibe the idea of NAIDOC this is something in a minutes there 's a lot up there on Facebook there are various organizations that are putting things out various councils are doing it in a different way there are still art exhibitions being held and most of the art galleries are open with restrictions right but they are open and they are presenting an original artwork for NAIDOC isn 't that terrific so I think in fact what we 've just revealed is that there 's a second meaning to that always was and always will be thing I think what we 've just revealed is that always was and always will be NAIDOC week in the first week of July regardless of where coronavirus is or what kind of restrictions were experiencing that first this first week of July always was and always will be a week of celebrating our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures our people resilience our endurance on country and it is really good to be able to get out of our space restrictions and be able to come together and and have this amazing talk about what it means on country on what always was and always will be Aboriginal land so I thought the other thing to do in native week as we celebrate our culture 's our history our politics our survival that it 's a good moment to reflect on the uluru statement from the heart this is an action and movement as we try to get to get some traction moving towards changing the constitution and here in our canterbury Bankstown local area i was really pleased to think about our historic connection that woollahra wory been along was long gone he lived here in this country and he was one of the first proponents of recognition of average people to the British when they first arrived on the first fleet and then of course up into the into 1933 when Uncle Joe Anderson delivered his incredible speech over there on the backs of salt pan Creek where he said all we want is representation in federal parliament because there 's plenty of fish in the river for a soil and plenty of land to grow all we want and so he promoted that idea about the order is statement from the hardest to think about the our connection for this country to this next I think important moment of nationhood and so this is what the audio statement from the heart says it says we gathered at the 2017 national constitutional convention coming from all points of the southern sky make this statement from the heart our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander tribes were the first sovereign nations of the Australian continent and it 's adjacent islands and possessed it under our own laws and customs this our ancestors did according to the reckoning of our culture from the creation according to the common law from time immemorial and according to science more than 60,000 years ago this sovereignty is a spiritual nation the ancestral time between the land or mother nature and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who are born there from remain attached thereto and must one day return thither to be reunited with our ancestors this link is the basis of this ownership of the soil or better of sovereignty it has never been seeded or extinguished and it be otherwise the peoples possessed this land for 60 millennia and this sacred link disappears nearly in the last 200 years with substantive constitutional change and structural reform we believe this ancient sovereignty can shine through as a fuller expression of our Australian nationhood proportionally we are the most incarcerated people on the planet we are not Nate Li criminal people our children are aliens from their fair is that unprecedented rates this cannot be because we have no love for them and our youth languish in detention in obscene numbers they should be our hope for the future these dimensions of our crisis tell plainly the structural nature of our problem it is the torment of our powerlessness we seek constitutional reforms to empower our people and take a rightful place in our country when we have power over our destiny our children will flourish they will walk in two worlds and their culture will be a gift to the country we call for the establishment of a First Nations voice enshrined in the Constitution maca Rada is the culmination of our agenda the coming together after a struggle with the people of Australia and a better future for our children based on justice and self-determination we seek I 'm a karateka mission to supervise a process of agreement making between governments and First Nations and truth-telling about our history in 1967 we were counted in 2017 we seek to be heard we leave base camp and start our trek across this vast country we invite you to walk with us in a movement of the Australian people for a better future very good and again like these Springs respect to always was always will be our land what people don 't realize that they hear every time people talk about their country and they think they just mean this country but here in Australia there are over 400 I don 't know how many 60 nations right throughout Australia but they refer to that nation with the land is on as their country it 's not just a matter of they the law they own that country or they belong to that country that country is also part of them yes it 's part of this spirituality it and you get people that have they 're off their land they 're off their country it may be because they actually have moved themselves but a lot of times it 's because they have actually been removed as children and taken somewhere else they 'd lost their country they 've lost their culture they 've lost them as they grow up there 's always something missing and because we do with a lot of children a lot of people that have had this happen to them we realized that what they 're missing is their country and it 's absolutely wonderful to see them go back on country on their own country because it 's like a great weight has been lifted off them yes nd home so again it brings us back to what this theme is all about it means a lot more than indigenous First Nation people owning this land I think the word that you use constantly there is belonging yes is about below me and Uncle Harry you know how good you feel when you get back on country it 's a wonderful feeling your life takes you away from it but it 's always in your heart and you always have that desire and many people if circumstances are there they were always continually go back to country and and just to see and today the memories and stories that were passed down over many many times yeah yep hard to get back to country at the moment but we carry it in our hearts and we look forward to getting there so lucky its I always stay on my country that 's right so thank you for sharing country to the sunny minute thank you for sharing country and kind of a happy night off way kinder than happy night off waiting Uncle Harry it 's good to be _"

    "text": "guess you ate that surprise because it 's lesson number 22 two two rudy with a stagger as i used to say in the old beer bingo days hahaha but no if b lesson number 22 we be back we 'll be back again and again and again keep going for 22 dollars it 's like that birthday thing is he won no is he to know and by the end of you go my goodness will he just stop but no we 're here at 22 higher put them all together and they indeed do spell r i figured you 'd be ready to answer that question they just see now and they go r and r what 's that spell you 'll be there going oh that 's it because all those guys they 'll finish in school ready to study and put their pirate knowledge to good news i imagine don 't forget to write answers on the back of your patch that 's what i always say all right so what are we doing today oh we 're doing all manner of things we 're looking i thought i 'd start with a few more of these wordy things you know talking to things like you heard the expression empty your coffers as i mean like give all your money away or spend all your money and all that kind of stuff you know that well coffee right that 's what i used to call a treasure chest right does that make sense empty your coffers just empty your treasure chest right so that 's where that comes from is the tariff and the gangplank people talk about the gang blank you know they think about walking the gang black and all that kind of stuff the blank green well the gang plank if you get your ferry and that kind of stuff now you 'll see it all right that 's just the ramp they the movable ramp they put out down to the wharf so you can walk in the aisle easy right so you have to climb down ropes and wipe myself you just go up the gangplank right and then just pull it in and pull it out and that 's what the gangplank that meant they 'd put it out and you 're walking out and fall into the sea because there 's nothing on the other side you know that was the punishment they just took it off and but generally the gangplank is just that bit there like that another expression you would have heard right is many hands make light work you heard that one many hands make like work you think oh yeah that sort of makes sense a lot of stuff well if you think maritime boys right party boys makes even more sense because hands is what we call sailors right they call their hands the ship the ship 's hands right that 's what you know do that so many hands make like work so you 've got more people doing the job it goes faster that 's what it 's all about many hands make light work another cellular tab ah we 've heard this from stem to stern right you 've stem disturbed remember we would talk about your port remember your starboard you know the bow and the arf well the at the bow of the ship right it 's the piece of wood that goes up at the front and all the boards attached to it that 's the stem so it 's a very pointy bit of the ship from stem to stern means the whole thing if you 're doing something from step to stern that 's covering the whole thing right another thing you might have you heard that actually maritime is wallop you know what about giving things a good warp have you ever i mean it 's a kind of tactile word right so you feels like well it feels like something you can actually do right it feels like you 're slapping them or something that goes clocks in their head but you know you don 't think you should i think i 'm going to say maybe like a cutlass but cut this is more of a clang than a womp well that 's more like one of those like a bland pin actually if you could wall up somebody with a bigger pin i reckon so that pull up it 's on you when you do it you 're swinging into things right that 's how i always like to swing into these things right so yeah wallop so what where does wallop come from well back back back way way way way back right the french they burned down the city of brighton they burned it down right little dusty boogers they were all right they burnt it down and king henry viii was in charge of england that time and he got quite gnarky about it right and so he went to an admiral and says i want you to take vengeance on the french and you know what that vengeance that well you know what the arrow 's name was who got a vengeance right his name was admiral wallop and he gave him a right wallop and he did did so much damage that ever after that whenever he gave everybody a good clock on the side of that they call it a warp and he 's like so that 's an interesting one as well i 'm not sure if i 've done taken aback before it by stuff and that was the old square riggers all right so when the sails lost wind or the wind change and they flat back against the the mars there like that all right and the arms and all that sort of stuff right when they did that that would be back there the yard arm and all that sort of stuff so when it flap back right that was when you were taking it back because the ship would actually jolt backwards and all that kind of stuff and that 's where that expression getting taken aback comes from another expression right another expression that you might have heard a word use a lot is fluke all right what is a fluke well fluke 's got no definitions but you know what anchors right you know the shape of anchors they go down like that right and they curl at the bottom and then they 've got little triangly bits on the end remember if you ever see one just sitting outside or a picture of one you 're looking like a little triangly bit on the end of bits right they 're called the flukes right they 're flukes all right and they 're the bits when you throw all the anchor in right it 's the flukes that actually grab all the stuff right and they catch up and that 's what stops the ship from moving right because it grabs all of the ground and stays here but those things are called flukes right and when you 're putting an anchor in right it doesn 't always catch oh being a friend mikey right we had a tail and chipped me and mikey right we 've gone off right we partnered there left it all anchored it 's only a little swoop right we 've gone off quite happily you know gone for a swim done all sorts of things hang around a bit of a picnic and all sorts of things right now we wandered back to the ship and going hey that ship isn 't it funny you know with this side we look at the seeing you know different light makes things seem further away than they did before and now we looked anchor and it kept floating away and it was floating right over the other side of the bay we were in it was heading towards the rocks so we run like maniacs running around right like maniacs jumped in a robot right jumped in a rope boat and then we paddled we paddled we put on wind pedal we finally went pedal with pedal pedal pedals and more and some more like that i was teaching you in lesson two three whatever that was right and we 've grazed along eventually just jumped in the boat just managed to save her right from coming up on the rocks all right and that 's because it got pretty fluky there and i didn 't hook up right but that 's where flute comes from it 's actually from the anchors right there 's little things there that catch on right what about there she blows there 's another one you 've heard there she blows when you see something coming that 's an obvious one too that 's the whales because you see whales right and spouts go up there she that kind of stuff oh and pooped you 've been pooped exhausted hard enough right well the poop right the poop deck at the back of the ship right when it 's got the raised bed up at the back where i 've got it on the beach if you 've seen the pirate ships there right the old ships where they 've got the raised deck at the back that 's the poop deck right the poop is actually the back part of the ship right by that bit of a back to the stern right it 's a deck to the stern and they 're right there 's a poop deck right and so where pooped becomes you the ship becomes pooped like they 're exhausted and what kind of stuff right if you 're sailing before the wind right which means this winds behind you right in a gale and so you get there you 'll go flat out the wind 's behind your left side if the wood the water should crash over the back of the boat right that expression for that is you 're because it 's down there and submerges and it stops and when you lose all the wind and it 's just like being exhausted you just collapse and all that kind of stuff and you 're in a bright bit of trouble if you get pooped and that 's where that comes from all right another naval expression it 's using all sorts of things like being exhausted and all that kind of stuff and so you know that 's what 's sort of where it all comes from now the last thing i was going to talked about was a bit of a water sale and stuff right is ballast right what is ballast right sorry well ballast right so this ship in here right is not gut battles you can see you see how high europe is in the water right it 's quite higher than the water right so when you load up a ship it sinks right because it gets more in it and sinks right down and just places the water right and it keeps it above flow right but it floats that goes down the water you can see like that 's the little pencil line across there right there some clever blinder worked out how much you can load the shift that it 's actually balanced for sale in right for that kind of stuff one tip not so tippy because if you 're out of the water then you 've got more services you become more tippy and more in balance right because it 's too much weight on top so you really ideally you need to be down under this blimsol line right that 's where it is quite cool principle developed all that and so when you load it up when you 're full of goods and stuff and treasure and all sorts of things like that well you naturally sink down to that level right but if you 're not going to treasure and when you 're going out and all that what we used to do is get stuff called ballast right which is basically big heavy stuff right big heavy stuff put in the whole other ship down the bottom and that would reduce us down so 's how you 'd say the best way because you 're full of balance right modern ships use water they pump in water and pump out water and all that kind of stuff but old days we used to use heavy stuff right every stuff in fact if you go to newcastle right harbor newcastle up there right the top part there right in stone there 's a big bit of there and that whole land there is actually all ballast right the ships used to come over right from california places like that and go sail around and they would actually empty out all their balance they come over and pick up coal over there and they would dump it all out there and then fill up with coal and go back again and so they end up using all that and to make it to redevelop right but that 's what ballast is right you never hear about ballast right it 's just heavy stuff that weighs you down and you have it in chips like that it makes you feel better if you 're down on that more unstable and a lot closer you don 't want to tip over and all that kind of stuff then we talk about tipping over here now i am going to talk now about mermaids and monsters all right marines as well some of the legends of the deep mermaids and watches so i 'm going to talk about mermaids first all right now what is a mermaid a lot of people talk about mermaids so a mermaid basically if you if you 've been hiding under a rock maybe you 're a crab or it or something like that and you might notice mermaid is an aquatic creature with the head and body of a person and then like a fishy tail at the bottom right fishy tail at the bottom right and mermaid right um is an old water now all word right for the sea verb means c in the old english height and made means less of course lasts and it still does right you still mean glass still does all right mermaids or mermaid that 's what it is right that 's where that comes relationship humans with mermaids you know we see them as good and bad right they 're either you know the sign of beauty healing wisdom oh they 're monstrously evil and violent and all that sort of stuff and that kind of stuff and uh revenge fallen you know danger and all that kind of stuff they know all that kind of things like that they 're already taking sailors to their doom that 's the kind of thing they are good and bad they seem like that kind of thing remember the story right the story of alexander alexander the great all right he was a great soldier right now that took over paul the no world at the time right back then in ancient times i used to do that well his sister was supposed to have passed away right and when she passed away she became a mermaid right and she used to stop ships and she would ask them how is alexander right and the ship 's captains would have to say alexander is going well he lives and he 's conquered the world and if they didn 't she 'd call a big storm and smite the ship and smash it all up and that 's what she would do and that was that kind of relationship see that violence and all that kind of and there 's so many countries like they 're either they 're either you know goddesses or saurons leading us to our doom and the ceilings and all that kind of stuff there 's all sorts of things we had with them and all over the world they had legends of them right the greeks the romans the russians southeast asia everywhere basically had you know the scottish the irish they 'd all have these legends of mermaids so they 're all over the place everybody had them didn 't matter they grew up separately but they all had these stories of mermaids right sailors we love them right well we have them as figurines right up the front of the beatrice there you might not be able to see it there 's just a little pale shape there of our figurehead right the figurehead is that the front of there and looks real a lot and figure out i think i covered it in the word stuff before about where it comes from and all that kind of stuff but that was it we 'd have him there and we 'd hope that the mermaid would give us safe passage through the sea and bring us hot back home and that 's why the mermaid was there right the old figurehead okay so now modern people think that maybe the mermaid right was actually people getting confused with the sea cows the dugons and the manda uh manatees oh the huge manatees that 's what the manatees because they be big big fish right that used to eat things around the water they 'd be vegetarian type diets and all that stuff they 'd be around all the time and there 's lots of similarities between them and the mermaids and i think maybe there 's mistakes because you know especially the dugons right they 've got down face like you know how poor person that have noses that are pointy well they don 't their head faces are so there 's that kind of thing and they didn 't have any any hind limbs right they just had a pair of flippers at the front but no hind limbs and they were smooth right and they were very pale skin especially when they were young i had no dorsal fin at the back like you know the sharks and the dolphins had none of that sort of stuff right so they were smooth they said they had that more shape basically the shape of a human look in there and they 're sort of an hourglass figure as well they had that sort of shape so they thought they 'd be human you like that and also right they 'd be mammals so they fade their young milk right and not like cows and that where they have like four teats they 'd have two teeth like a like a human person right so they would look like a human feeding their younger that kind of stuff so maybe that 's what their confusion comes from when they 're feeding their young they used to see the sailors and that 's maybe there was and they 're usually in the shallows as well right so that 's where they could be lured into the shallows because if you see them feeding there and you think it 's deeper it 's actually quite shallow because they 're quite big arms but it 's quite shallow as he used to keep him so maybe that was a dangerous thing and that 's what they thought it was and there was also the curious and smart creatures so they would actually go around the ships and check them out and see what was going on and and they would know they had memories and stuff like that and everything so maybe they came back to the same ship regularly and you can see how a mermaid thing could have developed right that sort of legend of the murray rays or maybe that 's true who knows all right and when we 're now we 've done with mermaids also we 'll talk about that most fierce of beastie the most scariest of all these legendary creatures the kraken right now the probably know all about the kraken ah all the cracking he has to be a scary beasty with lots of limbs all these limbs about and he could reach up higher than the marsh and they would grab the ships and drag them back down and eat all the all the sailors and all that kind of stuff and be very scary sort of thing even the water when there was gonna be swimming abraham they would create these whirlpools or big washes of sea they would cause and knock ships and knock people overboard and all that kind of stuff so the crack can be a scary scary beastie right early on right lots of legends on these two right back ancient greeks as well people would see it in them early days they thought it was more crab like in the creatures then became more of the octopus later on they thought they might have been giant squids you 've been wrestling with whales and stuff like that but the kraken be a legendary scary b star who would talk about right that kind of stuff you know you know it could well be in things like pirates trying to scare people off we talked about black beard there was people now if we didn 't want people to come to our treasure islands we 'd like to talk to people and to build up the story of it you 're not going to travel there because all the sirens will get you all the crack at all get yourself the more you spread these stories the better it is in fact matt maybe mac maples map makers as they say in the land ah sometimes you get a bit of fish caught the back of your head and that 's like slap on the back side with the fish and guess it clears you up but all right map makers right where there was bits of land right if they had a bit of land uh you know where there was a bit of when they were doing the big sea maps and like the old map makers right if they had a better area right that might be rocky and ships could run around a lot on the map right and if they had a place that was known for its storms and people trips being lost and all that kind of stuff like bermuda triangle or places like that well then they 'd have a picture of the kraken on there right there so the people looking at the map will go oh i don 't want to go there if i could calm the crack and all that but really it was just sibling places of danger and all that kind of stuff but something else some say i still believe it they say right that captain blackbear 's log had a message in there about seeing iron maids in one particular place and said we should never sell there because there are mermaids there and all that kind of stuff of course me myself i 've never seen a mermaid i reckon it 's because any time i get close the mermaid gets embarrassing swims off because it sees my ship 's bottom ah anyway that be some of the mysteries and marvels you can have to see all these things we have we 're covering all this in our classes and we 've done 22 so i think you should give yourself a clap because that round of applause all that sort of stuff because you survived this long i don 't know how you survived this long we 've been in block down they 're finding reasons why we should get out of it one of them is because otherwise these party things will just keep on going and going are we going to mermaids and cracking where to next where to next that 's something i ask myself every day but right now i think it 's time i point this all down and we kick back for a bit of relaxing maybe we 'll sing a shanty or listen to a or do something like that or maybe we 'll just put our feet up and have a little dr room just to relax in the evening but for now i 'd like to say good night or as i have done a few times around erchi which be italian for i guess see you later but i 'm end of lesson number 22 23 next year are 23 lucky lucky 23 we always say not sure why but i always say it and i 've said it again so that makes it always good boy _"

    "text": "we are today um meeting to discuss starting school with ease it 's a difficult subject for a lot of parents but um i 'd like to say that with madeleine winter from hand-in-hand parenting it will be an easier journey although we we all know it is a difficult one so today i will hand over to madeleine winter and hopefully by the end of this hour and a half we will learn some things to make it also much easier thank you madeleine thanks anita [Laughter] i 'm very pleased to be here um welcome to starting school with ease i guess it 's how we all hope it will happen and um before we begin uh you 're on silent and anita who you 've already met is my assistant if you need help use the chat function and we if we have time we will take questions at the end so you can send your questions to anita again using the chat function um on zoom and she 'll have a look at them read them out and we 'll see if we can tackle them traditional custodians of the land on which i sit which today is the wongal people which is where i live they 're elders past present and emerging and um i acknowledge that indigenous cultures thrives and survives and that we have all gained an enormous amount from what they have lost so this is where i like to start which is the truth about you as parents we um find it it 's very easy for us to feel uh bad about our parenting and the truth is that you are a good parent and that you have always done the very best that you can if everything 's taken into account and as a parent you face real struggles and difficulties and you 're not to blame for these and around seeing us starting schools our topic um today around the issue of school the whole business about the pandemic the periods we 've had um where we 've been doing school from home um the transition to school will all be a whole lot more disrupted than and and and all of those things have been hard and who may still be in lockdown those are really hard things parents are not well thought about in how those things get rolled out just well parents are often not all that well thought about but many things were not thought thought well about and we end up having to try and negotiate the effects of all of that in the privacy of our own home and it 's really easy to feel that it 's our fault that things aren 't going well but it 's often more about the pressures that are being put on us and the circumstances that we 're being landed in and you know we did not choose to be well some of us chose to school our children at home but most of us did not and it 's a huge you know challenge and learning curve and it 's true i can guarantee you that someday you will get a little rest and here is um my dear husband who spends a bit of time on this couch it 's our friend 's couch he often has a little snooze anyway it so we are recording this um webinar and you will at some point um canterbury council will um put it up on the website and you 'll get a link to that but after the webinar we 'll send you out an email which has a has a link to my website with a whole lot of resources that you may find helpful some stories more information other resources you 'll find helpful and i love to actually talk to real people and have conversations about parenting one of the things about the webinar process is that it often doesn 't involve the back and forth that makes things really fun so i 'm really happy to chat with you and you can book a free 20-minute consultation i can get a better sense of what 's what the challenges are in your family and um figure out how i can point you in the direction of some resources that will help so do feel free to set something up with me and you can learn more there 's my website that 's a link to the page that you information about starting school and about how our hand-in-hand approach tackles that parenting challenge and it 's a big one uh you can join my mailing list and i offer courses and resources and coaching and advice and groups so have a chat with me to find out so we all make mistakes um as parents i mean we make mistakes all of us all the time but but it 's impossible to parent perfectly and we have the very best of attention of intentions and the very biggest of hearts um and but sometimes we head out without really planning or knowing the territory that we 're about to embark on and sometimes things go wrong i love this set of slides so uh my goal is to help you avoid um some of those things you might call parenting fails but in particular to help you recover from where things have not gone quite right and as parents i think we 're almost biologically predisposed to be wanting to fix things and wanting to try and protect our families and and avoid difficulty but difficulty is almost unavoidable we need ways of recovering and the hand-in-hand listening tools some of which i will talk to you about today are a really fantastic way of getting in good shape before you start school but also dealing with the challenges that come up around it and a little bit of information about me i 've done many different things it took me a long time to figure out that i wanted to be a parent better late than never i wish i 'd done it earlier i wouldn 't recommend leaving it as late as i did but it 's the best thing i 've ever done i 've worked with hand in hand for over 30 years for many years with other people 's children and then when i had my own [Music] the whole thing made a different kind of sense so i was inspired by the way that my daughter knew what to do and the way that this framework for understanding what 's going on just made sense of what was happening and i also found that i was really quickly wanting to connect with other parents really is a great way to get support for myself really as a parent to to kind of counter the isolation that goes with parenting and here is my darling little family here 's my lovely daughter i think that must be about seven years ago she 's now 16 and we have a very sweet relationship my aim today is to talk with you about your special role as a parent about which is different i think it 's important to say that it 's different from being your child 's teacher there 'll be times where you step into that role and many of us have been pushed into that role in the last six months but it 's a very different role and as a parent there 's there 's it 's important to understand how incredibly influential and powerful you are in supporting your child through transitions and it 's a role that i mean any person who 's really close to a child can take on but most of us are that person so we can get the information we can get the tools give our children a hand and i 'll talk today about so you know when your child goes to school you have uh you pack the backpack and you 're probably thinking about uh you know a nutritious lunch a spare pair of underpants um a number of other things that you would put in the backpack what i want to talk about is the emotional backpack and how you can um build a sense of connection that will carry your child through their school day and then at the other end of the day you 'll be unpacking the backpack so you 'll be taking out the dirty undies and emptying the lunch box but in your special role as a parent what what you 'll be doing is unpacking the emotional baggage from the day and handling upsets and that 's part of the job and you can get information and the listening tools that hand-in-hand teach that i teach will really help you with that and i 'd like to talk a little bit about getting support for yourself the transition to school either either preschool both but you know the beginning of primary school um is is one of those transitions in a family 's life that 's a really big deal and we need a place where we can get the support we need to think well about it and and and help our child the way we want to so to talk a little bit about your special role as a parent um you can be confident that the caring that you show and the connection that you build with your child and the listening that you do to their upsets and concerns are what will give your child the support and build the resilience that they need in order to survive whatever school or anything else serves up so you can spend a lot of time looking for the right school you 'll spend time building relationships around school with teachers and other families and sometimes you 'll need to go in and bat for or advocate for your children but basically your your the degree to which you can pack that backpack with connection and unpack whatever your child brings home is will make the difference and listening tools will really help so hand-in-hand parenting takes a look at treats all of these issues around parenting in with a perspective or or looking at your whole relationship with your child and between you and your child um that relationship is going to be balanced between um correction which we might think about as setting limits when things have gone off track and connection on the other hand which is is extremely important to human beings good functioning and we teach some child-directed tools that are used child-directed play and we teach parents how to listen to children 's feelings and what that will do is restore a child 's thinking but listening well to a child 's feelings will very deeply help their sense of connection with you i call this the love triangle and at its foundation so you have correction on one side connection on the other and and at its core at its foundation is the support for you and i 'll talk a bit about that later um basically all of this works to build emotional safety into free to bring their upsets and concerns and worries to you and so that they know really know that they have your backing i like to think about the process of your relationship with your child as a kind of bank balance and what 's in um what 's in what the credit in that bank balance is um connection and when there 's plenty of collect connection in your relationship with your child um you 'll find that it 's characterized by closeness and cooperation when the connection credits are low what you 'll find is that your relationship is characterized by a lot of struggles and you 'll find that you 're having to set a lot of limits and commonly when we hit difficulties in our relationship with our child and there 's things going on that we 'd like to have go different um commonly we 'll focus on on limit setting on trying to be firmer with our children and and there 's a real place for firmness it needs to be combined with warmth but often the problem is actually a connection problem and might have gotten broken is a really important thing to do and in terms of the transition to school um school tends to focus more on the corrections side of things particularly at the beginning when your children don 't yet have um confidence a lot of information about how it all works um or relationships they haven 't yet built relationships at school um that that schools tend to be emphasizing the sort of limit setting and correction side so they 'll be characterized by a lot of rules a lot of routines and a general sense of getting on with it and that 's partly because of the ratios even in the most enlightened school with the best you know stated sort of best practice in terms of teaching techniques and best teachers in the world who are supported the best they just aren 't the ratios of adults to children to allow much more than a fairly sort of regimented process of of getting through the day to make sure everything 's covered off so through the transition to school what home can provide is the balance is to focus on connection at least through this period with as i said child directed play which i 'll talk about it 's a wonderful listening tool called special time and time making time to [Music] listen to your child 's feelings making time for your child to have feelings and in order to manage this process you really need support um parenting reminds us of our own experiences as children and including our experience as and we don 't need to actually remember what those experiences were in order to be affected by them a lot of uh what 's happened to us to us has been laid down in implicit memory what 's known as implicit memory which is where it sits there it sits there waiting to be triggered by some experience in the present but it won 't come up um as a as a as a memory um it will come up as a set of feelings um so just briefly uh when my daughter started school i was really agitated and upset and i had made a friend in the process as you we call a listening partnership which is which i 'll talk about in a minute but it 's basically swapping time listening to one another in a organized way and we both worked on how we were feeling about our children starting school and what turned up was that i eventually i figured out that when i was at the age my daughter was about six my parents went to live overseas in a country where we didn 't speak the language and we were really isolated and that was quite traumatic experience for me and something about taking my child to school brought that up um and i was really in bad shape and i could kind of tell somehow that like i would get very worried for my daughter but i could kind of tell that the worry really she was fine the worry didn 't seem to relate very well to what was happening to her and it turned out that it was about me so we have old feelings that get pulled up by all sorts of experiences in the present and we also have a school um commonly children are struggling with separation feelings but at least as often i think we are as well so we teach a listening partnership if we were in a room together which maybe one day soon we will be we could have a practice of this but basically it 's a timed turn-taking listening time you find a partner you decide who 'll listen first you decide how long you 've got and you split it in half and when the timer timer goes off you use a timer so you don 't have to worry about the time you swap over so initially one person listens and the other person tells their story and then you swap over so the person who told their story becomes the listener and when you 're listening there 's a few tricks we need to offer people warmth and our full attention and it 's different from a conversation so we really need to be careful not to interrupt or give advice um as we 're as we 're listening there 's plenty of advice for parents there 's um not oops spend time um talking about how we feel and the other really important thing there is to keep it confidential so what is said in the listening partnership partnership stays there and we don 't mention it again to the person we 've listened to and we don 't go talking about it to anyone else that makes it safe for us to talk about how things really are without being kind of concerned that it 'll get spread around and that will be judged so the kind of things you might have a chance to talk about uh how you feel about your child starting school about your own memories of learning your children being in a learning formal learning environment and struggling with learning new things will bring up your own experiences of that and some of us were really successful learners and telling those stories of what you loved learning will actually help but many of us also have experiences of learning that were really hard i know when my daughter was letting the times tables i was thrust back to a really hideous experience of the room for fear of being chosen because i hadn 't learnt them so you will also probably as i 've just said i had memories of starting school yourself and all of those things are worth talking about because they 'll be lurking around there affecting how we feel and if you get to do a listening partnership on a regular basis you 'll notice you 'll you 'll have a chance to notice your efforts and your successes and how much you care we spend a lot of time thinking about what we have done wrong and you will spend time on that in listening partnerships but you know this is such a big job any other job you would have colleagues and supervisors so you get a chance to notice how well you 're doing you get a chance to think about what you would like to change you get a chance to work through some of the tensions of everyday life i know that i do not parent as well when i 'm under pressure myself and having a chance to talk about that makes a of explore your own reactions and feelings and stories plus you 'll notice that you 're not alone as i said a lot of what happens in parenting is that big things happen out in the world and um they kind of come home to roost in the privacy of our homes and we 're left trying to figure out how to manage them and they 're when we struggle to manage them um we feel like it 's our fault and when we get to notice that everyone 's in the same boat we kind of can tell that while there are things we need to fix and things we probably need to do better um it 's really not your fault and you 're not the only one it 's not some failing of yours the other thing is that listening to other parents you 'll learn from people 's experience you have to kind of resist the temptation to ask sort of inquisitive questions that really aren 't about listening i remember at that stage of parenting at 16 i 'm not with a daughter who 's that stage of parenting when it was really important um to know where the best parks were i remember someone talking about um their uh their park the park that they 'd found and i um oh i 've just lost things here here we are sorry i um had to do it was everything they were talking about this in a in a listening partnership and it was everything i could do uh not to ask them where the park was but we don 't do that in my listening partnership because that would be about me not about them so that 's us i would love for you to um find a listening partnership it will you 'll find it makes a really big difference i want to talk a little bit about your children [Music] to learn well children really need to feel safe and wanted and the school environment is big and complex and often they won 't feel safe and wanted so our job is to kind of is to help with that as i said we can kind of spend a lot of time have control over is how you are with your child so children need lots of physical closeness and connection and uh if you 'd like to know more about this i i can recommend um we teach a tool called play listening which i won 't get to talk about today which is where children get to where we play with our children where they 're in charge and they get to laugh a lot laughter 's incredibly powerful way to offload lighter fears and there 's a great book by a guy called larry cohen called playful parenting which explains um how you can use play to offer your children physical closeness and connection uh in a way that 's really powerful children also really need um they need to play without preset rules or a sense of competition and i 'll talk a bit more about that uh one of the things about school is that the play what play there is will probably have a lot of rules and there 's often quite a lot of competition at school that 's not easy on young people the hold out relaxed high expectations they need us to have high hopes for them but to be flexible about the struggles that our children will have in reaching for and maybe meeting those those goals most of us know about high expectations but they were tense for most of us when we were young the the expectations that were held out for us were tense we were afraid that if we didn 't meet them we would lose our relationship with people so what we 're looking for here is relaxed high expectations so that might sound like sweetheart i know you can do this maths and then what makes high expectations work is being prepared to listen to how your children feel as you hold them out and i 'll talk a bit more about that everyone when they 're learning needs freedom to make mistakes and again somehow even in schools that try quite hard perhaps it 's because the whole system requires that children be marked all the time but there can often get to be a real big fear about trying things and making mistakes and and so we 'll need to be thinking about this when we meet them at home when they get home young ones also need a really sturdy sense of being respected and being treated fairly and a friend of mine we were talking um about how important dinner time has become in our families now we have older children and she was telling me how her son spends quite a lot of time over dinner often talking in a heated animated angry not nasty angry but you know upset way about various things that have happened of school which are to do with basically at the core the way that um he feels that he hasn 't been really respected and treated fairly and schools aren 't great for feedback loops i there aren 't that many suggestion boxes that are that a young person could safely put some some suggestions in about what needs to change or in particular how some teacher needs to do things a little better and that 's a pity but it 's what we end up having to handle when our kids get home couldn 't quite get there around this and the other thing young people need is is for their feelings to be understood and listened to and this is where we have enormous power as parents um ideally this would happen at school but school really doesn 't have a lot of time for for feelings so basically what we 're wanting to do is keep that keep that sort of meter in the middle keep the dial in the middle um in terms of our relationship bank balance and we 're working with school and in the environment of school so we want to keep the balance so it 's kind of a balance between correction and connection and between home and school and all of that works in a complex kind of way and you know we will all be coming to starting our kids at school with our own worries and um i don 't know if you have some worries you could you could um let us know and we might check in on those at at the end of school um at the end of the those worries are going to be quite different from the worries that our children have so uh research suggests that children 's cortisol levels which are a measure of stress uh consistently start to go up about six months before they start school so they 're anticipating a pretty big experience and the victorian department of education did a study that that found that these were amongst the top concerns that young people have things like where are the toilets what are the rules who 'll be my friend what adult cares about me will i get to play um missing home and missing us and uh a kind of big question around can i really manage this on my own in other words um [Music] i 've grouped these into four general categories one of them is about a need for information the other is about a very deep human need for connection the third thing is about having feelings and one of the things that we know most of us know our children are going to have is some big feelings around separation and the other is a really really important so i 'm going to talk about each of those things in turn information 's the easy one although i think it 's going to be a little harder this year um schooling from home is a whole other story and maybe i should do a little webinar on that because i have some firm views about it but generally schools are running transition to school programs i think this year those might be a little trickier so whatever you can do to help your child be familiar with the school environment if possible get to meet their teachers do some practice runs get your head around the logistics where the toilets are a big issue is what to pack for lunch i thought this was a bit ridiculous when i first came across it but i work um some of the time with teachers and it drives teachers nuts when little ones turn up with lunch boxes full of stuff they can 't open on their own so just keeping lunch simple and so that children can manage it just nuts and bolts stuff like how and again you 'll want to be tackling holding out relaxed high expectations and tackling some feelings around this but if you can give your child a hand with some really basic stuff like however whatever it takes to tie up their shoelaces in fact slip on shoes if possible or probably the best bet but um just how to manage themselves how to manage putting clothes on and off all of that sort of real nuts and bolts logistical stuff i think for most of us i think as adults we forget what it must be like to go into a place where you 've got no prior experience of of that of that or anything like it so there 's nothing that that a young person many young people can call on to help them navigate and anticipate and get through this completely new experience you know most of us as adults we just wouldn 't have that experience anymore there 'd be something we could call on from our experience that will help with this new challenge kids don 't have that so all these little bits 's really important to young people is a sense of connection so children love to learn i mean we almost can 't stop them learning and they need connection like they need air food and drink when they feel connected they can use their thinking brain [Music] connection is profoundly important martin seligman who 's a psychologist who 's sort of pioneered the field of positive psychology he 's he and his colleagues have done a whole lot of research about what makes people happy and people report that that that it 's not really that they 're in better shape or that they have more money or that they are more religious than the rest of us or that they 're better looking the thing that really makes the difference is whether or not people how social people are and people who are extremely social and have you know good uh regular regularly sort of used social networks are much happier it 's fundamental and um i recently well earlier this year i had i had was reminded of how important actual sort of face-to-face connection is i was i thought i 'd be able to do it via tele health but my um i was at the medical center and they didn 't the doctor didn 't know who i was so they wanted me to turn up i guess to make sure i wasn 't sort of pretending and so i had to go up to the medical center and in the middle of the lockdown um just that connection with this young man who i 've never seen before and i may never see it again and i probably spent 10 minutes with him but i came out feeling so much better and i think it was just being with another human being um yeah in a social connection with another human being and children can think better when they 're connected so i remember taking my daughter back to school back to swimming lessons after the long summer break when she was younger and she 's a really confident competent swimmer so i was a bit surprised when she balked at getting in the pool and really didn 't want to do it and it going to tell here but the thing that made the difference to get her into the pool was that a teacher um connected with her very deliberately and personally she gave her a 10 minute one-on-one listen and within 10 minutes she had her in the pool with the other kids swimming up and down and i think it was that just that extra little bit of connection that made the difference to getting over the hurdle of braving the pool again after the summer break and myself i remember um you know around learning i remember helping in the classroom when my daughter was little and the teacher said to me could you just give this little one a hand she doesn 't want to do the work so i went over and i sat with her and she actually had a little cry which i understood was about getting rid of some feelings that were getting in the way so i was happy to listen to them and she didn 't have to have too much of a cry before she kind of popped out as children do having fun learning this thing and what was interesting was which i 'll talk about later but what the kids were doing was they were they were going through the materials that the teacher had given them but they were um pretending to be the teacher and they were using a whiteboard and they were putting things up on the whiteboard and handing out assignments and doing lots of ticks and crosses so what they were doing was um learning something from the position of being powerful and that 's that 's what young people will do they were turning themselves into the teacher handing out things i thought it was so interesting so it was the connection with me the chance to have a few feelings and then the playfulness of the way that her her classmates were approaching the problem that well that meant that this girl could engage the teacher told me there was some big drama going on at home so she was carrying a pretty heavy backpack into school but those three things you know connecting listening to her feelings and playfulness were what made happening in the classroom so when children feel connected they can use their thinking brain when they go off track when they 're looking like they 're doing things that don 't make sense generally it 's a sign that they 're not feeling connected and that 's what we need to focus on and i just want to talk a little bit um about play uh oh feelings sorry so i 've talked a little about feelings stressful experiences create emotional tension and that emotional tension um doesn 't go away on its own often what happens is it sits there and feelings migrate and they snowball so a child 's inability to do their maths homework may turn into an inability to do their english homework or uh a good example i have of um is a a friend of my daughters came to play and she 's really really scared of the cat and we had to spend all this time figuring out what to do about the cat so that they could have a play date without it being completely consumed by where the cat was game or something with her dad this little girl 's dad and he said oh look we 've got to the point where she was really scared of cats and dogs he said we can 't go out and eat lunch outdoors at a restaurant or cafe because my daughter 's become really scared of birds and i thought that 's a perfect example of how fears snowball every time they come up a child 's brain is overwhelmed by the feeling and all sorts of other things get stuck to it so they migrate and they snowball and feelings drive off track behaviour so when we feel like we need to bring a limit it usually means our kids are off track and actually it means that feelings are driving the show [Music] i think it 's also important to understand that there 's a bigger picture around feelings so it 's pretty tough being little in a big people 's world and i think also at the moment we 're all kind of anxious in a low level if not a high level way about the pandemic and about work just there 's a lot more pressures on everybody and our young ones are picking that up and one of the things that happens with young people and their feelings is that they tend to have big feelings about little things so i think every parent has an experience of a child getting really upset about something that just seemed completely ridiculous and generally actually that 's not a ridiculous process it 's that a child is looking to get a hand with some big bunch of feelings some some big feeling that 's often too big for them to even talk about or articulate but they hang it on some little thing um some i know something comes to mind a friend of mine they were moving house or they were planning to move house and their daughter really didn 't want to move and in the process they decided to get rid of their old television and at that point the television was um was deeper than it was wide it was it was an old television and nobody would have had feelings about it leaving cry about missing the television about the television having to go and my friend said look i think that what it was about was actually about moving house but that 's where she could bring it up that 's the thing about which she could have some feelings about this big change in her life so we need to take seriously all those little upsets they 're actually important and stopping showing feelings doesn 't actually make them go away they fester often and become what we call emotional backpacks i will talk a little bit about separation um you can find much more information on my website about separation and um canterbury council we did a webinar on separation a few months ago so if you find your way to the youtube canopy council youtube you 'll probably find that video um but the project of separating from us is what i would call an emotional project it 's one that that extends over a long time it goes in phases it will be fine for a period and then it will crop up again and it usually takes and early early separations for young people um often create emotional tension which doesn 't dissolve without help and if your child if you know that your child is going to have big feelings about leaving you now we 're in the southern hemisphere here and we 're moving towards children starting school in six months even if you can 't do the whole transition to school thing um what what what will be really worth doing is is is organizing a project around separations so you 've got six months to work on it um i recommend making a plan for it and getting some help with it i i really love helping parents around separation it 's it 's so hard when it 's a big issue in your relationship with your child it makes leaving and being away for short times really stressful for you both and it 's something that that you really can make lots of progress on and you you 've got the time if you start now to do that so that that there 'll be a bunch of feelings probably that your you won 't be able to kind of deal with any other place and won 't come up any other way than faced with leaving you on their first day of school but there 'll be a lot of feelings about separation that you can do really good work with your kids around up until up until that point i recommend hand-in-hand parenting have produced a number of really really good value excellent short video courses and you 'll probably find say goodbye to separation anxiety um is worth having a look at they 're quite reasonably priced um and that they 're really packed with useful information and things you can do how you can kind of set up a project and feel free to have a chat with me if that 's an issue so play is the other thing that young ones really need a lot of so the american academy of pediatricians has said that play or some available free time in the case of older children and adolescents is essential to the cognitive physical social and emotional wellbeing of children and youth it 's very language of children it 's how they learn it 's how they make sense of the world um it 's how they make friends and i remember when my daughter started school i really had um i was surprised at how long it seemed to take to kind of make friends because she had solid solid friends from preschool but it was a play-based preschool and i think those kids had such a deeply deeply formed play relationship that you could have moved it to the middle of the simpson desert and they would have been fine but at school given that that it 's preoccupied with other things and there 's not nearly enough time for play kids really um struggled to connect with each other in as fast as they could so um play is really important and it 's so important that um the united nations convention on the rights of the child describes it as a human right they they say that adults support a free play brings the most benefits for young people any kind of play is good but free play which is play that 's a human right that 's you know pretty extraordinary so um one of the things about school most school environments is children are not getting to initiate control and organize the play they 'll find ways to do it like those little girls in the classroom it 's like they knew that to learn this they needed to play with it and they needed to be in control and direct how the learning was going to go so children will find ways of doing it but if you can help them with that it 's hugely beneficial so i want to talk about some of the listening tools um that we teach in hand in hand those will help you with preparing for school and what what we want to focus on is packing [Music] the bag your child 's emotional backpack in the morning with connection vitamins they 'll be a good nutritious lunch but what they need is connection vitamins and when they come home you 'll need to reconnect after the period of separation and you 'll need to unpack the emotional waste that they two things the whole experience of starting school will be way easier for both of you so how do you connect and most of us have close times in our family times where we notice that we are close where we enjoy each other 's company every family has rituals of connection when i when when we 're in a group and i can hear from you um one of the things that uh people often talk about is reading to their children you know at bedtime but everybody has times where the they they 're close at the moment for us mealtime is really important and actually the research suggests that one of the sort of super protective factors for adolescents um for adverse against adverse outcomes is actually meal times getting to have a meal with the family um i wouldn 't get too preoccupied with that with younger children i spent a lot of time working with parents who are struggling to get their kids to come to the table and young ones really aren 't that interested in that kind of more formal experience but older probably have ways that you connect with your with your kids but i want to talk about um a particular kind of play time that 's incredibly efficient for building connections so if you just have 10 or 15 or 20 minutes this is the best way you could spend it with your kids it 's a very very effective way of packing those connection vitamins in and reconnecting at the end of the day so every child um has a really high need to have a one on sort of a direct line in to each of the people who care for for them so ideally a child would do some special time with whoever cares for them their mum their dad the child carer grandma ideally grandmas well actually grandmas sometimes have a real instinct for special time i think because they 're not burdened with all of the work of parenting there 's actually a little bit more slack there sometimes um so it 's one child and generally one adult you can actually have more than one adult mum and dad can do special time with child it 's going to be a challenge to figure out a time but it 's really worth it each child really needs to know that they can show you whatever they need to show you and special time makes that space you set a time so there 's a timer on this is because in special time we say to young people i 'll do whatever you want and we really have to bring our best efforts to that but sometimes our kids want to do stuff that we really find incredibly boring or we really don 't want to do and that 's why there 's a timer the timer is for both your child and for you um it means a child knows just how long they 've got you and you know if we were in a conversation and you were trying to talk to me about something important and i kept looking at my phone and it was pretty clear that any minute i would disappear you wouldn 't really feel safe to talk to me about what was really of concern to you special you they 'll show you what they 're interested in they 'll show you what you 're what they 're worried about in the kind of play that they choose and they need to know that you 're going to hang in there for the whole time so you announce it you say let 's do special time honey let 's do whatever you want you offer extra warmth extra eye contact and if laughter happens it 's good laughter is how young people um well everybody actually offloads lighter fears and being little is quite scary there 's a lot of laughter that needs to be had there 's a reason that young people set up laughter fests you know where they seem to be joking about things that is completely stupid and it 's because they have an instinct for offloading emotional tension and laughter is a fantastic way to do that it 's a time special time is a time when a child is in charge of the play so any way that you can be less competent sillier less in charge that will often bring laughter as grown-ups and helps to set the play up so that the child is in charge special time is this place where a child gets a break from being the littlest the smallest the least knowledgeable that 's what your agenda needs to be so you know if a child decides to do drawing in special time and bumps into some feelings about it um i 'm i 'm a terrible drawer i 've had this happen and it 's like then you need to draw even worse than them so they can get to be the competent one or if a child wants to play i was doing special time with the daughter of a friend of mine regularly for a while and she really wanted to play board games and when you 're playing board games in special time it can be a bit tricky because some board games whether you win or lose is kind of a game of chance really but basically to the extent that you can you want to lose this is where they get to win or they get to cheat and you it 's an experience where they get to have us as an experience of success um and and and ideally it works best if that success is because they 've outwitted you so being silly and putting them in charge is really important and as part of that you really don 't want to give advice or instruction you have plenty of opportunities in your relationship with your child to offer advice [Music] it doesn 't always get taken all that well but you have plenty of spaces where you can give instruction and offer advice and special time is not one of them so why does special time work it works because a child can tell that you 're really on their side that they have it it boosts their deep sense of connected with connection with you sense of being connected to you which helps them learn and that 's a sense of connection that they can carry with them through the day through you know a harder less connected learning experience at school it works because they get to show you and the way that children play have a vivid memory when my daughter started school of um of as soon as she started school she wanted to play teacher games where we were all the teacher we were all the students the grown-ups were the students and she was being the teacher and telling us what to do but i have this really clear memory about um uh playing uh she set up this game in special time that where there were these hula hoops and we had to jump through these hula hoops in exactly a certain way and and i mean i just thought that 's interesting but we had watched when we first went to school i remember standing at the school fence watching school sports which are very highly organized and regimented and i remember thinking this must look strange to her because she 'd come from a play-based preschool where they just had free play and what do you know straight up in special time that 's what she wanted to play and i knew where it was coming from basically any kind of play that a child chooses in special mundane and ordinary sometimes special time is just about reassuring um themselves of your connection with them but um sometimes it 's it 's playing out an experience that has been hard for them and they do it uh by by playing the powerful role so a child who 's had a lot of medical interventions will often choose to play doctors in special time and it 's it 's a pretty handy thing to have um to have a doctor 's kit around they 'll be wanting to give you injections and do things to you and it 's part of them working through that traumatic experience but from the position of being powerful so special time empowers children it it builds their emotional awareness what happens is when they start to feel a bit disconnected and tempted to go off track what they 'll do is ask you for special time you don 't have to give it whenever they ask but it tells you that they 're low on connection and you may be able to do some little thing if not five minutes of special time over that hump my daughter would often ask for special time right when i was trying to cook dinner because i guess she felt less connected when i was preoccupied with getting dinner ready so i 'd give her a bit of a rumble and the other thing about special time is we really feel better about our parenting it 's like we um you know i was a bit surprised when i became a parent how i expected to have all this time looking googly eyes into my beautiful child and you know having loving times and actually an enormous amount of time was spent just dealing with um just dealing with the sort of practicalities of life and we really want to be close to our kids so putting your head on the pillow at night knowing that you really listened to your child you made space for them to show you what was was going on for them and you were paid attention and were able to be warm and close with them you 'll feel better about your parenting so that 's special time and then so you can do special time 10 minutes in the morning we 'll make everything go easier and then when they get home in the afternoon even a short special time five or ten minutes will ease the way into uh the rest of the afternoon so reconnects you but the other thing that you 'll want to have a handle on is how to unpack the backpack of feelings that come home from school so feelings are released in a very physical way tears contain stress hormones and they release grief tantrums are actually a good thing um they release frustration they 're how human beings release frustration and i don 't think that being too is necessarily terrible but i think developmentally what happens at that age is that children are big enough to be trying a whole bunch of things they don 't really know how to do and haven 't mastered yet and that 's very frustrating for them so two-year-olds will often have a lot of tantrums um [Music] even 16 year olds have tantrums they look a little different um actually even grown-ups have handle actually um and to get through and and have as a productive experience with young young ones and laughter actually heals fears and getting a chance to cry when you need to laugh when you need to and have a tantrum when you need to really does restore a person 's capacity to think getting feelings out of the way allows thinking to happen and makes it possible for young people to learn and cooperate so what you want to do is help your child unpack their backpack when they 've got upsets by using the listening tool called we call stay listening so you want to make things safe so if they 've hit their sister we need to get in there between the two of them if they 're harassing the cat um well i can ask the cat harasses the child but anyway if they 're harassing the cat um then you need to make things safe or if there 's anything that they could break you need to get it out of the way what you want to do is move close and pour in our children are are upset i think that 's because of a couple of things um but one of them is that most people were not warm with us when we were upset that showing our feelings in a volatile kind of way often had adults moving away from us instead of towards us and what we want to do when a child 's upset is move towards them where they can pour out their feelings and we just listen we don 't have to fix the problem um there probably will be some problems that need fixing but the older your child gets the the less chance there is that you 're going to be able to fix them in my experience and listening goes a long long way so my friend and her dinner time with her adolescent boy i think her boy who 's telling a lot of stories about all these unfairnesses at school really there 's not much we can do about that sometimes there 's something really egregious or really serious that we need to go in and talk to the school about but stopping the feelings doesn 't actually stopping the crying or stopping the tantrum or stopping the laughter doesn 't actually stop the feeling it just sends it underground so it 's a useful thing to let a child cry generally when they 're upset we don 't want to be having trying to reason with them because actually when they 're upset their thinking mind is offline so a good rule when your child 's upset is five words or less once you start trying to say more than five words what you 're probably looking for is your child 's thinking mind which is out the window at the moment when they 're upset so you just want to listen to how they 're feeling and not jump in to fix it so um just to sort of summarize um what we 're wanting to do around starting school is keep the balance to focus on what we actually have control over so we want to build connection and and pack the backpack with special time we want to provide opportunities for play where a child gets to be want to be listening to feelings and unpacking the backpack which is where we can just stay listen use five words or less get close i know sweetheart i know it 's hard and i think what 's also important is that we get support for ourselves um that we have listening partnerships where we can um talk about how the whole thing 's making us feel so um if you have questions um i don 't know if we 've got a little bit of time anita um if anybody 's got any questions um if they 've sent any questions through to you yes um they have oh great um so let 's see what people were asking there was a question from putri maliha um around her and it 's in the chat around her younger child hitting and she 's not quite sure what to do with that kind of emotion um when her younger younger child is hitting his sister okay she 's not understanding why he 's hitting her yeah that 's probably um a whole other webinar but basically when a child is a an emotional backpack full of fear and um they any sibling rivalries are complicated and sibling relationships are can be complicated but often tightness between children and between siblings is connected to how close and connected they feel to their to their parents so a first place to start um with a child who 's hitting and with sibling rivalries and difficulties is figuring out how to get some special time in with each of your children where the other child is not around so they have a one-way line into you that they don 't have to share when children 's cup of connection is full enough they tend not to have quite so much difficulty with each other i think when things are feeling tight and they don 't feel well connected they point it at each other and you need to address that first around hitting we need it 's it 's [Music] it 's useful to understand that it 's fear you need to stop anybody getting hurt and that 's a limit setting exercise and if you find your way to my website um 's a um a heading which is common parenting topics and um limit setting is there so whenever we have to stop a child um because they 're off track and and hitting would be off track we 're effectively setting a limit so you need to get in there and keep everybody safe and then you need to say to him sweetheart i 'm i 'm not going to let you hit your sister ideally we want to get there before the hit lands because then we 've only got one child to deal with which is the childhood 's hitting once the thump lands we 've got two children we 've got the child who 's hitting who 's struggling with fear and we 've got um another child who 's been hurt it 's more complicated so if a child is hitting we want to get in and stop it before the punch lands and interrupt it and then what happens is he will get really upset if you move in warmly at that point and that upset is part of the process the upset is the which is driving his off-track behavior but if you want a hand uh one of the short courses that hand in hand offers um is called helping children with aggression and you 'll find a whole lot explained there about why kids are aggressive and and what to do about it um in this context it 's something that 's a big worry for many parents if their child 's inclined to be a hitter what 's going to happen to them when they get into the school environment and it 's a real concern because it 's a tricky thing for teachers to handle so if you can give your child a hand with that before school starts it will make a big difference thank you madeline yeah if you want to know more um come and chat with me beautiful and um yeah rana 's got a question um she 's asking uh if schools would allow a special toy to come in because he he brings a special toy to preschool yeah but will a school allow a special toy i think you can ask and some _''_4332.0 you can do is ask you sort of have to have respect for their experience in managing this transition and if they say no it will be because there 'll be some things you need to have a fight with the school over um and and i certainly think in becoming a school parent you should never feel afraid to go and have a chat with teachers i 've always felt like i was wasting people 's time before i 've gone in but i 've never once felt that going and having a talk with a teacher about something wasn 't helpful so you need to put your child what you you know your child best and you need to help teachers sometimes understand about your child but on the other hand they 're managing you know 15 20 25 other kids and they 'll be things they can 't manage and one of the things they may not be able to manage is a special toy one of the things about special toys if your child has a special toy i actually think you have an opportunity to and that actually is about helping your child feel feelings about separation it 's actually a very useful thing to do because one of the problems with a special toy at school is that if another child gets it or if your child loses track of it they will get very upset and schools haven 't really got the slack to handle that so i 'd have a chat with them some schools will have rituals i know at the preschool that my daughter went to they they had fat little booklets of family photos and often on if a child was upset about their parent leaving because there isn 't slack for teachers to be listening to six or seven kids have a big cry at once about their parent leaving they 'll have strategies for helping your children manage their feelings it doesn 't mean that the feelings have gone away but children do get pretty good at managing them in the school environment and that 's a good thing but you need to give them space to feel those feelings at home that 's great madeleine thank introverted child um doesn 't really feel comfortable with others that is more than one person or an adult yeah that 's fear um like there 's a number of big categories of feeling that we struggle with and you can get all complicated about trying to figure out what those feelings are and fundamentally in my experience the sort of grief fear embarrassment is a version of fear grief and fear fatigue is probably another one um tiredness um so that that 's fear and that 's where a relaxed high expectation it 's it 's um effectively any time where you you see that your child needs to move on something that they don 't want to move on that 's really effectively a limit setting exercise so holding out for your child that they can go and join some other children in play is effectively setting a limit for them it 's not the way we understand we were brought up with limits like you 've got to go and do that or else but it 's saying well there 's this thing you could do that to hold out that you can do it it 's where a relaxed high expectation is really useful so being on a playground with other kids and you stay by your child 's side but you hold out that they could go and join in the play hi sweetheart i reckon you could go over there and say hello to that little girl you don 't expect that she 'll be able to do it your child but what you 're after is is heading her in a direction that will help her have her fears release her fears about being close to other kids it 's a bit of a project and you know you 'd be most welcome to to organize to have a chat with me about how you might tackle it um but generally she 'll need to be prodded towards being with other kids but you 're doing that so not so that she learns how to do it because a child 's natural instinct is to connect with other children you 're doing it so that you you can bring her feelings to the to you and not want to go and and whale about not wanting to play with these other children what will happen over time is that um she 'll get through some of those feelings and she 'll be able to connect with her natural braveness better the other thing that that makes a huge difference to children who are lacking in confidence is special time um they will sort of blossom um in the face of your loving warm attention for them and for what they want to do so that 's a good place to start is is doing plenty of special time special time is a very flexible tool so sometimes you 'll need to do a lot of it because things are tight and any transition in your family life special time you 'll you 'll probably want to up special time to kind of help to grease the wheels and then other times everything 's smooth and you can drop it back a bit but if a child 's a bit fearful of playing with other kids good solid special time that 's timed where with special time is that at the end of it your child will actually try to negotiate for longer and if you say no they 'll get upset and that upset is important that upset is a bunch of feelings that have been hanging around that you get to listen to your child about and they 'll get through those feelings that way um so special time with you will boost a child 's confidence and then you can hold out that they could go and play with some other child and be ready to listen to them tell you just how much they don 't want to do it and and you can just hold the limit sweetheart i know you can i know you can go and play i know you really know you really it 'll be fun you can do that you don 't push them you just hold it out and you listen for their upset that upset is about her offloading all of her fears and getting rid of and that will make you know braving the social environment of school much easier thanks have is a worry about bullies at school and uh should we send our children to learn some sports to empower themselves and those um maybe i 'll let you tackle with that one first before i 've got another two from the same person so okay all right um again a good strong solid sense of connection with you which special time is fantastic for building will help um your child through difficult social experiences at school i think if you suspect bling that 's one of the instances where it 's really important to go and talk to the school most schools have no have strategies for handling it some of them are better than others but it 's often they won 't necessarily know that it 's happening and they need information from you to know that it 's happening they they definitely don 't want to be having it happen so they will uh do stuff and they often know a lot about how to intervene around bullying and wait for you know informed by really deep experiences it 's one of the things that you children and we need to inform schools about about our children but schools have experience of many children they 've been through this many times before and often um schools can be of great help in navigating if there 's some difficulty that has got in helping you sort of figure out what to do about that um you know good good physical good confidence physically is important but the most important thing i think is that children are not carrying a whole bunch of fears which make it hard for them to ask for help when they 're in trouble and that 's an emotional project rather than a fitness exercise um so listening to your child when they bump into upsets and filling up their connection cups so that they feel confident and connected enough to ask for help will be the things that probably make the most difference around bullying great that 's fantastic madeleine next thing we have is sometimes children can be quite fickle one day a child plays with your daughter or son and the next day that same child doesn 't want to children yeah i i i have i think that helping our children navigate their uh social relationships certainly for me has been one of the hardest things and i so want to jump in and do something to help and i think probably that 's because that 's what my parents did and what i 've learned is that listening is incredibly powerful here so listening i mean well one of the things i didn 't say about entering school a very useful thing to do is to a very important thing to do is to have the space and time to build relationships with um [Music] with other families and organize play dates so when your kids are younger you have i can 't_''_5000.48 do it so easily now it 's much harder but when your kids are younger you have a lot of control over their social connections and you can back those up so so you can organize play dates and opportunities to get together with other school families and children find that very reassuring one parent i know got in touch with the school and ended school picnic a couple of picnics over the summer to which the families of um kids starting school the next year were invited so just that chance for kids to meet meet each other and fam you to meet other parents is going to make a really big difference but in terms of the fickleness of um children 's social interactions i i honestly don 't know that there 's all that much you can when there are real dangers in wading in and imposing your adult sort of agenda on their social challenges what you can do is listen to the upset and know that just listening and not trying to move in and fix anything or make helpful suggestions but just listening will loosen up your compat your child 's flexibility in the face of that so you know if they need to be heartbroken because it feels like they 've been rejected they can get that heartbreak out of the way and then they might be able to they might be able to notice that there 's some other kid in the playground who who i remember on one particular girl who spent quite a lot of time rejecting her and i remember the parent saying that when she dropped her daughter off at school she realized several other children came up to her daughter and made um you know interacted with her and effectively invited her to play with them and she didn 't want to do that because she was preoccupied with this other girl so we we just need to listen to our children 's we really can 't_''_5132.159 force the issue we can create social opportunities more broadly i think um but where our kids are having difficulty we just need to listen to that difficulty what you 'll find with younger children in particular is when you do special time if they 're if there 's a theme they 'll set up play that um explores that theme and uh and if it 's quite would be quite likely that a child would set up some game with dolls or something in special time where one doll 's being really mean to another doll and your job is to figure out how about it the laughter will help but what your child is doing is if if say they 've been bullied and then in special time they set up this game where one doll is being mean to another doll they 're being they 're they 're in charge of that game so they 're they 're working through the experience often but they 're finding a way to do it where they 're in charge and i didn 't really understand how incredibly powerful that is it 's actually an emotional healing process so it 's a way that a child will sort of try to try to get out from under a hard feeling and work through it from a different perspective from a powerful perspective so be pleased with wherever your child might bring up games it 's why it 's really important in special time not to make suggestions for for what you can play because you need to make space for your child to bring things up and if they 're having struggles and social ones might well be one of them you might find they you can you know there 's all sorts of ways you can respond you know you might um you might defend the the doll that 's being being excluded and and begged to be included and then they get to say no you can 't come in so they get to be the one in charge playing it out um if that makes sense so don 't underestimate uh what a huge difference it can make to give your child those kinds of healing play opportunities you don 't always have to move in and fix things i think as much as you it 's important to do that in in some instances it 's really important to create opportunities where your child can work through experiences in a healing way and special time is one of those that 's great answer madeline we just do got two quick ones okay um in uh just to carry on from what you were saying about um creating some play uh events for parents to get together and families uh very difficult at the moment during the pandemic yes so no real any suggestions well i don 't know it depends where your school is at with it probably the school if the one i have much to do with is anything to go by they 're actually not doing any transition to school stuff so but they if they 're not responsible they might be open to a picnic in the park and you know the the sort of health advice that 's around is that if you are keeping well i won 't get started about whether children can spread the virus but certainly activities outside with not too many people are much safer so i think it would be worth your while to talk to the school about can we organize a picnic and you know maybe limit the numbers but if you do that outside i think probably it 's as safe an opportunity as as any but any chance you have to connect with the other families will make a difference um good answer madeline we 've got a last question um any tips for parenting a highly sensitive child with meltdowns high intensities high frequencies and emotional project on your hands with with that child um [Music] i 'd say please give me a ring please organize a short time to have a chat um [Music] it 's going to be something which going on for a long time you will probably be quite worn out with it and that 's going to be one of the issues that you need to tackle um a child who 's one thing there could be there could be a range of issues at play um but a child who 's melting down a lot and for extended periods is perhaps low on connection so whatever conversation we have about the detail what i would be saying to you is first thing get some special time happening build up this sense of you being truly on their side get some more grease in the wheels of family life and let 's see if that makes a difference but um yeah commonly when i work with parents children and yeah there could be a whole bunch of things going on but commonly it 's it 's often the case when is there anything big going on in the life of the family what was that child 's early experience like what was your experience your early experience of parenting like what was the pregnancy like what was the birth like you 'd be amazed how often people told me often it 's the birth was was long and hard and difficult that can leave a child with a really big sense of fear and that that plays out in they 'll pick lots of little opportunities to have very big upsets about it so you could just have a child who 's got a really really really full emotional backpack um but there could be a whole bunch of things going on so i think if that 's what 's happening get some help great answer thank you madeline my pleasure we 've got a comment from kate saying easy peeling lunchbox special times doll play role role plays uh connect with other parents with social media a lot of great strategies and tips today um madeleine it 's always a pleasure madeleine winters from hand-in-hand parenting there will be link you to resources and madeline 's got a ton of those um look out for a survey as well that i will send you out it lets me know what sort of things you like to hear in these webinars so that i can pick the topics and the presenters that can suit you so look out for those things thank you so much for sharing your time with us today i know it 's very difficult when you have families on a saturday but thank you so much and again we enjoyed the time

    "text": "[Music] remember the other week i said hard you know less than 20 i should be washing because of the stinky and all that kind of stuff so it turned out in time for my annual wash right so we had a bit of a bath raider and got ourselves a bit clean and i sort of cut back some of the facial air has been grown get a bit out of control there so i thought it 's time to like clean up the act a bit so we worked on that so you can see i 've done a bit of alterations here just doing things different we didn 't bath a lot right on this ship right you didn 't bother letting that ship because well you went most of the time anyway right ways crash aboard like you look at the ship there right there when you 're at the seas the ways are bigger than that by oils and they 're crashing over and all that kind of stuff most sailors were wet pretty much all the time they only told me you 're dry in your bunk right because your body hate when you crawl up in your clothes right your body heat would be enough to dry your clothes out so you 're always damp in some way or another right so we didn 't do much bathing and all that kind of stuff but because you know we 're on the internet and all that kind of stuff and i didn 't know if we were in smell-o-vision or anything like that so i thought best have a bit of a clean in the clothes trim back the face fur and uh you know give you a bit of respectability and that 's what i thought you know as we 're getting close to uh talk a party it 's time to be looking a bit respectable i thought i 'd be right but could be time to start really i think ah wilson you 've got the whistle just give me that i 'll start herself again all right thank you wilson and welcome my students for lesson number 20 20. oh my goodness 22 oh wow it 's impressive we the other end of that button going what am i doing here but you 're back so i 'm here to adopt some old pirate and stuff yeah well be talking about all sorts of stuff today i 'll tell you some words phrases and then we 'll talk about some misadventures and some stuff and an exciting happening that 's coming up on the 19th of september because it 's talk like a pirate day that 's true but that 's international talk like a party amazing but right now let 's talk about a few other things like some expressions again you know we 're talking about expressions well wait a minute did you forget to stand and laugh like a pirate just kick us off very good i like that all right so what we got next is the names words and things that are all there other phrases and stuff so a common raffle around the place but actually come from us pirates and ship meant to be like ourselves so first is go by the board you heard about things like go by the boards them or don 't pay any attention to anymore they 're all gone by the board right with the board right on the ship right that 's the side of the ship we used to call that the board right so things that go by the board are things you throw over the sewing so if you throw garbage and other stuff over the sword it goes by the board and you forget about it and drifts away so that 's why now it 's all about you know things you 've just forgotten about now it 's all gone by the board right that 's where expression comes from and now all at sea that 's another one well we 're all at sea it 's when you confuse you 're not sure what you should be doing all that kind of stuff well i remember the navigation we talked about navigation all that kind of stuff what 's back in the old navigation days that 's where that one comes from right remember we talked about we had all the tricks we could do with our navigation the that was worked out we used to use plot off the side of the land and had you know that uh when you were working it all out like this but when you actually got away from the land right and you could no longer see landmarks and symbols and all those sort of things you needed right that 's when you 're all at sea right because you were all at sea you couldn 't see any land no landmarks to know to get your bearings off so you had to navigate by the stars and all that kind of stuff so that meant when you were all at sea because you weren 't quite sure what you 're doing and that 's what keeps being the same sort of meaning or all that kind of stuff right next up is by and large right boy and large she was happy boy and large i mean sort of more or less and you know more or less boring and large that 's pretty much the way i expected it that kind of thing you know that 's more or a wind behind us we call that large because the sails are full they 're full of water you put as many sails as well the winds behind you you put out all your sails you can fill them right up with a wind and that kind of stuff and we call that being large the sails are large that 's large and boy you know for us maritime guys and sailors and stuff means there 's a direction so you don 't buy the wind just by and large right so basically by and large means you 're sailing with the wind behind you almost with the windy directly behind you but not quite all right so by and large means is almost so something like by and large yeah pretty much as that 's what buying larger buoyant large it 's like this that 's what you 're buying large for right well by and large right is if you 're sailing with the wind directly behind you it 's hard right we call that a dead run when you 're doing a dead run keep the wind time because if you drop off each side of the land you 'll actually have the sails that whip around either way and you believe a bit of momentum all that kind of stuff it 's actually hard to say dead on the wind behind you right so we 'd make it just to one side a bit so by and large almost on dead diddly with the ring we could actually keep the sails full of air and we don 't have that problem we don 't have to worry so much about those little tweaks of the ejection right so it 's a better way to sail you can get a good speed and you 're not going to get into any areas and it 's not quite as complicated so by and large we like to say it is the way we say a lot of that i think so that 's where boy and large come from beans pretty much you know pretty much like that all right pretty close to salem down the winds right now next up right is batting down the hatches and right so we 've got hatches all over the top of the ship right so batman actually means where do you get rough weather and stuff like that well i 'm talking about the waves remember we 've talked to cleveland that 's right the waves crashing over right across so batten down the hatches you just batten them down so all the water don 't get in really so that 's what that means so back down the hatches means prepare for bad weather so batman hatches is like get ready for things right we 're gonna get things secure that kind of stuff right next up is keel over right now that 's another simple one you talk about keel over means you know you oh i keeled over which means you fell over and that 's basically the same for the ship right remember the keel is the bottom rib of the ship right there all the way down the bottom that 's the keel right so basically if you can see the keel or if it kills over right it 's tipping over and that 's so you kilo the same thing same thing for the ship right that 's where it comes from all right and now all right that 's all the words we 're gonna travel i 'll just give you a few phrases each time so you get a bit of a hand right getting ready to talk like a party you 'll learn all these phrases and you 'll think i already know where to talk like a priority i can say keel over all the time he says i say bye at large all the time at least my mom does she said boy and large you should have your own clean way now i bet she says that all the time i 'm sure she does right so now a few people have been asking right what pirates do for fun all right what do we do for fun well we count our booty that 's a good one and remember the exchange channels we sing shanties right we do the sea shanties and all that kind of stuff right and we drink occasionally and all that kind of the deck right we don 't do sports so much i tried water polo a few times you know but the ponies kept drowning and i thought well that 's no good for them or me so we don 't do that anymore but uh we used to do games and stuff like that we have games like board games like your modern board games right but they 'd be invented each ship would have their own version of games they 'd have similar rules but other different rules and you 'd use things you had around the place chips and all the other things you had around the place to be part of the game and you work out all sorts of complicated rules yeah lots of time to make them up so each ship would have their own different little game they play with dice and all sorts of stuff so we 're big into board games you 'd be surprised but it 's true it 's true i wouldn 't worry about anything like that and the other thing we do is our art projects right so the teeth the wheels the tusks the wheels right and they 've got screaming shores right they 'd carve out pictures of beautiful pictures of boats and stuff like that on the walls right you know they 'd uh put little boats in bottles that was always a fun one you 'd make little bottles right you 'd feed it in and you had a little trick there with strings like you pulled the moss back up and there 'd be a boat sailing boat in the bottle oh that took a lot of time was very phenomenally kind of stuff i have we made artworks with rope right you have all these dire roll ropes very look creative and look good and all that kind of stuff you know and just general whittling with sticks and stuff like that cutting things and carving things and all that kind of stuff so these are all the things you did to fill out your toy when you were doing there all right now so i 'm going to tell you a few tails right a few tails before i do that us an r and another our arm put them all good job right okay you still wake up wilson that 's good to know all right so other pirates i mean far be for me to talk ill of other pirates you know i always say if you ever got something good to say you don 't say anything at all really you know or don 't even you know talk ill of somebody unless you 've walked a mile in these shoes which is another good expression because you know if he should get upset with you saying ill of him you 'd be a mile away and you 've got a new set of shoes good plan but i 'll give you a few ideas or some other pirates in that you know i 've had miss adventures myself we talked about the three-legged chickens the other week remember that right right so we 're gonna talk about three pirates and some of their disadvantages right first up is john quadge trump quench right he was a private here right he was on a ship there he was the child he was a privateer and didn 't take him long old john right to get a bit knucky with the captain and tossed him overboard right when we got to elbow and then he got himself elected as captain i oh you thought i 'm captain now that 's great you know what i 'm doing that 's good so he thought now i 'm captain he took the ship to the south atlantic right start attacking the uh the french and the spanish i started doing those ships right i don 't know because private team remember they working for the navy though he was working for the english he had arrangement with the english kid right give him percentage act like the navy attacked those ships right so he 's doing that thinking this is great and then he spies right with his spoilers he spoils himself a portuguese gold chip and he thinks haha that 'd be good and he attacked it and he took it and he 's feeling pretty good about himself but at that time the portuguese and the english were actually were actually upset at him for actually taking the portuguese ship and so and you know the other captain right he 's original captain would have known that venus when sensible privateer but he 's quite a bit arrogant thought i can do a better job you gotta be a better job if you know what 's going on right so he didn 't know so he 's taking the portuguese ship so next time he 's in an english porter i think i 'm safe here because i 'm a privateer i 'm working you guys are he says i they kept him through him in orleans and then they gave him to the portuguese for trial all right so he didn 't last long after that that was he had a john crunch right so some of these pirates you know get a little bit off with you with themselves and make mistakes right another one was ned lowe right oh ned lowe we did his flag in the flag that isn 't it low right he was the next pick pocket right became a captain right over a crew blinder right very cruel very cruel any other thing about married people right he didn 't take any married crew right no married men on his crew right he wouldn 't take him right he didn 't want to run them off with their boys and do anything like that he only wanted bachelors right that people doing his crew he got rid of all those yeah and if he captured a ship right he 'd find out he 'd get all the bachelors on one side and all the married ones over this guy 's right and he 'd give the offer the bachelor 's a chance to be on the crew and then he disposed of the married ones right toss them over the sword maroon and all sorts of nasty things to him right he was a very cruel man and he 's cruel to his crew as well as everybody else so eventually his crew got jack up him right they got sick of him they got jack of him and said like get him adrift they put him in a long boat right just let him go drift let him drift away no wars no nothing he just drifted off then he got rescued by the french right and said oh i got rescued haas hello show you all that kind of stuff he was going ah i win my window and unfortunately you 're him one of the friends recognized him as a dreaded and nasty pirate and they end up trolling him as well and he didn 't last long after that and that was yet his career hold head roll nasty dead nasty there we used to call him but it all got him up in the end he got his come up that 's the end now the last one i 'm gonna call her that wasn 't as good as he could have been right was also henry morgan right he was a privateer too and quite a successful one right he was so successful as a privateer right and did such a good job attacking things right that they made him the governor of jamaica right all right so he was ruling the whole sort of place caribbean so for the english he was looking after the whole thing you know but he kept doing a bit of pirating on his height you know all henry morgan right he was a great soldier right he was great these battles and tactics and all that kind of stuff but he was a terrible sailor right you know off the job maybe more off the job it 's been a decent sailor i 'll tell you he was a terrible sailor one time he ran his ship aground on the rocks right oh ship scuttled the whole thing sunk there ended up having to be rescued off the rocks they 're hanging under the rocks for dear life i 'm gonna be rescued very embarrassing right and another time right another time serena morgan right he let his crew drink when they 're at it say you have a couple of drinks and all that but you know what we 're drinking that they 're all drunk right they 're all drunk as lords right drunk as lords good expression love those lords they wear drink it away all is is going down into the gunpowder right and then put another gunpowder home with a light candle and he 's managed to drop it set hogged it blow up just blew up probably lit the candle with the bloody wick and also that you know god let her go just let it go blew up the whole ship they lost 250 sailors right 250 sailors he was one of the fewest of boys or any morgan he was a you know lucky blighter he 'd be lucky blighter but you know that was it you know just those simple things you got to do as a ship that 's why we 're learning all this stuff right so we don 't make these mistakes you know we don 't go into the gunpowder shed right with a lit candle when we 're drunk all right that 's just not a good plan right no it 's not and you know we talked about you know touch and go and all that sort of stuff we don 't get ourselves on the ground right but we 're not the beautiful of stuff so you don 't do anything like that all right so that 's a gives you a few titles tales of daring new and failures and all that kind of stuff now we had a couple of questions we got a few questions right about the old mate here right it 's all right somebody said to me right wilson wilson what 's the shot for what 's a short for her i said he 's short for because he 's only got little legs that makes him shorter right i thought that was pretty obvious but okay you can ask your questions and all that kind of stuff and i know some of you think he 's pretty smart he said well he 's pretty smart he was telling jokes earlier wrong and all kinds of get a bit quiet lately but you know he did all this sort of stuff so he 's a very smart bird he 's a smart bird and i said well he 's not that smart i mean we played chess most weeks right all right and i beat him three smart all right okay just so you know but you know he 's a good companion especially when he 's quiet best companion is always quite i 've always found well i haven 't found that many quiet companions but you know what i mean it sounds like a nice thing and i 'd be keen on it video that could happen but i digress what else do we got to cover now i think we 're pretty much done for the day lesson 20. it 's been so cute but you know good fun a lot of stuff but there 's one little thing i 've got to cover for you i 've got some exciting news i started hinting

wanna stop and cry everyday [Music] telling me that things are not how they should be sometimes i think this house is haunted by a memory i cannot explain that never goes away why can 't_''_122.479 i escape the past live my life again at last that would be good if only i could now that the truth is understood a ghost in the mirror keeps on looking they should be sometimes i think this house is haunted by a memory i cannot explain that this ghost never goes away [Music] i wanna fly but i got my wings got no place to go every night i see my dream [Music] this goes [Music] is [Music] now this is a song of my solo cd which i put out a couple of years ago uh it 's uh kind of about just everything seems to beep these days [Music] and uh just from the car to the stove to the elevator and it 's not not to mention the phone and um anyway so i read this song about it [Music] do whilst in the crowd [Music] forever falling uphill taking my film keeping it all together dreaming out loud [Music] just turn off the telephone all along me and the telephone [Music] gun [Music] you on the roller coaster one day i 'll find the time to fall between the lies every moment coming closer i 'm alone just me and the telephone i 'm alone [Music] can i turn up the telephone [Music] there 's something beeps everything 's cheap nothing it will last forever it all together [Music] this is a song called only love kind of about the pain that can come with love [Music] do [Music] oh [Music] you throw [Music] apart praying for the healing to start it 's only love [Music] somehow it 's the sweetest only love works you with just that one taste [Music] feels everything else is a waste [Music] so so [Music] it 's only love it 's only love it 's all in love it 's only love [Music] is now this is a song kind of um i guess about growing up and in some ways growing up in new zealand uh when i sing it i think about the black sand on the west coast [Music] [Music] [Music] a gentle rain starts to fall [Music] pretty soon tearing holes through the walls [Music] just the thought makes me shiver [Music] is [Music] for sure you gotta lean to arrive there are days i remember walking slow across the sand scooping stones to the future [Music] never knowing [Music] forever you gotta leave [Music] finally to rise to rise [Music] do [Music] this is another track of my um my solo cd i did a while ago [Music] which was a little bit like therapy i guess so a lot of these songs are very autobiographical and um this one is no exception it 's called sirens [Music] you lift the lights on you 're my kitchen [Music] did you know this what was missing [Music] on this climbing up the walls echo in the halls like cyrus i can 't imagine [Music] what you were thinking [Music] simply sinking slowly drifting fast [Music] temperature sauce stretching out its claws like cyrus this is [Music] so many times [Music] i think you know it is nothing here at all [Music] just sorry [Music] just i cyrus just sirens this is a fairly recent song [Music] i was going to call it missile town about some of the famous deserted towns in america but it ended up just being called going down i 'm going down i 'm going down [Music] so long i wonder how long ago what makes this life burning pain where is like a rusty night [Music] i 'm going down [Music] so long so long i wonder how low i 'll go [Music] this one 's a kind of a bluesy one just got to move something excuse me and i 've got to fix that lead as well [Music] [Music] so [Music] do right in this town is not the way to do it but if i saw your eyes i might not go through [Music] so i pretend we are just friends and now we 're right this is the end baby i 've been long gone [Music] i 'll be far away and nothing you can say will change that you probably are why i had to do it [Music] things maybe tomorrow i 'll go so i can only in the shadows of the night i know what i believe [Music] i 'll be far away and nothing you can say will change that [Music] baby why did it have to go wrong maybe i 'll end up on some devil 's [Music] highway [Music] i left behind me [Music] maybe behind me baby just check the to be called [Music] broken down that 's all right [Music] broken their car on the side of the road never gonna take another loan broken down house on the end of the street [Music] broken bars what we would mean seem like everything is broken down in this old town [Music] broken down in my mind another place another time [Music] broken and smile i knew so well [Music] is broken down in this old town [Music] do [Music] so broken and calm on the side of the road never gonna take another loan [Music] broken down house on the industry broken boys when we would meet [Music] seem like everything is broken down [Music] is broken down in this old town [Music] now this is a song called fox gloves and daisy chains this one 's also off my cd [Music] do [Music] so [Music] see [Music] sure all those precious and defenses build [Music] you [Applause] [Music] this as we walk past it 's true it 's true [Music] better when the truth goes [Music] both the same for someone searching for someone and when the sun those days of summer when the grass grew high searching for each other like the trees reached for the sky fast gloves and days [Music] change fast [Music] daisy chains daisy dreams last class [Music] ah this one this song is uh called peace i think in all ways most of us are looking for that i put my water over there that 's right so [Music] do [Music] i 've been living in a lonely place [Music] filled my life with empty space [Music] putting on my human face god inside [Music] every day there 's only gloom wall to wall in every room i just want peace and it 's out of reach and this life is killing me [Music] [Music] just a lone and cheating death olive branching every breath [Music] lost [Music] lift me up from my despair [Music] i just want peace but it 's out of reach and this life is killing me

    "text": "[Music] others there are shipments how you be covered treat your friendly i hope you 're enjoying your lockdowns of getting involved and doing things and learning new skills like we 're gonna do today when we learn more pirate skills in lesson number 19 only 19 some people say other people say 19 that 's way too many what are you still doing on our computers but enough of that i think we just ignore them and blast straight through because that 's what we pirates do we just storm things what do we do we go ah that 's right oh look at it now we didn 't even have to put them together they just came together for themselves did you notice that we 're getting so advanced we know that our from our elbow good job right what are we covering today oh lots of things lots of little things and all that sort of stuff some things we said we cover in other things well we 'll do whatever but what i want to talk to you about to start off with right there 's sayings and things that we know these days but you don 't realize they come from pirates isn 't that right mr wilson all right there he is mr wilson 's with me as well it 's good to see you back in fight and vettel although he 's a little queer at the moment because uh i 've taken his tongue and put it off somewhere else just to keep things between you and me right otherwise he keeps interrupting all the time all right now first word right foot loose you heard of that name footloose footloose and fancy free ah i hear that was either one of them celluloidy things called footloose what does it mean it 's a naval thing again that 's us the pirates footloose right you see this is the mainsail we talked about that before right the bottom of the main sail is called the foot sensible enough and so when it hasn 't been secured it 's loose foot loose and it flaps around all over the place right that 's what it means about putting it all over the shop to anything right you 're off fancy free that 's where it comes from the footnotes right that now another one right another one you 've heard about being over a barrel right you heard about being over a barrel a little over a barrel of being a bad thing right well being a barrel right we talked about the cat anointed remember the cat annoying deals right when the cat out of the bed and all that kind of stuff right well they used to lash you up to give you a whip so you 're all still right so they need to do it to the mars right the master the ship there right there or they tie you over the gun i think i mentioned that before about you know kissing the gunner 's daughter they used to call that they told you with a gun or they taught you a barrel right and so having you over a barrel was a bad thing where 'd that come from what about shake a leg heard about shake leg means hurry up and get going all that kind used to sleep in amex right we 'd be in annex so you 'd be lying there in hammocks and all that kind of stuff so you 'd have the whole crew with your lawyer in their amex waiting to come out or the the shift of the crew that was sleeping another time right and if they weren 't getting out there they 'd let them shake leg or shoulder leg right that 's what they say what that meant they want to see your leg coming up off out of the humming helmet because you know when i have it you sort of sink into it right they want to see that leg coming out and you get moving right so that 's where that comes from shake leg goes about getting out of your hiking i see interesting stuff like that what about touch and go you heard about touch and go right oh that things are a bit touch and go you 're not sure if it 's going to work out or not right ah again as us you 're going into a like a and it 's a bit shallow and you 're not so sure if you 're going to do that remember the boats this is just the top actually well there 's no load in this one because normally the sail down there right so you 've sailed along right underneath it 's all underneath the water there and underneath you 're not sure how deep it is right sometimes things will be touch and go you might scrape across the bottom and then keep going that 's touch and go so you 'd be happy to do it and that 's where it comes from but things are a bit touch-and-go you 're not sure if you 're gonna get ground on the ground or not right so that 's where that one comes from and the last one i 'm going to cover right is slush fund you heard that slush fund it 's like a bit of money you keep a selling and stuff like that well that again comes from the slavers right the cooks in fact right because we know we talked about the bully beef it was all salted beets right so we draw it out and all that kind of stuff so they boil that off right and as they pulled it off they get fatty slush on the top because of fatty bits of what 's not you know makes it rot faster and lots of stuff so they boil all that off right so build it off and then all the greasy stuff would all sit on the top and they 'd scrape that off right they 'd scape all that off and they could keep that and when you got to a port you 'd actually sell it to somebody to make candles out of it right and the money you got from that was called the slush fund and that could be used for buying other things other food products you know with points we 'd share it around but other other ships that he would cook should just have a bee 's little bonus and all that kind of stuff but for us but that 's where slush fund comes from see interesting stuff all this stuff it comes pirates and our soil is right on those old days okay now i think i 've touched on this a bit before but i want to talk about all those other names that are off the pirates all right all the names that you label pirates with you know over with the time and all that kind of stuff you know i think i 'll talk about that now unless you want to yell out right now and tell me to stop you ready i couldn 't hear you all right maybe you need to clear your throats what about you give me a r didn 't hear anything okay so what are we talking about ah that 's right the different types of pirates that 's right i remember now oh so we 'll start with the bucket here all right the buccaneer if you took my cooking one you would have seen that one one of my cooking ones talking about the bucket ears because basically buccaneers with barbecues right these are caribbean pirates right they lived on the islands right and what they used to do is used to eat them right they cook them with big barbecues it was a french barbecue called a bouquet and so it was like buccaneer come from that right that just means barbecues right so they 're really australians are pirates because they 're all about the barbecue all right and now corsair are that 'd be another french word the corsair that means chasers right and that was what they call the pirates mostly around the mediterranean you know because we chasing things down and all that kind of stuff so the corsairs are from the mediterranean there like that now privateer i think we touched on that a bit before too the privateer right because the kings and queens there didn 't have huge navies all the time right the cities are a big place and they wanted a bit of help and so they 'd come to arrangements right with a cat so you come arrangement with a king right so if you 're in english you might have arranged with the english king that you wouldn 't attack any of the english ships right but you all that kind of stuff and you you pay a bit of uh you know your booty off to the king and stuff like that but it meant you had a ports you 'd use english ports and you 'd be protected a bit by the english lord so that was a privateer so they were also like pirates but with permission that was a kind of idea of a privateer right and who else we got the barbie pirates oh they 're interesting the barbary pirates right they are actually from around north africa right these kind of pirates and they operate around there interesting you know thing about them which is a bit of a turn of events right is when they captured english ships these barbary pirates right they used to sell the english sailors to slavery which is a better flip things on its head a bit there like that so you know if they were okay and they could get money for them they 'd sell them off for slavery if they weren 't they would just you know get rid of those other ways one that 'd be basically a polite way of talking to a pirate oh you 're a sea rover so if you 'd captured their ship and you 're going to die oh dear sea rover here take this little money here and go leave us alone that kind of thing they would do that right and so sea rover was like the polite way of doing it so usually when they were trying to you know get away with not you know losing their ship and all that kind of stuff they talked politely to you and call you i all right another one right it 's called a maruta right a marooner that 'd be a spanish word right for a runaway it means means run away right because that 's what they used to call the ones who 'll be the slaves right or the who 'd run away or the actual last semester who just got sick of being treated so poorly they used to treat your normal semen pretty badly and those bad ships right and so some of them would run away and they take them down like that some of their own things like that and interesting enough that became the name for maroon when they leave you on an island because you know if they caught them they 'd catch them and they 'd just leave them on an oil and somewhere and maroon became the name for it from that you know the runaways that 's what they did with their runaways and that 's how that all come about and now i would ah free booter is another one free booter right and that be an actual dutch one a free booter right and a free builder is somebody who goes around freely stealing booty right was basically the dutch thing like that so that 's how you call them free motors right and another dutch word right dutch word for pirate is actually philly buster all right philly buster is actually the dutch word for pirate now that might ring a bell people go filibuster i 've heard of that whatever i heard that that became into politics right because these people in the senate and america started it that was going on and they would just interrupt it because they wanted to vote on and they would just take over things like hijack the debate and they keep talking and talking and talking to talking and they call it a filibuster which was actually the dutch word for pirates there you go so it was like that 's all about hijacking you know you could almost say philly busted is what i 've been doing just standing up here going over and on and on taking over your valuable airtime here but that 'd be a pirating so why wouldn 't i do that because it 's just another name for pirate nah right now i think that 's all the ones i was going to cover that for that now i think i 'm going to talk about some of the animals right i was going to talk about some of the animals that 's why the older he 's here the old friend here wilson the parrot right just to talk a bit more about the animals we have on board you know we talked about nip you on the back side we do the wrong thing and all that kind of stuff right one of the animals that we have a lot of on the ship right including weevils they used to have a lot of weevils and the biscuits and stuff like that but also rats there 'll be lots of rats some ships that have more rats and sailors right they 'd have rat hunts they know thousands and thousands of rats and kill them off in the land so owning a cat right owning a cat to haunt those rats a good melser that 's why he 's weight in gold all right also all right these cats were lucky here they were seen as lucky the luck was right if you could take a cat out with you right and come back with a cat still alive on board the ship and that that was a lucky ship right very lucky ship and it was a black cat right if you 're on a ship and a black cat comes towards you right that 's lucky if the cat comes towards black cat should go over the board or that was a cursed ship you better bet back to portal or go and steal a different chip straight away because that was a cursed ship these were the kind of things we did with cats and stuff like that what other animals we had we had the cows we talked about having cows and pigs and all those things you got to eat and stuff like that you 'd have on board and the crow right of the crew and the crow 's nest right you go out you use it as a navigational aid you know send the girl off and found out you know as the crow flies straight away between two points so we 'd follow the crew towards land or if it wasn 't landed come back and land on top of things like that and also right we used to have monkeys and pirates right as pets crazies may seem why would you have a pet well it had twofold right the monkeys and that and parrots were like exotic animals so when you got back them for a fortune right they were actually worth gold they were really valuable right really valuable right so we would do that we keep them and people in apartments began to get parrots as their own pets right because the people that own the pet the boy the parrots and the monkeys as their pets in the europe and stuff like that we 're wealthy people you know it 's a soy and a prestige to have one so you know pirate captains liking to be prestigious themselves whatever parody of their own because it gave them rank and you know make you feel good about yourself having a pet parrot and stuff like that and so that 's why we had pet parrots and pet monkeys because partly for the value partly because of the prestige are brought to us as you know sea captains and stuff like that and other animal relations you 've got animals and things like you know when you 're on these islands and stuff like that they didn 't have cows we 'd eat monkeys and snakes and all sorts of things well these are going to relationship we had with animals as we went along right so it gives you a bit of an idea of what kind of things we did all right factor fun fact about rats right that i don 't really know that they actually can last right they laugh same as us right they laugh right except there 's this high pitched right a little bit more height picture one like that they 're not ha they 're like but they have little breaks between them they laugh and look at that kind of stuff we know this right because they 're all weird bob you 're a weird bob we talked about a few toys right he used to run experiments with rats just to test this out he said tickle him like a tickle rat right it 'll laugh crazy story if it doesn 't bother children laugh some of these rats even sort of chained a bit beforehand but that 's true rats laugh just like humans that 's why they end up using a lot of testing and stuff like that because 'll laugh if you tickle them all right tell them a joke well they 're not they 're a hard audience if you 've got to tell a joke you know you don 't really understand good rat humor to get them laughing like that you know bobber could do it but the rest of us will uh we struggled we struggled now i think i 'm gonna finish up with a bit of story about me and wilson here right me and the o wilson the other day right we walked into a bar together right thinking our botch our throats are coming in that old barman right he looked at me he looked at me looked at us but the other right he looked at us and said you can 't eat coming into that magey disgusting thing i said to him he 's had his shots he 's washed him what 's wrong with that and the pyramid looked at me and said i was talking to the parrot oh he was a cheeky bugger he was he was you know what he said to me after anyway other day right he said oh he had a parent come in here with a cow on his shoulder and i said cow on his shoulder that is just because he hasn 't worked out out of milk his parrot yet ah that 'd be right [Laughter] but that that 'd be all for today 's shipmates we 'll get out of here on that note as sour as that milk might have been because we 're gonna come back next time with uh some more stuff i think we 're gonna do with a free hole the uh strongholds of par the parrots they 're the pirates and the parrots they 're strongholds and stuff like that will cover next week maybe or maybe we 'll go henry avery right he 'd be another successful pirate and interesting stories another thing i 'm thinking i 'm confident as well is some black disaster stories you know those great great plans that just went australia right because not everything works together the way it should and you know it 's important you learn the good with the bad the washes you off about both the boat and you know as well as the ones that catch you you know the fire wear a fair wind and foul is what i was trying to say there where are we from i think it was doing a parrot impersonation there i think pirate burst the nation here it goes that 's why i lost his tongue didn 't i yeah that 'd be right ah so i think we missed we 'll be done don 't i 'm gonna just take it on trust you remember when you 're putting your starboard right your bow when you 're off all right so just keep thinking about those things the important bits of ship the sailing tips you had and all those things we 've learned over this whole period so once you 're released you know from this coveness and you want to go somewhere you can think about you know taking out your sailboat and you know conquer in a few places get yourself a little booty for yourself but right now i think it 's time for us to piped down for the evening so this will be me and me good mate wilson the first mate parrot saying arrivederci by priority friends of us there _"

with them timbers remember let 's give them timbers let 's make this place shake give me an r give me another r r put them all together and spill [Laughter] right standing off like a pirate that 's it we 're good you remember your porn you starboard you do good job or interested to talk about today we 're talking about blackboard by following you roberts going to talk about some of these inches right but you know i didn 't want to give you all the wrong impressions about you know pirating and it 's all fun and games you know other things happen i was going to tell you what about my one one of my misadventures right when it didn 't quite work out it happened on land maybe that was a problem you know you know what it 's like on and all that kind of stuff not good things happen good things happen at sea that 's what i find on the beaches the beloved beaches are like myself so i was on the end and i was wondering about just wandering about you know keeping the odd sneaky eye out for the treasure all right but nope no i 'm not really seeing anything until all of a sudden i see a chicken tearing across running like a demon it was going so fast it was like poultry in motion it was amazing it was amazing so i started chasing it i don 't want to get it i run it as fast as i could but it just stayed too far out of my reach and when i stopped i pulled out my pistol right and i aimed it for it it ran out of range got just out of range and then just stood there and looked at me tearing me back in damn you and i chased it again and i 'm running and i 'm running as fast as i can but i couldn 't horse and i thought haha i got you now so i left up all the pony i took it right and i chased him and i 'm ergining it up with the flat of me cut this left and right left and right left and right as fast as i could and the horse was going for it he was he didn 't want that you know i mean it wasn 't doing me any good and i wasn 't doing the horse any good but we get chased and chasing and chasing until we just gave up exhausted we stopped because we couldn 't keep up with it and then the chicken just sort of looked us just out of range again and just crawled and then strolled off into the sunset i watched it go in his spy glass i 'm looking at his head 's towards horizon oh like that chicken has got three legs unbelievable i 'd never seen it before three legs ah so i 'm walking along the rest of the tea i 've just exhausted you know i 'm walking along i see 's carrying his pocket eggs right little metal bucket full of eggs i thought he might know something about that i said safar have you ever seen a chicken with three legs and he said aye aye that 'd be one of mine it 'd be one of mine i 'd read it special like i said really why well he says you know sunday dinner right everybody likes bold you know the drumstick everybody wants a drumstick so i think i 'll make the sunday special have a three-legged chicken right so you can share an extra drumstick every time you cook a chicken right and it make me a fortune it may be a wealthy man he said i thought it sounds bright i said what do they taste like he said i don 't know i can 't touch the blinders [Laughter] that 's right ah this is why you stick the lion never go at the land there right never want to go back to land because stay on board that 's where i know what i 'm doing and who else knew what he was pirates ever some people say he was the best pirates ever over three years right he took 400 prizes over 400 prizes all right that 's more fingers than i 've got there 400 prizes that 's a lot all right that 's a lot over just three years he was so successful and right he kind of pirated late in life all right he was 37 when he was made a captain right he 's old captain old davis or ratio davis right he died and the crew voted and they said we want all black part by the lobby roberts to be our captain and you know we 've been a sailor since he was 13 right but he hadn 't been the captain he just had different jobs there had been a professional sailors we knew what he was doing around the boat right but he 'd only been on the pirate ship for six weeks right he 's old the princess had been taken six weeks earlier and they end up sawing anyone as an extra crew member right because they need him and then he so they 'll vote for him to be captain amazing you know but yeah i love going for him right he was a good looking fellow he was tall right he 's quite bright right and he 's well built and brave he was brave he 's already shown he was a brave man well built that and he has holy dark features as well very handsome like myself and long hair and all that you know he was a snappy dresser he like wearing the silks right he had a big you know diamond crusted cross and yeah on his neck right kind of saw that and a hat and his hat right and a big red feather right that kind of stuff he used to stand in the breeze with his wind blowing his hair and the feather there like that so you know he had all that going for him you know so he looked like a pirate so they don 't know we will have him he looks good right and also like he was a bit of a purity type you know like he only the rules right everyone remember the articles we did that the week well martial roberts he was really strong on the articles right and everyone had to do what they were told so that worked out good for him all right and he did have a pretty easter tournament streak about him too uh one time right when somebody did a few times actually he 'd go there and eat all the for ransom right he 'd say if you don 't pay me the ransom i 'm gonna burn the ship in front of you and he did that 's it they didn 't pay the ransom he was just there and he watched the ship burn why there 's nothing they could do right now so he got that reputation of him steely and all that kind of stuff and he was really good at getting prizes and stuff and he was smart right smart yeah right he had four ships normally right fleet got two to four flip ships but mostly four ships right there you have them working together and every tandem right they 'd surround it all like oh it 's really smiling you know and he 'd keep working and keep working him you know he was funny with his names too like because he called him like the fortune and the good fortune and the royal fortune so not a real original but he could sort of tell you know that he was doing it you know he was there they 're all his ships and all that kind of stuff you know remember last time we were talking about flags and we ended up having like four flags right i 've got the ones we had from the flag class remember these ones right yeah the two ones we brought up last time we had two others right so that was his one of his standard sort of flags right there you got the spear and all that sort of stuff and the mug that that hourglass saying your time is short i 'm coming to get you all that sort of stuff right and he had the special one remember the barbados guys right that and he didn 't like him right the two islands so we used that one flag easter when was around there right and that was basically the skulls of somebody from barbados and that 's one from martinique right so that was how he sort of scared him off you know that kind of stuff because he was pretty scary and he swore vengeance against all them like that so they were scared of him you know he was good at selling himself as a pirate one of his best ever adventures right one of his best evidence big prizes and like herself so there 's a whole fortune he 's portuguese fleet right a treasure ships okay they 're like an old bar right being the sneaky and brave sort of bugger he was right he pulls in behind the fleet on the convoy right just joined tags over the end he 's just sailing along with all these ships right and they hadn 't really noticed him right he 's got the right flags and all that stuff and tag a long tag along and then pulled up into a bay around brazil right he took it over right to go with an air ship right got a hold of it then he 's got the captain right the master of the other ship he said now which one of these ships here which one of these ships here has the most loot on it was that symbols treasure and they went oh be that one over there and so he went ah right so he jumped back on his ship right they sailed straight over to it attacked it boarded it right took over the ship he got his ship and that ship and they sailed off straight away right before the other ships and they 're all in the convoy knew what happened i only had all these gunships there protecting that but they didn 't see what was happening until i realized what was going on and he was over the risen all right and they never caught him so he ran off for the ship because he was brave and courageous all right you know lots of stuff like that he did you know there was another time right where newfoundland right he come up to that port right had 22 ships that anchored the port and he attacked and he burned and trashed 21 of them right and kept the other one for himself done to his crew it 'd be a good somehow there you know the fortune something like this you know right he did all that kind of stuff right and he 's mothership the real main ship right his main ship right that was the royal fortune and that bee a huge big frigate used to the oslo right then he turned in his you know he shipped the good fort and changed the name and made it a pirate ship with five names right and that was a match of the queen anne which was the biggest pirate ship that ever lived right so that 's how he was he was courageous and braver and you know a little bit too proud probably in the long run because that 's what got him in the end i 'm afraid right because you know he was doing so much damage like 400 trips all right know the english government right the king sent off the hms swallow right a big mighty battleship to hunt him down right and so he already lost right the great ranger was one of his ships right he lost that great range into the swallowing so he 'd already done that and eventually the swallow had got him at anchor i used that anchor in a bay and the swallows appeared right it was around breakfast time and the crews rushed down and said captain captain captain the swallow 's here and what did he do oh he 's a bit cocky by this stage here all bart and he said what i 'll finish my breakfast so he sat elegantly finished his breakfast as he 's an elegant man would have you know rubbed his mouth and all this kind of stuff and he 's come out of the deck but instead of running like a smart pirate like me in the beaches we would 've just been wow straight out of there like that you know amazing let 's go all right that 's how we would have but no he thought oh you 'll take this big ship on because i am black bart king of the pirates even called himself the king of the leeward islands at that stage that 's what he said no leeway 's the other side of the wind right now that the wind 's going to exactly wood side but that 's what he called it because of the way the islands were in those places the wind that 's the way the winds worked there right that 's why you call himself that okay so but he was courageous so he said no i 'm gonna take it on and so then he assailed directly towards the swallow he didn 't attack it just took it head-on as a brave man that he was hire but you remember i told you that expression one of those other classes right about long shot remember i said the cannons are really unlucky let 's see a long shot come from if you were lucky if you hit it that 's where long shot is lucky to happen or that kind of stuff from the swallow right and that was ship firing grape you know and we talked about the cannons a couple classes back as well actually probably a lot of classes back there i think there 's near the beginning right but grapes like lots of small shells they package them up and then explodes as they go and it shatters out right so it just randomly rips through everything and through all the wreaking and all that kind of stuff it does a lot of damage all around the place it just shoots out but not really accurate at all right but they so they 've shot the first lot it 's been great right it 's just ripped through and of course all bart is right up the front daring and cheering and blowing his pure lawn and getting there and what 's happened a bit of grapes hit him through the neck ripped he 's thrown out and he was dead that 's it he was gone it 's just like that all that bravery come to north all right at the end and what happened next well the articles so his articles were you know in battle if somebody should pass away right in battle you toss him over the edge get him out of the road so he can do the fighting otherwise you 're going to be tripping over him all those kind of stuff so what happened was they tossed him overboard of course as soon as the old pirates realized they didn 't really know what they were doing and in the middle this big battle with a swallow which massively outgoned him and all that sort of stuff they had all these troopers and all this sort of stuff there they just surrendered straight away and that was the end of bats crew as well they 're all captured and taken away for trial and all that sort of stuff and so ends another pirate adventure with black bart ah see crazy stuff this part so you 've got some good stories and some bad stories so you know so you can make an educated decision when you get to the end of the course whether you want to be a pirate it might be time for us to give one more r or perhaps another r and perhaps we could put them all together and they would in fact spell [Laughter] that 's right we 've come to the end of question number 18 which means next one is 19 only 19 sounds like a good day for a pirate song i think only 19. oh well i know what also might happen soon maybe for class 20 i think if we 're going to get to 20 i might think about it could be time to do some laundering of these pirate clues because otherwise i won 't be able to creep up on anyone they 'll know where they 're coming me and the are going oh my goodness that coming we gotta get out of here anyway talking about getting out of here i 'm gonna pipe us all down and be seeing you next week bye old shipmates arrived [Music] [Laughter] hahahahahahaha _"

    "text": "all right folks we 've got a few more people coming in but it looks like um almost everyone is here so we might kick off now um so hi welcome everybody um my name 's charlie i 'm here from the city of canterbury bankstown um and thank you for joining us for this electric vehicle webinar sorry i 'm just still admitting people as i talk so i 'll just be multitasking here for a second um first of all um before we start proceedings i 'd like to acknowledge the darrigan euro peoples who are the traditional custodians of the land we are mostly on today probably and pay respect to elders past present and future and if there are any aboriginal and torres strait islander community members here with us today on the webinar we thank you for the protection of culture people and land um great so uh apart from myself here with us today we 've got three electric vehicle experts um one of whom is actually a local cannery bankstown resident from earlwood we 've got alex from the electric vehicle council and you 'll get a chance to hear from all of these experts today and if you have any questions that pop up as they 're presenting just hold on to them and at the end you 'll get a chance to ask them and hopefully we 'll get through all of those questions by seven o 'clock and give me a second here um so before i hand over to alex alex will present first um i just wanted to talk really briefly about council 's journey with electric vehicles and why we decided to hold this webinar today to promote this technology roughly two years ago council started to integrate electric vehicles into our fleet which was a big change for us at council and currently we 've got 14 electric vehicles in our fleet and we plan to add more in future uh overall the experience for council has been incredibly positive our staff really love driving the vehicles they 're very cheap to run they 're very easy to maintain and the driving experience is fantastic take it from me fantastic um and you may also have street sweeper to give our residents a little bit more beauty sleep in the mornings when the street sweepers are running the streets um so there are applications beyond the traditional sedan electric vehicle that most of us would be familiar with so overall council 's had a really positive experience with electric vehicles and we would like to educate you and promote that technology to you so when it comes time to buy your next car hopefully you 'll consider electric vehicles uh or an electric vehicle as an option um so that 's it from me uh i will hand over to alex if you 're ready alex if you can share your screen and take it away oh thanks charlie hi everyone um my name 's alex i 'm from the electric vehicle council and we 're the peak national body representing the electric vehicle industry so we work with electric vehicle manufacturers charging infrastructure providers energy companies and anyone else in the eva industry that might have an interest in accelerating the uptake of electric vehicles today i 'm going to run you through a bit australia and a few things that are currently being done by government to accelerate uptake to start with i thought i 'd just quickly run through the types of electric vehicles so you 've got your pure battery electric vehicle these are typical teslas your nissan leaf your kona 's eye pacers this list is not exhaustive but these are vehicles that run solely on batteries so they don 't have an internal combustion engine and they don 't have a petrol component we have the plug-in hybrid electric vehicle so that actually has two drive trains one of them is a small battery and then additionally it has the engine the battery will power you for up to about 50 kilometers and then it will revert to the petrol engine so seeing today 's attack transition technology for people who aren 't quite comfortable with the range on offer but still wanting to make the change in terms of emissions reductions for those shortest city and metro trips the third one is the hybrid electric vehicle and this one has become increasingly popular in australia it 's a technically an electric motor you don 't plug it into recharge so this is basically a fuel efficient vehicle but not necessarily what the electric vehicle council would consider an electric vehicle in that it doesn 't plug in to recharge and it does release emissions even when it 's using its motor very quickly when we look at charging there are different levels of charging um and it can be quite confusing to get your head around some of these things but the first point that i 'd like to make is that if you have a power point you can charge your car so if you 're driving somewhere and there 's powerpoint by the side of the road you know you 're at a server and they 're going to let you use it you can still charge if you want to use your garage power points without installing the hardware you can technically do that now it does say here that you know it takes eight to seven hours 8.7 hours to recharge your car but the likelihood of you using the full range of your vehicle time to add 100 kilometers of range is going to be significantly lower if you 're using your power point the other option for your garage or off street parking is this level two wall charger and that 's typically between one to two thousand dollars it can be very easily installed and will help you manage charging a little bit quicker than your typical powerpoint otherwise you 'll start looking at destination charges so you might see these now in shopping centers westfield and vicinity centers have got quite a few of these they 're the kind of things you might charge with when you 're going to the supermarket or you 're watching a movie um and then the level three fast chargers are the ones we 're typically seeing on highways and that 's to help people interact with them as though they 're petrol stations so you know if your drive revive survive and those kind of trips that you 're taking so getting into the australian context now electric vehicle sales have been low but from we see a three-fold increase in 2019 on 2018 this actually in the next two weeks that will show a significant increase again in electric vehicle sales interestingly covert has not had an effect on electric vehicle sales in australia they 've remained steady throughout the first six months of 2020 and we don 't foresee that there will be a significant impact on sales in the coming months either so something that 's typically been a barrier to electric vehicle uptake in australia is model availability and you can see from this chart that you know there were some models available in 2011 and there are increasingly more models available now i can tell you that there 's 28 models available in australia at the moment six of those are under sixty thousand dollars so we 're starting to see more models become available at lower price points which provides a little bit more access to people who aren 't looking for vehicles in the luxury vehicle segment just so you have some idea of what is around and what 's coming i think a lot of people think electric vehicles they think teslas and these kinds of 300 billion dollars has been invested by car manufacturers globally in electric vehicles and it is really what they are seeing as the future of road transport particularly in the passenger vehicle segment so you 're starting to see stronger commitments from traditional petrol manufacturers and diesel manufacturers making commitments as part of emission production targets in the electric vehicle space and this is only growing what we do have here is a limitation on model availability and that 's just a result of lack of government policy at a federal level so lack of fuel efficiency standards means we 're getting more polluting vehicles as opposed to more efficient vehicles for reference in the uk at the moment there are about 130 electric vehicles for sale and as i mentioned earlier there 's only 28 in australia so that 's the difference that we 're seeing between the two right-hand drive markets now another barrier to uptake for electric vehicles is the cost and and we appreciate that you know the sixty thousand dollar vehicle is not affordable for many people but what we will see in the coming will the cost of the vehicle and that 's because fifty percent of an electric vehicle 's price at the moment is made up by the battery pack but in the coming years we 'll see the cost of lithium-ion batteries go down and they 're projected to fall another 10 by 2024 we 're expecting in other markets to see price parity with electric vehicle and internal combustion engine vehicles by 2024 we might see this a little bit later in australia because we haven 't got quite the policy environment that supports this acceleration yet so it 's really important that we do start to uptake these vehicles particularly because our carbon dioxide emissions intensity for light vehicles in australia is not getting any better in the last year we 've only seen a 0.2 decrease in the emissions intensity just by an uptake of electric vehicles and more efficient vehicles coming to market so it 's really important that we consider what the overall australian fleet is doing in terms of carbon emissions reductions for transport emissions in australia and you can see here that different vehicle but what really is driving electric vehicle sales is private vehicle sales and that 's because consumers are starting to see what role they have in choosing more environmentally friendly options and more health conscious options for transport in australia charging infrastructure is of course a very significant barrier to uptake i mean it 's a new technology and you know everyone 's really aware of how to refuel their petrol and diesel cars but suddenly it 's what am i going to do how am i going to charge we know from research to 80 of people actually charge their vehicles at home so understanding that the average consumer is you know driving back to base daily and actually refueling in a more convenient way rather than having to go to a petrol station you can now go home plug in while you go to sleep wake up in the morning and your car 's refueled as i mentioned earlier it 's unlikely you 'll have to fill a full tank every day just like you wouldn 't need to pull refuel your petrol tank fully every day either infrastructure you can see here that it 's increased 140 to last year in mid-2019 and i can tell you again this figure has increased will be released in the coming weeks um dc charges are those high level charges that i was telling you about so the highway charges um that will refuel quicker and then ac charging stations and more those typical destination charges where you might spend longer periods of time so we know that the environment is a really important thing to consider when we are looking at how we can as individuals reduce our carbon emissions and impacts but additionally electric vehicle ownership will do significant benefits for public health so we 've actually calculated in some ebc research last year that more people are dying in australia or in the sorry the new south wales newcastle wollongong sydney region uh from transport related fuel emissions deaths then from road accidents so these deaths aren 't actually included in road emissions estimates and safety consensuses in australia but what we are asking government to do is start looking at what the impact of fuel emissions made by electrifying our vehicle fleet additionally there are a lot of industry development opportunities in australia and when we 've seen a really significant uptake of solar pv and particularly the new south wales government has made strong commitments to really charging the renewable energy space this has mean really great for electric vehicles because you 're going to be powering on renewable energy but additionally we can start developing an onshore circular lithium-ion battery economy and what that means is we can start manufacturing processing and recycling batteries from electric vehicles so that we are really making sure that we 're using safe and fair products in cars that we 're driving so when we talk about policy we know that different states are all up to different uh stages in western australia south australia victoria we 're expecting to see some new policy commitments in the coming months the federal government was due to release the policy last year in 2019 unfortunately that 's been delayed again till december this year and potentially after that um these policies are intended to accelerate electric vehicle uptake so that in our market cheaper prices you know we really push for incentives to help people afford electric vehicles but additionally we make strong policy advocation for electric public transport for considering electric vehicle charging infrastructure in new builds and and other public charging investment so things like how can we fund a federal highway in that kind of thing in new south wales uh they 've actually released a policy earlier this year as part of the net zero plan so there 's been a strong commitment there of money to fund fast public charging networks and that 's really to facilitate and break down that barrier of range anxiety so that consumers are now more aware of charging infrastructure and you know they can get from a to b without running out of charge additionally uh we 've committed to electrify our buses so 8 000 of sydney 's buses there 's been eois over the last few months for industry participants to put forward the applications to be part of that transition so new south wales has really started to make some moves this year and so it stacking up where federal government policy isn 't necessarily doing as much or anything at the moment actually councils are really important in the change um you know 94 councils in australia have declared a climate emergency and they 've actually been leading the way on electric electrification in australia uh since you know five years ago canterbury bankstown has had some great initiatives you know the electric vehicle fleet transition public charging infrastructure and there are other community projects that i know are going on in the background that are really going to help raise consumer awareness and and help with the transition at a community level they 're a really good body and way to get information at a grassroots level i mean we all know what state governments are doing but we don 't necessarily interact with them that much so having support from a council that really wants to see this change happen is a really positive thing just a few resources if you 're after a bit more information so the first one there 's the electric vehicle council website the nrmas also got quite 've made very strong investment in electric vehicles they really see it as the future of road transport so they 're a really good source of information the driven is a news website that uh uses news from australia but also from other markets just to tell you what 's going on everything on that website is to do with electric vehicles it 's a purely electric vehicle news website car advice has recently started uh doing quite a lot more about electric vehicles and so it 's interesting to see how electric vehicles are now moving and being spoken about in the mainstream media quite a lot and then you 've got the australian electric vehicle association resources and two people on the line to definitely answer some of the consumer-based questions and they 're a really important tool because you know they 're the ones with the cars and they 've got the technology and they 're proving you know it can happen now and they 've been really passionate about the acceleration for a few years the other tools that are available the nrma has a cost and then it will help you find potential transition vehicles what cars could you supplement for your petrol to get an electric and then additionally there 's the plug share charger location map so you can put in your location and it will tell you where charges are around your area if they 're in use what size they are and many other things that 's it from me and i 'll save the rest for questions fantastic thanks alex that 's great i particularly like the slide where you outlined um how great councils are in particular canterbury bank sound council that 's good to know um so i 'll hand over to michael now who 's from the australian electric vehicle association um and also to his colleague mark who is our local resident from the same organization um michael take it away when you 're ready let me see i 'll just select the right page so let me see if i got the yes that looks good let me see if i can get it up in the right mode can you still still see that for a moment that 's fine we 're all used to these tech issues these days with our zoom calls the problem with the multi models there we go i 'm hoping you see that now yes that 's perfect thanks michael take it away all good so hello and welcome thank you charlie for the the opportunity to talk um my name is michael day i 'm the national treasure of the electric vehicle association and also the new south wales branch chairman and also with me is mark roberts he 's the the branch secretary um and unfortunately i don 't have a slide for for uh mark 's cars but this is my collection of evs so i 've got two at the moment the the lotus which is under construction my electric scooter which is my daily ride uh and my original vehicle which is the toyota mr2 it was a car that i converted about 10 years ago and have unfortunately sold and upgraded to to the lotus a little bit about us the electric vehicle association so formed in 1973 a not-for-profit organization and in every capital city about a thousand members and accelerating um through various largely because of the the push and the range of electric vehicles coming in but some accelerating quite quickly which is nice to see um but we are the builders um as myself uh the owners mark as an example business owners and ev lobbyists and advocates um you know mark and i as an example were in the executive so you move from being someone that 's sort of passionate about it that 's just something that 's a lobbyist and likes to talk about it um but largely thus far we 've been the tinker on early adopters if you 're looking in that curve of product adoption it 's still early days and so it 's people like me and my friends that tinker away in our garage and build our electric vehicles uh or you 're someone like uh the tesla 's tesla owners that have got uh the new vehicles out there and uh paid that little bit of a premium to be an early adopter and um uh explore new worlds aren 't really that new they 've been around for for quite a long time it 's just been uh that they weren 't the most practical vehicles of their day and were quickly supplanted by by petrol vehicles um and in fact in 1973 when we first started they were a little bit of an oddball and it 's really taken a few years for for the technology and probably the requirement for electric vehicles to to become a thing like now but if we talk to our members on the wise and wear force why would you build why would you own an electric vehicle it comes down to a few things uh cheap to run and maintain i mean my electric scooter costs me nothing to run because i 've got solar cells and i charge it off charge it from my solar system um unique and interesting vehicles well i 've got um an electrified lotus elise and we 've got some other really interesting vehicles in the club and if you look um internationally there 's a real trend now for converting your near classic move it away from the uh noxious and and probably unreliable uh petrol vehicle and make it an electric vehicle at a second life um there 's performance i mean this probably comes from a tesla owner because they they do have the performance energy security um like i say like if there 's uh i don 't need to go out and buy petrol i can i run my vehicles from my solar system so it 's all generated right here and of course it 's better for the environment and that 's really the cool thing from an electric vehicle association perspective is that if you look at the pollution carbon pollution emissions globally then transportation is a really big percentage of that and it 's growing but from a personal perspective from a buyer perspective from someone out on the street perspective i mean we all have a hand in that we might not have um be that involved in agriculture or industry or uh buildings uh and the energy efficiency of those things but things that we can do things that we can do by our ourselves make the decision to go out and buy an electric vehicle and have the benefits and benefits and hopefully um uh have a better more sustainable transport here locally so that 's really the the core the drive from from aiva perspective but if you look at the at the questions that we get we get a lot of questions we do a lot of presentations we we go to uh when we can when it 's not pandemics we go out and we have drive days and we do shows and we go to uh driving issues where you get people in electric vehicles so we get a lot of questions about the whys and wherefores and probably the most the frequent ones are where does the engine most of our energy comes from coal isn 't that um meaning that we 're not really as effective as efficient from a sustainability perspective as uh as we 'd say and and we will respond um by saying that whilst australia 's energy mix is predominantly coal um each year our grid is getting greener and greener and will gets greener and greener so it 's um unlike your electric vehicle uh unlike you 're sorry unlike your petrol vehicle that 'll never get any greener it 'll always get probably less efficient well your electric vehicle every year on year will get get greener and greener as our grid gets greener and greener and then if you just look at the raw numbers if you do look at the direct comparison from the wheel-to-well scenarios electric vehicles are more efficient vehicles i mean if you imagine a my electric vehicle sitting in a set of traffic lights well it 's not actually running it 's just sitting there uh as opposed to a petrol vehicle well it 'll sit there and idle and burn fuel whilst you 're sitting in traffic or your electric vehicle can reach in if it goes downhill it can generate energy from the momentum of going downhill so i get a little bit of a benefit along the way not something you can do in a petrol vehicle another question how long do the batteries last well there 's some really well documented 000 kilometers to 2 million kilometers these of course are in fleets um some notable ones in the u.s tesla 's in the u.s and interestingly what they 're finding is that the cars are actually having issues so your seats your brakes your mechanical bits and pieces are starting to wear out quicker uh than batteries so they 're actually got a reason a long lifespan and generally not the limitation of of a modern battery electric vehicle in the past perhaps some of the early electric vehicles but definitely not now definitely a lot of the kinds of vehicles that you see in the hyundai 's the onyx the jaguars and of course the teslas and then there 's the um batteries can be recycled as as alex mentioned before um 90 i think 80 or 90 percent of the materials that go into a lithium battery can be recycled the lithium the metal the high value metals the coppers and things can all be recycled and should be and probably the last question is what happens if if you run out of charge when you 're driving much because you 're really generally pretty aware of what your vehicle is capable of and my electric vehicles basically i charge at home i treat it like my iphone i get home at night i plug it in get up in the morning i unplug it and i drive it 's actually really convenient and i don 't have to go to petrol stations and it 's not really a thing that i worry about um because it 's a daily drive around town if i have to go out on the highways and byways if i have to go a longer run then there 's an app for that and um but there 's for those sorts of things to find charging stations and if you 're lucky enough to own a tesla then there just a little bit more about the charging so um again a little bit about my the way i operate so to speak but more generally how our members operate is that most of their cars are parked they use it they 're driven for a few hours every day to get to for a long time they 're parked at parking stations or workplaces for a long time which means there 's a lot of opportunity to charge and generally um they charge in the one to four hours because you 're not going to complete this charge you 're not um emptying your battery so you 've got a lot of potential to charge especially at home um and i was lucky enough to charge at work as well so um and my daily drive um i had plenty of opportunity to charge and i always had a full battery um mark you 'd probably comment that as well uh absolutely michael um one thing that people don 't may not have thought of is that uh because you 're charging at home you 're charging every single day that you drive the car and therefore for for an uh a nice car you might put petrol in it once a week or something you 're actually more likely to um run out of petrol than you are out of electricity because of the fact that you might forget to put another point um the um yeah the uh the cost of uh charge of charging electric cars is is peanuts because the fact that you for start you could be using solar but even if you don 't have solar on your roof you 'll be charging it mostly overnight when you get home from work or when you you you know when you finish the day you can set up your car easily to charge using off-peak power which is a lot cheaper than normal power um so the costs are quite low for running it it works out to be like if you have a petrol car you might be using something like thirteen thousand oh sorry three thousand dollars per year for petrol for an electric car it would probably be about ten percent of that interestingly um one of our members drove around australia and is tesla and i think he mentioned that it cost him around a hundred dollars to drive around australia my parents were around australia in their in their four-wheel drive and it cost them four thousand dollars so i mean that i mean um i know mark 's got solar i 've got solo so we charge our our vehicles for free yeah um the other thing is a lot of places um where you can charge that are not at home don 't charge you any money to charge so for instance if you go to a shopping center that has a an electric vehicle charging spot you you it 's almost certain that you won 't have to pay a cent you just plug drive in plug in do your chopping come back an hour later and drive off that 's it um and um so there 's there 's various ways that you can charge your car if you look at this diagram that michael 's just put up the picture on the bottom left has a a plug on it which plugs into a normal gpo the other end plugs into the car um that would be normally kept in the boot although you may in whatever your circumstances are you may have that set up at home um as well more likely you 'll have the home or the one in the middle at the right set up at home now there 's two standards there 's type one and there 's type two type one is on the left at the top type two is the the right on the top now type two is becoming the most common standard type one is is starting to fade away it 's mainly based on an american japanese standard which is not really where we have available three-phase power and the type two standard works with three-phase type one doesn 't the other point to note is the plug on the bottom right which is used with the charger in the middle on the right so what you do is you plug one end of that plug into the into the charger and the other end to you into your car um so that that works with all the modern cars that are coming in now and those are some of the speeds and feeds i mean these are all typically destinational home charges yeah um pretty much everyone 's got a 10 amp plug and that that they quote is the average person drives 40 kilometers per day if you drive 40 kilometers per day any car that you could buy from way back in 2012 would happily do that um there 's also options for getting a much cheaper car such as a second-hand nissan leaf or buying a grey import car there are companies out available now which do grow imports and they even give you a a warranty and a service plan for the car so that 's no longer an issue that it used to be that you people were afraid of buying grey import cars particularly electric cars because they were afraid that the dealer wouldn 't support them well that 's not so much of an issue now um i 'd imagine the dealer would still give you a better deal a better service army but um it 's not it 's not the only option um now if you 're a family with two cars and one of them isn 't electric it 's actually crazy because electric cars are so much more reliable and cheap to operate that work out quite a lot better i 've got a link that i 'm going to put into the comments section as soon as i can work out how to do it which shows a comparison of the prices of the cars uh the characteristics of the cars it 's on the the over website so it 's it must be good so i suggest people have a look at that uh are you talking about the cost of ownership of the car product the maintenance no no i 'm talking about the uh the fact sheets for the cars oh okay yes so what you 're doing that well just um i 'll just talk about the slide there 's some some typical fast charges and i think i picked the ugliest ones i could find the ugliest and oldest ones i could find in that particular slide they 're slightly more modern and more attractive it 's probably not the right terms for fast chargers but fast chargers are typically on your highways and byways for those longer runs um you don 't really need fast charging for top-up um when you want to go somewhere when you 're we 're heading out of town or you 're heading up or down on the coast yeah but as i said before michael if you 've a typical family that has two cars you can easily keep one car for the long trips um and the other one is the one that does most of the work around the city that is true um just some typical speeds and feeds for the different ac or dc uh sorry dc fast chargers um that are out there right now and like i say they 're expensive infrastructure um things that you 'll see out on the longer runs um where we 'd like to see them out on the um on the edges of the cities so you can get your top up before just before you leave the edge of sydney for example and then along the highways as you head up and down the coast and that 's where um the teslas of the world have been so successful and then uh even nrma is an example we members in places that are in um small towns and populate areas where you can go and visit and stop and they 'll drag you into or um encourage you into the local areas to get charged and spend some time there places of interest place of interest very much yeah nrma is not so much interested in putting their charges into petrol stations on the side of the freeway but they are interested in putting them where people can go and do something just some interesting sidelines that if you look at the typical car electric car as opposed to your typical house battery well your typical car is about four times the capacity battery capacity is your is your typical home as a function and there 's a slot there 's little bit more to this story because on average as uh mark said that we travel about 40 kilometers per day which means we only use a small percentage uh of the uh battery of the charge in our car meaning that we 've got a lot of capacity left there 's a lot of capacity left now about vehicle to grid scenarios because you can literally power your house off your car or companies may be uh willing to buy the charge back from your vehicle at peak times and pay your money for it there 's a lot of debate in the car club about that about um why i would let why anyone would let a company to use the charge impact my car impact my range impact by battery why would i do that and it comes down to well you might get a fair amount of money for it one day along the way so you 've got a lot of spare capacity there if i can make two points uh number one um something that michael has alluded to but hasn 't really stated is that if you 're thinking about buying electric car one thing you should definitely do is come to some ava meetings where you 'll meet lots of people who know what they 're talking about and they can guide you in the direction that you should go like for instance if you don 't have us be a concern for you how do you charge your car we can talk to you about that um other things like you know the cost how you don 't have a lot of money how do you finance your car we we can talk to you about all of those things um yeah what was the other thing um i forgot my other point all good points there 's lots of people that are really passionate about electric vehicles about um electric transport uh there 's uh organizations that uh we talk to a lot of and bring uh electric vehicles in and have a look at we talked to the manufacturers a lot we talked to the v council a lot we talked to the the charge station providers a lot we talked to insurance and um and um finance a lot as well there 's got some interesting companies now that have got specific uh policies or um options for electric vehicles financing electric vehicles um just some um last thoughts um so the late adopters the people who come now apart from market myself well look um practical for the australian use case uh the european use case um the reduced costs will make them much more attractive where we 're starting to see volumes start to come in options to come in when it comes to electric vehicles um with larger batteries means you 've got greater discretion when you can charge meaning you 're less reliant on charging every night although you probably will you 're less reliant on charging um at uh flipping fast charges along the way although you probably will when um when the need occurs uh and basically when you look at the the types of journeys that we see the the highest amount of charging will be based in fleet bases or at home 75 to 80 75 to 90 of your charge will be at home the next next will be um in destination um what did mark say that was the truth um sorry michael you 're dropping out um the destination charging is uh things like at work or shopping centers points are recharging and they 're encouraging you to stop and um see the buy the last will be exactly and then also be um uh accommodations as well so it 'll be heavily biased electric charging is heavily biased towards the home um and the out of home networks are are a lot less in general terms but interestingly quite important when you 're out in the byways and and you need a uh electric charge to go from uh from city to the country or from uh city to brisbane and the like oh one point um back in the old days when michael and i first started in this game there were no fast charges out in the country now there are plenty so if you 're worried about running out of charge out in the country don 't because there are lots of charging out there 's lots of charging out there so we know several people that have been around the country and in fact um mark not that long ago did a trip from sydney down to tasmania from uh for our annual general meeting in tasmania so that 's right first generation nissan leaf yeah okay well thank yes thank you michael and thank you mark for that was fantastic um i particularly like the uh your cars that you put up there michael the pictures of your cars and it may make you feel a little old but i was actually born in 1989 when your first electric vehicle was manufactured well that was my one of my dream vehicles when i was a teenager um so i bought at a later stage uh and thought well i 'm not just going to have an interesting electric vehicle i 'm going to have a sports car i wanted a sports car so i didn 't want you know an oddball community car i wanted something that was kind of fun uh i kind of got a little bit addicted from there and of course got the scooter for practicality and got the lotus because it 's super cool it doesn 't do cool factor it definitely matters i would agree with that um so we have about 15 minutes for questions i know there 's already been some questions come through on the chat so for everyone screen um a chat button and a q a button i believe either one if you wanted to type a question in feel free to and we 'll do our best to answer it there has been a few a few come through already okay first question from marlene this is an interesting one i think michael you already touched on this can petrol cars be converted to evs yes yes so like i say the electric vehicle association it was literally started in 1973 and that 's what they did they converted uh electric vehicles sorry it converted petrol vehicles to electric vehicles um and if i just share again so my my three vehicles uh the mr2 uh was a petrol vehicle built in 1989 i converted into thousand i think it was um my electric scooter um came out as a purpose-built electric scooter from the manufacturer um but it was a uh they build scooters v-moda 's build scooters and so that was um modified from their base platform uh and the lotus my lotus is a 2002 lotus uh it was converted to electric in and so a lot of the resources that we 've got a lot of the education a lot of the the background about what we do in ava is helping people convert electric vehicles convert petrol vehicles to electric vehicles great fantastic marlene 's just followed up there and this is always a very difficult question i know but she just asks what it would cost roughly to convert a petrol vehicle to a an electric vehicle so if you if you do it reasonably they 've got some smart people in the club that have converted some really nice cars to electric vehicle and use it every day and that 's probably a 15 to 20 000 if you 're someone that 's mildly insane like me who likes sports cars then that 's a more expensive affair i 've got some my expensive base cars so they have fifteen twenty thousand dollar affairs uh and that 's cost me another thirty or forty thousand dollars to do it um i wouldn 't advocate that um i 'm uh uh an electric electrical engineer by trade so um you it 's kind of my hobby and if you convert anything if you modify hot rods or if you restore cars you 're going to spend a lot of time money money effort and energy in doing that so you can spend a lot of time on these things and you get really big trouble with your wife but i digress um but you can do it reasonably as well so it 's about a fifteen to twenty thousand dollar affair the one thing i would say is that you regardless of what you convert whether it 's a scooter or whether it 's a sports car it 's something that you 've really got to have a bit of passion for um because you 'll have it for a long time yeah it 's a bit like i have a mate that um restored a mustang and he put hundreds of thousands of dollars in it and sold it for nothing well not a lot um it 's the same thing with these things you 're going to to build a car that 's really for you it 's much value for someone else but i think that 's why we 're seeing a lot of conversions particularly in the us and the uk where they 're taking sort of the near classic sports car the vws the early porsches the bmws um and they 're building lightweight kits that go straight into the car um but that doesn 't affect the car or doesn 't cut into the car so that they can have a second life for these near classic electric vehicles a bit like my lotus if you will fantastic oh miley just said thank you for that very thorough answer michael um edward has asked um how far off are we from different vehicle types vans utes trucks etc and i know that from a council perspective we 've certainly looked into other technologies that are out there um sedans and obviously the most well-known and the most common they 're the ones that we see on the streets but um council 's recently invested in an electric street sweeper which is a quite a large vehicle truck size i would say and we 've is obviously a very very large very heavy-duty vehicle so i know that those things do exist out there but perhaps you guys and maybe alex you can you can have a chat about that as well about um do you see sales numbers for those vehicles as well or do you just focus on the on that that sedan market yes so we focus on all of the vehicle segments for electric vehicles so passenger vehicles like commercial light truck medium duty truck um and heavy vehicles in the specialized vehicle space so things like those garbage trucks the thing about australia is we 're actually about 10 years behind the rest of the world so when we talk about model availability we 're not only talking about passenger vehicles we 're talking about all models that exist in all vehicle segments so in the uk for example you 're already able to get you know a big size ban the e-sprinter the evito is already available and it 's been available for the last year it 's just that because we don 't have the positive policy environments australia we 're not seeing those models here what we have got in australia however is one of the world 's first ev truck manufacturers so a company called c electric uh they do drive train conversions of the chassis and bodies of lots of different truck manufacturers primarily fuso isuzu and hino and they have very strong relationships with those truck manufacturers and intend to start building you know different assemble kicks and things so that we 'll start to see more of them on our streets already companies like ikea are using electric trucks in australia so in queensland new south wales victoria and south australia they have electric trucks um we 've got as mentioned you know postie bikes are being used by the canberra australia post so we do have the vehicles available in a global sense but it 's just in australia we aren 't getting those vehicles here yet and and and we need to start making the case the fuel efficiency standards so we start getting that vehicle allocation yeah fantastic michael and mark do you have any kind of comments on that with with with sedans mainly but that 's it mostly consumer vehicles that is true uh and alex is right sorry mike um that uh we our goal is to normalize electric vehicles um but you have the conversations with people as we do with our vehicles uh and you get them across the line they 're really interested and then the next question will be or the final question will be where do i go to buy my next vehicle and hopefully it 's electric and it 's really hard right now because there aren 't the ranges available that would really like to get into the country um and i i think well we think that the the policy position is really not helping us and there 's other things but that would be really helpful and it will be great in when it is normalized in countries like norway where 50 of the sales of car sales in that country are electric vehicles it means that their neighbor has an electric vehicle your relative has an electric vehicle it 's not an oddity it 's not something available and it 's normal i do have one question for you charlie which i think someone else has actually asked on the chats how long do you keep your cars in the council before you sell them um what 's the process well the the situation may be a little different with the electric vehicles but generally we keep our petrol vehicles we have a policy for keeping them for a certain amount of years i believe it 's roughly five and then selling them on but i 'm not sure how that would apply to electric vehicles i mean as you guys well know maintaining them is a lot easier than it is with petrol vehicles so the equation changes a lot i think um and the cars holding their value i think would be very different so we started purchasing electric vehicles two years ago so um i don 't think we 've made a final determination on on how long we 'll keep them but so far it 's been a really positive experience so i 'd like to see just keep them as long as looking for a second-hand car yourself for instance would be a great source for them so they they 're um they 're interested in what you 're doing with your cars so typically council the councils are holding electric vehicles for longer but they are looking just like state governments are adopting electric vehicles specifically with the intention to feed the second-hand market so while they don 't have determinate terms the lease terms for electric vehicles is definitely on the brow that those vehicles will feed the second-hand market particularly to make a more equitable access of the technology to people who can 't necessarily afford those vehicles but again because of reduced maintenance they are being held for longer so you 're not going to necessarily see them feed into the secondhand market probably for the next five years and you know councils are changing their fleet policy across australia to actually make sure they hold the vehicles for longer because it 's giving them better returns so that 's the trend um from other councils as well yeah absolutely alex i think we 're very much in think you were the first person to ask this question i i actually missed it um much of the discussion so far talks about house and charging on your house however people in apartments represent a significant group and they will increasingly represent a significant group in sydney stephen asks what is council doing to provide charging facilities for apartment dwellers that do not have charging available to them at home and that 's a great question stephen i 'll throw it to you guys to talk about apartments more in general okay there 's two things number one uh council needs to set up some sort of guidelines for new buildings new apartments new houses so that they have some sort of facility for charging now even if you own a house and you don 't have an electric car you hate electric cars eventually you 'll move on or you 'll die or something like that and the house will still need to be used to charge a car by someone else in the future similarly apartment buildings if you can park on the in the apartment building needs to be some sort of facility to do that and this is uh well and truly in council 's ballpark to create guidelines and standards that should be followed by new buildings just on that uh the new south wales government has actually committed to update the building regulation in new south wales so that new developments and builds will have to install the electrical capacity to facilitate electric vehicle charging so there is already that movement at a new south wales level additionally the national construction code is being updated to also include the provision so there 's definitely movement at those state and federal government spaces as well yeah i think we 're we 're also following suit there sorry michael um and as we update our planning documents and planning instruments we are really pushing to get electric vehicle charging into all of those newer buildings i guess for all the people who are living now in apartment buildings that don 't have an electric charger available to them council 's actually installed publicly available charges um in public spaces so there 's one for instance the campsie town center that 's just within our lga there 's multiple as you guys have talked about across sydney um and we don 't we do have uh we have undertaken a lot of work with strata managers to get things like electric vehicle charges in in apartment buildings within rlj and that 's you know that 's obviously ongoing work that takes some time but council is trying to provide charges for people who don 't have that opportunity to charge in their own home sorry michael i believe you 're about to say something um it 's it 's one of the hardest use cases for us uh as those where you can 't don 't have can 't charge at home i mean it 's obvious that if you can charge at home it 's a great benefit if that 's just not not possible it 's a harder one for us to crack um but it 's it 's one of those not the right words but chicken neck scenarios and when we get to that point where there 's a market for it that do cater for that you kind of see that in europe a little bit where the the um petrol station four courts are now being uh having uh electric charges in there in in their facilities and because there 's a market for it or you can see in some um parts of the country in the uk where they 've got charged bollards uh in their street because that 's probably how they charge because there 's a market for it so the kind of the unfortunate thing is you need the the people and the cars to build the market you need to charge infrastructure to support the people in the cars so we need to sort of get this flyer wheel moving somehow and that 's the the hardest cases in in that situation where um people can 't charge at home a lot of the time it 's not that much of an issue though um if you 've got a nissan leaf which has uh i think it 's 270 kilometers range the new ones that 's something like five days worth of driving to charge more than once a week so it 's basically you could go to a fast charger there are various fast charges around the place or you could just do your shopping at um say you do shopping twice a week pick a shopping center that has a charger and charge there whilst you 're shopping do that you know um yeah one of our members greg does that regularly uh chatswood westfield he 'll he can 't charge at home because the strider won 't let him uh so he 'll it goes up to westfield and charges there does his shopping goes home we did a presentation in the inner city i think it was around about glebe or something what was the suburb michael you were there uh in sorry sorry hills the ata i can 't remember it was but um there was a whole lot of uh charging infrastructure right around the place and everyone every second person was asking us how we could charge our car if we bought one because we live in an apartment it 's not that big a deal place you need to look on plug share find where they are and um just plan your plan plan it out it 's not that hard um yeah yeah absolutely and i think dew actually did ask this probably will be our last question but uh he asked did anyone mention plug share so can someone just give a really brief 30 seconds what is plug share how do you find it um because that 's a really great way it 's an see actually wow there are so many charges around even if you 're not aware of them if you look at the map you 'll notice that there are a lot around so that if you 're sitting in front of your computer if you 're sitting in front of your computer plugshare.com and you will find plug share there 's an app that you can put on your phone and there 's also a web page it shows you where all the charges are how they 're configured um even even has facility to see if they 're in use um but in fact alex brought it 's on if there 's a web there 's a web page and there 's an app for that yes absolutely alex did have a screenshot of that yeah there was i think just there 's this link on one of the slides to plug share well i think we 're we 're getting towards seven so we might wrap up now i 'd like to just end by thanking mark michael and alex thanks so much guys for your expertise and giving us your knowledge that was fantastic um for anyone who asked a question there were a lot of questions there i 'm sorry i didn 't get to all of them please feel free to email me if you have a council specific question or even for alex michael mark i can direct it onwards um and if you are interested in any of the resources that you saw tonight again email me i 'll get those out to you or do a bit of google homework and i think you 'll like what you find so thank you very much everyone i 'll just type you have any questions just grab that and feel free to exit as and when you like thank you very much thank you charlie thank you charlie thank you thank you alexa michael see you guys charlie you 're muted we can 't hear what you 're saying thanks mark that 's very helpful uh we 've still

    "text": "oh hey there you crafty hearty boogers i 'll be all hahaha that 'd be right it 'd be me captain luke and silly back for another heartless that would be good pal here wilson the first mate parrot yes we 'd be here to do some more drawing with you teach you the noble art of drawing so you can fill out your logbooks and stuff like that you don 't have to be good you just have to get a reasonable facsimile and that 's what we 're working on right showing you the basic tricks to be able to draw stuff that people go oh i can see that that was about all you can see this week that 's a treasure chest haha that 'd be right we 'd be growing a treasure chest that 's right a treasure chest we 're going to draw a prize for you all new for that and after it once we 've done it i 'll show you how we can turn that treasure chest into a little game that you play around the house when you 're all afternoon you can turn into a little priority game with your own little treasure chest ah it 'd be fun but right now i think it 's time for us to do a little north like a pirate and then we get down to drawing so put your hands on your hips put your head up and laugh proud cause that 'd be right it 'd be time to draw of our steer so we 're ready right we 're drawing a treasure chest just like this one here just like my little beauty here right you see the perspective of it there like that kind of stuff okay you open it up it 's gonna be treasure ah you know his treasure is empty pieces of eight a few bits of silver there earrings and all sorts of things right that 's it all right that 's what we 're drawing note the bands right that 's the important part the bands there they 're all together metal strips right that one 's gonna have rivets in it this one 's just uh fluorescent on some other way right 're going for see the little feet oh that we 'll draw a little feed on it as well lock and device all right that 's the kind of thing we 're gonna be drawing right now right so grab your pencils all right i 'm just going to draw it in black and white all right just with a lead pencil but you right once you 've drawn yours you can clear it all up right make it your own all right make it pretty do whatever all right remember this is your treasure chest you 're going to be hiding the treasure in it so you want to do it all right now just to make things simple but you do this on a separate page if you 're showing someone else you don 't really need to do it i 'm just up here i 'm going to draw what we 're going to do all right so we 're going to start drawing a cross line and a couple of diagonal noises like that all right we 're going to do them here in the middle the middle right so our first line goes across nice and even right that 's the width of that chest all right so however big you want to draw your chest however your paper is you 'll know it every now and then the table rocks all right it 's because we 're at sea or okay those people that sort of got a bit feisty saying that i know what you 're drawing it 's rolling around and all that well there 's not much i can do if a wave hits there 's a wave hits us and we roll with the waves that 's what called bean at sea all right that 's why people get sea sick all right so if you get seasick maybe you should be drawn with a bucket all right that 's all i 'm saying just have you got a bucket there it might be happy anyway anyway now enough of that right so we 've got our loin across that 's the top but you need sides don 't you soy so this is where our diagonally lines come in because that means it 's a big deep chest full of joy full of joy and treasure all right oh there he goes but they do have to match up all right so this one goes down sort of the same there right that okay and then you just draw across the bottom because that 's the bottom and we give us that remember we 've talked about the strap so we 're just going to give ourselves straps there so you want to make them the same sort of evenness right now next we 're going to draw some curves all right remember these curves all right these curves are going to be the top so we 're going to come a little bit off the back right because that 's perspective as you look back at it but we 'll end up pretty close to the front here like that right this is the outside curve so let 's go outside curve be it all right and now our band is just inside same sort of width all right of course you can make your bands as wide is easier to manage right that 's why i 'm doing it this way now we want two straight lines now two straight lines but the top one is gonna be longer than bottom one right they 're gonna be like that you 're gonna take the top one from here right and we 're going slightly back up but pretty much straightish right so we go all right there we go that 'll do us so this one comes back all right and you want this line here right see how that line is there you pretty much want that to be a similar sort of direction that way so if i bring that over a little bit and try to bisect the ends of both those lines and gives you the idea all right and then we can join that up the bottom and start to look more like a chest in it right sorry we 'll do our bends across there right we already got the band at the top all right there we go now next up what do we do next all right well we right pretty much parallel to this one right so this one if you go like that you can see which angle you want to do it right so you want this one to do and you might want to just go across there lightly like that right to make sure it 's what you wanted because we 've got to do a little curve right from there around the same way so you want to go that 's one way of doing it is if you trace your hand around it gives you the feel for it right so then when you start here you want to start here and go you try to do something similar right all right then we 're just joining that up and that gives us our top of our chest right chest top like that pretty good all right okay now this chest needs bands more bands on it right so inside that curve we do another one and we 'll do one on this side right for the lid and one in the middle all right so this needs another two curves and curves the more it looks like it 's all part of the same lid all right okey-dokey right now you 've done that remember this is going to be like a cartoon facility let 's draw in the rest of the bands all right so we go to here and we 're going to go all the way down that gives the band on that side all right and the middle band on that side right okay it 's all filling in and the same on this side all right start the tape shape now i reckon and another line going that way all right so now you 've got all your bonnet bands it all together right what the chest needs now i reckon some handles so how do we do handles again we go back to our curves right you 're gonna do two curves right one inside the other all right so we 'll start with the first one in the middle right so we just do it like a little smiley face and then we 'll go outside that and we do another smiley face all side of that band there right we 're going to do two more smiley faces but these ones we 're going to attach to here so you do one smiley face and then again this one i would do about the same as the bands all right around there a bigger smiley face all right getting there right so what 's next next we 're doing sort of loopy circles right so it 's almost a half circle so it 's going around and back again like that all right we 're doing it here so you get on the edge of the the line there right there flat bit and you do a loop all the way around all right and you see doing that gives us the bottom of our little handle right the little bottom part of our handle next up right over on here this is a lock right so what we do to draw the lock is we start with drawing a big black circle all right got the back circle there like that now you realize it 's a lock and that behind the 'll draw a couple of bands down there like that all right so that 's the rest you guys you know so also it gives us a shape so you can see the bands there is going to be that right up to the lock but the lock you have that bottom bit of the lock too so let 's draw in a little triangle here right just a little triangle looks like this you know it 's just a triangle and the circle 's going over it that 's all you 're really doing there and when you color it in what does it look like a log i reckon what do you reckon hey so you 've got your lock you 've got all your banding you 've got your handle it 's all going well really isn 't it okay but see this if we do little loops like that on here on the end of here right it just makes it look more realistic see here you go see that so it looks like it 's all part of the same unit then all right that give these a light shade so you could do this in a lighter color a silver color would be nice right because you know it makes it looks made out of silver or brass or that you can do that the same you do the bands like that you know i could be like super rough part of the padlock and all that kind of stuff right kind of thing you could do when you do it all right we 're gonna put feet on it now the feet are just going to be little lumpy bits like that all right so put a feed on each corner so there 's one right here 's another one that 's good and there look if you think the back corner is going to be there somewhere so the other foot it 's going to be like that let 's see now you can just see in the background but so we color those in dark our feet you can see that their feet right it 's only small because he 's at the back and that one bigger corner right you the perspective i 've got on this one you could probably get rid of that foot anyway but but you know it 's there at the moment and that 's what it 's all about right just getting it right as you feel what you want now what we can do is put little rivets on so rivets a bit some of these little screws except they 're actually permanent ones right you 've got two ends and when you bang one and it sticks them together like that or use a machine or it 's hot and all that sort of stuff so we and that 's if you look at a lot of those things that have been riveted on i got these little spots all right so we 're just going to draw our little spots on there right i 'm drawing them cool if you don 't have bigger holes you could actually draw little circles and color them in or you could get a different color pencil into them all right silver but so all around we 're doing these little rivets all right i one we prepared earlier all right i might even talk to you about the game where i 'm colored putting these rivets on there right just because you 'll get the idea about uh what we 're doing all right so once you 've uh done your treasure chest right and colored it all in noise all right this goes to show you 've got it right i 'm sure yours looks a lot prettier than mine i don 't think mine 's been overly successful but you know it 's doing the job right it 's looking like a treasure chest once you 're finished right and you 've colored all in you know i said these are jewels in it i you colored it all in right it 's all ready what you do is you cut it up right or you get your moment to add or somebody else can handle the scissors right don 't go running with scissors cutlasses are fine scissors not so good all right cutlasses are meant to be run with scissors not so much right when you 've done all these scissors and cut it out right cut it out and when you 've got yourself a colored little chest so you cut all the edges around so you just got the chest right and then what you do is you can take your chest and hide it somewhere in your room all right all around your house like under a mat or in the carpet on a cupboard or something like that and then you can make your very own treasure map to where your treasure is right you start your front door right and you can plot it out you draw in the landmarks like you know there 's auntie doris_._839.04 it looks like a bear you draw her in right you can do all that sort of stuff you know you 've got your room thing there you can draw your little map all right so there 's your door so you 've got door and you can go all right and you can do little things with pieces let 's throw that and then you turn and you do like a little compass right work out what so you 've got like that so you can put north on this way so you know that that sways north north facing backyard there all right and then you go there and you can go you know if you 've got the lounge chair like that lounge chair there you know you could draw in a lounge chair and say you 've got to go around the lounge chair and then back over you know you know under the dining room table right you know into the kitchen you know and there it is the treasure x marks the spot in a can of beans or something right that you know something like that you can do it but i mean that 's how you do it that 's a scribbly real thing as well going along but that 's the kind of idea i 'm just trying to make it so you got things you can understand with it but basically you cut it off color it in have it all ready and then hide it you got your own little treasure on in your own house keeping that 's it pretty good something bit of fun to do on a saturday or sunday afternoon when you know you got right sick of playing computer games or watching tv if that ever happens right now great so as you can see by my treasure up here you can see all right of course this is written material you can just go last longer your paper one but you can see right so i 've got the map here so you can follow it around if we start here when you come in and you follow the little track around see you see you go around passes some furniture there 's some pirate stuff there it will put your boat there that 's what i was doing passing there because this isn 't a big shady type place where we need this treasure right you follow the tracks around as you go so this is the kind of thing you 'll be drawing for you right there 's a little signal there you say oh there 's a big cross skull and crossbones there near the ships and dockers right past the dock call victoria very good very good all right now what 's next oh that was from an old battle there you can see the smokes there you follow that drop some captain chase oh look at that an xbox spot you see that right x marks the spark not that 's where the treasure is buried and that 's what you could do or say you could do that make your own little treasure map there right with your own home that way when you ride your little treasure chest that you did wherever that is wherever that x is and you can find it again or you can get somebody else to find it or you can get somebody else to hide it and give you a treasure map a great little game of hide and seek hide the treasure find a prize all that sort of stuff all right anyway right that 'd be it see here 's my little treasure chest right there it is all ready to go to play a treasure and right you 'd be all colored in and all and hide that anywhere like oh and he 's beats hard to see with a patreon right and then on my map i 'll have a big axe on top of the parrot all right that kind of thing easy fun little game you can play the whole family you can hide it then give somebody else to treasure map see if they can find it or vice versa you can get them to already do that so like oily go seek with treasure a boys that 's gotta be good in that that 's gotta be good all right so there it is treasure chest all right pretty quirky little cartoony treasure chest could be right off you know bill and sebastian those two you know that kind of stuff beauty and the beast that kind of stuff ha ha very good oh you think it 'd be dancing and singing there if it wasn 't like that anyway that be our drawing class for the afternoon i hope you had hours of fun chasing off to your treasure if not go back watch telly alright i 'll see you later bye _"

    "text": "oh my goodness i 'd be right we 're back for some more maybe we should start with some revision i mean it 's been more than fingers can count toes you got a peg leg that 's all your fingers and all your toes and your peg sixteen crazy right now let me do some revision what do we have to remember can you remember how to go r come on i think somebody over the back forgot to go oh hey captain let me hear it now oyoy captain that 's good captain right now give me an r r give me another r put them all together and they spell you guessed it good job right now how do we stand back apart all right maybe your legs are pot we 're on a ship we 're rocking with the ship that 's right don 't close together close together you up your tip over your legs are a pot so you 're going with the waves all right your feet are hanging onto the neck there right yeah that 's it you got it and your you laugh proud haha you got this i reckon you just about memorize this for now your port is your left even if you know your left and right now you know you 're porting to starboard you can learn the left and right balance from that that 's your port all right that 's you started remember same as this ship here right same as the old beach because we 're in the arbor here over that side support the port 's the side you load on starboard where the steering started on the steering mechanism when you had the old tiller there at the back and the old ones that 's where it was on the side of the ship they were viking ships because lots of stuff come from the vikings you know original pirates almost almost all right and remember up the front you got the bow all right or the four that 's why you call it the four masks and four sails top soils and stuff like that right and the art or the stern all right all right because it 's stern it 's the back oh right then that 's good that 's good talking about vikings ahoy you know he said ahoy and you hear that my party there it 's like a greeting isn 't it hello all right but that was a working word originally right it was a battle cry when they yelled ahoy that meant they were gonna go with their story to slit your thunder and stuff like that all right it got a bit you know softer over the time but that 's how it was ahoy that 's where it comes from so you learn something every day some days you 'll learn two things other days you probably sleep through most of the morning and you think oh that won 't bother us afternoon but right now we 're learning because we hear it fire let 's go give you an error ah you 're sticking you 're on your toes all right now what are we talking about ah we 're talking about the business of piranha and the articles right because basically poyerton is a business endeavor right not sailor in if you 've got problems with the old patch again here we go we 're here right to make money and we all want to make money everybody 's apart that 's why we 're sewing up to make money right we 're doing it together okay so to do this we had a few regulations right so we all knew that kind of so we were a bit of a democracy right all our decisions were made together so we voted on everything and we had these things these sort of regular rules that we all agreed to right so you 'd sign up to the articles right the articles right we made our decisions so it was benefit us all right what it 's like for economists those are studies students are economists out there right okay it was a bit like the invisible hook we were off there for our needs and once right so everybody would benefit we 'd make those choices and we 'd vote on everything right and so we 'd do that and we 'd sign the articles and the articles are our do right and you 'd follow those and if you didn 't you were punished by marooning or worse than that remember that 's why we put you on an island and we sail off when you stay there all right you 're stuck all right so that 's what yeah that kind of stuff and so what were they well rule one was that equal vote right everybody had a vote equal everybody 's vote was worth the same thing captain didn 't get an extra vote oh got an equal vote and you all got equal food right and basically an equal share of the loot except that a couple of special occasions a captain would get two shares right and the quartermaster and the salem master they get a share and a half right each because of the extra responsibilities they had right and that 's the benefit otherwise why would you be captain where you didn 't get the same thing otherwise and making all the choices and all that sort of stuff you know making all the decisions and plans that have to get approved really you know so you know what we do right is you get that little extra bonus there by being captain and you get to be in charge right you know some of us like to be in charge what can i say but basically it was one vote one person right very fair very fair right and rule two was if anybody right took more than their fair share that was it that was a really bad crime but you 'd be marooned for sure i just leave you in the island there you go you 're in maroon right rule number three was no cards or dice on board the ship right wouldn 't let you play cards and dice you could sing and all sorts of things like that but we didn 't want no gambling on ship right because that starts fighting and they will you know imagine if you were one of the crew you got your equal share right you 'll share and you just enjoyed yourself and then you go i 've had a few drinks right and a bit of party going enter the ship you 've got no money that guy over there 's got all the money you 're not going to be rattling with him right in fact you might not even defend him and help him out next time he 's in danger right because you think well if he 's gone i 'll get his share and he 'll come back into the pool and all that sort of stuff right so we 'll do that you know other thing about all those pirates right is not only do we have this right with the lists of all the rules we had a list of compensations right if you were injured right there was a rate would work out at the beginning of a cruise right how much you get paid if you lose your arm you got a hook and all that sort of stuff right you get through that or your leg or if you 're totally incapacitated and so all these little things like you had their own like insurance team right so if you were injured you 'd receive a payment for that as much money part as you would if you didn 't have enough legs and all that sort of stuff right so that 's how good we were and even right even leaving right you could share your money with your family and all that if you passed away on ship your money would go back to your family right so if you had a family back at home or you know was it there they would get your share of the treasure right it wouldn 't just get doing it up between us if you had all that glass off and your family could be like you know your family whether your wife and your kid and all that sort of stuff or it could be if you had a mate there you 'd be living it for a long time right they 'd still share it equally if they were living together all that time they would share that as they were a family unit because they 're living together and sharing their time right so that was very progressive people with pirates you know very progressive right one was all what i mean we 've been doing each time remember when i blow all the whistle right it 's lights out right at 8pm eight bells eight pm all right which is just the end right here the dog watch the end of the second dog watch is 8 p.m right when that goes all your lights and candles down below will go out right so people would sleep and all that kind of stuff that way you know one person up there being annoying and keeping everyone else awake and all that kind of stuff ever gets a decent sleep and again you 're not grumpy and you 're fighting and then you 're looking after each other you need your best for pirating okay very civil ways to raise sweet pirates right all right now once you 've got the lights the candles out next one is pistols and cutlasses right your pistols are cut this is right it 's your responsibility to keep them clean and sharp all right and you know sharp and clean so you needed to do that right then if any time because your weapons weren 't properly loaded after you 'd be in big trouble you 'd be punished somehow right probably clean out the builds for that one right you know down the bottom there where you crouch down and pumping out water and scraping it off and all that sort of stuff for her terrible job cleanup builds things like all heaven all right now all right the next one was that no man could actually bring a woman as a companion under the ship right we have women crew like aunt bonnie i told you all about her right they could join up and be part of the crew one for all for one right but nobody bring them on if they 've surplus their requirements right take up space cause fights all that kind of stuff and they 'll see this bad luck right but we use that women crew come on just to be crew right so you long as you hold your own weight do your job that 's all good right so if you want to be sorted out that 's fine ship right any person who deserves a this is listen we 're not seven right desserts a ship right during battle bang marooning all right leave the other one in no wires you 're there right and they 'll be also like there 's no fighting no fighting on the ship between shipmates right right you got a dispute you settled on land right but when we 're at sea all right we 're all together it 's one for all over one if you want to settle it offside you get there with your guns and your pistols and all that sort of stuff you have your jewels you have it out but that happens on land not at sea right again keeping things harmed when you swim around ship right and no person right when you 're sewing up we make it no person could leave the crew because you choose a little whenever you want but we made it no person could leave the crew until we shared at least a thousand pounds right at least with a thousand pounds shared then we were able to you till we got a decent about a little nest egg before we start dividing up alright so everyone got to share a lot of the money right well you didn 't kind of run off and get everything if everyone hadn 't got all that big share right and the final rule right rule 10 right very important rule rule 10 is that musicians musicians remember i told we have the ships musicians right very popular fellas right well we 'd give them sundays off right so that was the rule 10 sunday 's offer musicians because i told you we 're really really civil at least we follow all these rules right following all these rules man we get more money for many reasons one is we have less fights and less conflicts so we 're all working together for the same thing so if you know one benefits we 're all for benefits you know like you know more pay for more prey i like that expression that 's what you sort of call it right that and also you know it helped with our reputations right because types and their ships and all that if they knew we were predictable that we 'd have a code to work off right they knew they surrendered to us without a foreign right that we 'd look after them and that 'll be it you know and that wouldn 't mind so they 'd be more likely to surrender if they knew we were more predictable if you 're wild and crazy you gotta go he 's doing all sorts of random things well they 're gonna feel a bit if they know they 'll be punished if they point but be okay if they don 't they 're more likely just to surrender and say we 'll pay you a bounty and all that sort of stuff that was handy right other thing is we didn 't have any slaves right no slaves right all the black sailors where sailors remember the cruise and all that kind of stuff what are these races oh no slaves nobody can script it in everybody got to go vote because there 's no point having people that weren 't there to help negative right they 'd be looking to get off they wouldn 't be happy they wouldn 't work it hard but if we 're all members all getting a share we work hard together right that was a weird whole word no press cans for us right that 's how it all is everyone would volunteer to join and sign up occasionally you might have to convince a sailing master or a doctor or a surgeon or something like that because we really need their skills you know but we could be right persuasive and eventually they would join on and everyone knows after a while if they get the prophets and share it it was a good luck to be home and they 'd get in there and do it right and eventually they just enjoy and then you know joey go in give me another r r and then that enjoy going put them all together and they go because you know it 's good fun all right so that 's why they do that so that 's how we do it equal pay and all that kind idea of how it worked yeah amongst the crew and now we all get together and work for the same common good following the invisible hook economist you 'll love that all right so i 'm thinking of julie maslow the swedish baker who said needing or something you do to bread hierarchy of needs all that sort of stuff but you know i digress into economics that probably you know put small children to sleep and old children and middle-aged children and old people and young people and other mates and it 's not false asleep as well all right okay scuttlebutt i 'm going to tell you two things now right what we 're doing communication right communication economics is all about communications i 'm sure i don 't know they never communicated that to me anyway scuttlebutt you 're a scuttlebutt you know and tell the rumor oh it 's a skull but you heard that expression oh that again comes with the ship all right comes from the ship scuttlebutt what scuttle is right a scuttle is a hole you put in a ship right you a hole in underneath fills with water and it sinks right so with a hole they put in is called a scuttle and a bird right a bird is about what they call the barrels right we kept the water in on shipwreck all the birds right and so a scuttlebutt is the hole they used to have in those barrels right that had a plug in it and you pull the plug out or you have a little doozy there with a turnable tappy type set up there right that you turn open and fill up your glass or water and have a drink right and so that 's where the crew would go and have a drink or water right that kind of stuff and that around without that that 's when they 'd gossip and a lot of the rumors and stuff on a ship would start around the water barrel same as you have that thing now they talk about the uh the water things and offices and all that where they do that whatever you call those little things water tank things they have in there with the scuttlebutt and that 's where this little boat comes from all right it 's actually the barrels but the water came in on the ships that 's what scalable was about and the other one was chewing the fat you heard about chewing the fat of you all right let 's go out and chew the fat it 's like talk about stuff you know i 'll sit around and chat for ages and it 's really about talking for a long time and just sharing things and talking well chewing the fat actually comes from you remember when we did the cooking melon right remember we talked about cooking right we talked about the funny they used to salt the beef so it 'd last forever and ever and ever basically every year 's worth of beef there you know it 's got so hard we could make belt buckles out of it but remember i told you all about that right i will that 's what it is chew in the fat that stuff would be so hard right the sailors would end up chewing standing around talking to each other trying to forget how to better tasted and all that kind of stuff and i 'll be chewing away and i 'd be talking and look like you know when you move the bounce moving when you 're touring all the time looks like you talk but anyway so that 's where chewing the fat comes from right like talking on for ages so another those famous expressions that we all sort of know what we 've heard of or our parents have heard of or you know the auntie doris has heard all right chewing the fat and that comes from the sea all right so all these things all these exciting things come to you from your good mates the pirates and we all sailors here on the good ship beatrice right so i think we 'd be going to the end of our articles one right so next week next week we 're talking episode 17 17. i 've got something harassing lined up to do 17 right get me right off the top of everything oh i know i 'm actually how to do that what strokes you use all that kind of stuff you know we already had one where we talked about the cutlass but i 'm going to go into more detail on actual fighting techniques with the cutlass and i might even depending on how the time goes do a little bit of work with you right a little bit of work right on some naval tactics with actually the ships how you move around or what is which we should do you know but we 'll see how that goes with it a bit later on and all that kind of stuff just see how the time rights along right because we don 't go too long of these things or too short so we 'll work it out we 'll see how long the cut this thing takes you know you know do some slashing and some other cutting and all sorts of flat so we 'll bring out the colors all right it 's just over there i didn 't bring it on today because i thought you know it 's gonna feature this time anyway that be the story i think we 'll be about finished right so i think it 's just one more time we could stand there and laugh like a part are you ready [Laughter] all right and you know the lesson right number four rule number four means what at 8 pm all lights are going out and we 're trying for sleep but for now i 'm going to pipe us all down anyway and you can just imagine this is it 8 o 'clock or you could play it just before 8 o 'clock if that 's when you 're going to bend because stole you kept on looking silly just telling you it is time that we went down to the decks there all right down to the main deck there are you ready a we 'll be seeing you next week _"

    "text": "[Music] i 'll have to be taking other people 's toes and counting them right so lesson 17 we 've got lots of fun things to cover this time we active jumping about doing all sorts of things and scared the parents that 'd be right so give me an r r give me another r r put them all together and these though that right let 's get in the mood for some serious piranha because today we 're going to cover the colors i know i touched on it before but i 'm going to get into detail about the use and like i told you i was easy to learn so i 'm going to teach you some other stuff right first i want to talk about a few different words again right we 've been talking about words and stuff like that so get a bit of the left side and the right to tell your brain working right they had both sides of your brain working at the same time thinking and doing oh all sorts of crazy things like that good for pirates to 's how we become an all well-rounded pirate like me well-rounded wait i don 't think we 've done it yet come on stand and laugh like a bird decide head to the side and laugh that 's it be proud right now what words were you gonna do fathom was one of the words you 're that i don 't think i could found this it means work things out right you know we don 't have a fathom wow wow that originally was a measurement remember you 're the old feet and inches some people still call things feet dentures your cat does it sometimes as well right well measurements right they used to be done on body parts right and so feet you know feet also they went for average sizes so 12 inches right is what a foot was which is about 30 centimeters now right that 's about the average size of man 's foot at the top right when they decided that so that became a foot makes sense to that right well the fathom right is the average size of man from the that right so the tip of my fingers that dip my fingers over there supposed to be about six feet right and that 's how the measure so fathom was six feet right and that 's how they worked it all out right all those kind of things they used to do to work out the distances right and so a fathom became because it was not a small distance but it was a long distance so father was what they used a lot of the time to work somebody 's measure out and work out what they were doing and all that kind of stuff so the feather was a really popular thing so it 's over time it developed into oh can you fathom it as in can you work it out or well yeah how far it is you know that 's how fathoming became the word right does things have changed after the world after a while now the other word i wanted to talk to about was mayday you heard that oh wait a minute we 're sinking zinc or that kind of thing great it people sing more than me people with birthdays of me a little like the universe fall into the water and go oh i made a baby no no actually it 'd be a french word maydays right it 's like m apostrophe a-i-d-e-z or something like that there was french like throwing sets all over the place right but maydays means help me in french and of course anglicized everything as we do it became my day because it was the closest scene like that and that 's where mayday comes from it was basically a french word kind of mashed up right a bit like portal you know the portals here portals like the little windows on ships and all that kind of stuff right there called the portholes well originally right they were you know i got my guns in there you can 't see it right because there 's little doors there right you 've got little doors in there that 's for two reasons one reason when you 're in port like this people can 't see how many cannons you got right and otherwise got these open windows where the guns are they 'll fill up with water right and you have all sorts of issues but when you have little doors you 'd seal them on that would keep them shut right and they would look called portals and eventually they came to all the sort of doors and windows and they became portals on ships and all that kind of stuff but the french word for door is porte p o rte all right eventually they just got rid of the eu in port so portholes it 's just those holes in the ship we do that right another french word right now the last word i want to cover right is a bit of a weird one because you know on the facebook we 're doing that kind of stuff somebody posted thing there that was supposed to be shakespeare right and he was apologizing he was apologizing for to all those hsc students out there they 're about to study him and he was apologizing to saying it wasn 't his fault and he called them for doctors and i 'd be a swearer right it ain 't me a fox right okay i want you to know because i don 't want to get the wrong information from people like fake shakespeare 's what these things are a follow-up remember i was saying about you 've got the rib right around the peel there right there big long one and you 've got those arms that go up each side and then the planks go on i 'm saying that the other week we 're talking about the ships the planks get down into it but you 've got like the ribs of the ship right those ribs do what the name for them is you guessed it photox that 's what foxes are they 're the rims like that it 's what it means the actual original word came from like foot hulk so because they come up from the bottom and the hook around right and that 's where the name come from but that 's what it was the fox was a foot hook right and that was a viking word all right i have it 're not deceived i just want you all to know that all right ain 't no swear word it just means the ribs of a ship the forex all right all right good now the colors why the colors you know i 'm an enthusiast of the colors why you say why are you so enthusiastic about the cutlass well i think i 'll tell you the story of me dear old captain when i was just a lad lord had to be a party when i was just a wee little father weird and about the parrot sorry i was there all right and i was there my captain right he 's busy shopping his blade shopping and making it really sharp he just kept on and on doing it every time you see me you show up i said to him captain captain why he spent so much time with the blade shopping it up he said because it 's my lifesaver it looks after me i look after it all right that 's what a good part does i said but surely in these days of pistols and shoot them you know what i told you i 'll carry a couple pistols right you know surely that 's better than a cutlass because he can do it from a distance he said ha when you run out of shells or when the gunpowder gets affected by the damp and the sea and all that kind of stuff what are you going to rely on and then without emotes do it you whipped out his cutlass and he brought it right up to me nose centimeters away and i looked at it just like you 're looking now and i thought oh that 's a good point he 's got a zomboy but i didn 't that 's your cut i see that the cutlass and you saw how quick it is to bring out right that 's one of the advantages of a cutlass right if you had a longer sword than this right it 'd take you longer to draw out naturally a cutlass it 's easy to draw out plus we 're in a ship all right so my roof is low here right if gonna catch in the roof that 's it 's got a bit of length but it curves it 's not short it 's also it 's a good strong blade right so you can cut your ropes right that you cut wood with it you do all sorts of stuff like emergency ropes somebody get a foot caught a rope and they 're flowing off all the resistance you slash it down all those kind of things right and short enough like if we were up close fighting like that kind of stuff i could still just put my arm back and i still get the points right in front of you right so it 's still there threatening and with the long blade it 'd go past you or left up my hand back like that be all uncomfortable but right there is all sort of close you see that see that right close there just the elbow behind there right i 'm sitting right up close all right that 's how it is now let 's have a look at the blade right now so it 's sharp of this anyone there 's a little bit of blunder right here and totally flat there because that 's going to take a lot of the blows and you want to be a sharp edge blowing there because it 'll start chipping on you but it cannot work you know weak in your blades you don 't want to be weakening your blades do you in the back right that 's flat all the way again because you 'll be blocking a lot with that user it just means it 's stronger at the back right but you 're sharpening up the point here right that bit there 's short because you want it so you can do a little backwards strokes and helps do more damage or sharp both sides here so we have that bit of sharp sharp but it 's still a little bit thick i don 't know that right kind of stuff and it goes all the way up to your hilt right so your hilt has a basket on it right basket right okay which protects your hand it 's like a shield you it 's your shield right it 's protecting you all the way right protects your hands from getting damaged and all that sort of stuff plus you can use it as a weapon you can punch with it right but in the this bit here it 's nice and heavy you can use that to put down somebody 's head or butt dumbbell or even nailing the nail or something something 's going to loosen the old ship you want to nail it back you can do the end of that crack so i had multiple uses right so it 's a handy handy weapon to have right but that 'll be the old one right now now first up so it 's handy for up close right that 's the whole thing you 've always about it right so first up i 'm going to talk about your feet all right you can 't really see my feet so i 'll have to talk you through this right so your feet are like basically you remember we 're on a ship so a rocket you see me rocking all we 're rocking now you see like what are you always swearing about it 's cause we 're on the boat remember okay okay but so you want your feet apart right but in this case because we 're sword fighting right you want one foot behind the other but about so my left foot right all right because i 'm right-handed it 's pointed out that way right back my right foot foot is pointed away where i want to go right it 's pointed up towards your right hand so that 's where i 'm going so i 'm tilted slightly so i 'm offering less of a profile right if you 're like that you 're offered a wide target ear smaller target and i 've got more likely protect with my shoe you 're very excited standing like that right and how far apart are your feet right well basically sort of shoulder width apart but you want it to be like a normal piece like a normal piece because you want to be balanced right so you want to be balanced so you can move forward like that right so you can do that and if your feet are that normal though you know that 's how we do it and then if you do a lunge you 're taking basically two steps forward to push to go farther across right but that 's how you are that 's where your feet are right so they 're there you 're balanced nice and easy that 's the light not weight on either one you just stay like that and the other thing right with your feet and your movement right is when you 're attacking right now okay when you 're stashing down right that kind of stuff you follow the blade right you move with the blade right if i slash like that look at this whole side of my body you can see it right it 's all open all right you could probably get your blade around or somebody else could come over that but if i move with the blade so i 'm there you see the blade is protecting me right because i 've moved in behind the blade so as you swing it right that 's in your footwork right because then you 're ready to react to something else that happens because you 've moved in and the blade 's there so if i 've gotta go on a round like would you do that again right if i swung right he 's got that and he brings his way around i can go but and i 've still moved around and i 've moved right but if i 'm still standing in one place being static you know you 're not giving a move and target you want to do that right okay so the basic slashes right we 're just giving you a basic course because remember i tell you the other class good thing about customers easy to learn right so they 're just basic slashes you got to do right the prime one is the one we just did right right so that 's the diagonal slash right from up upward diagonal right you got the straight down the vertical right you 've got the horizontal you 've got the upward diagonal and you okay and you can do those down from the other sides all right from both sides and that 's your cuts there are your basic cuts you 'll do right now you don 't want to be doing big swingy things like that you know you see those ones where they built the big swing and they 're going to swing all that way up there like that you don 't want to be doing that because look my sword 's up there these swords here i 've been in trouble all right so we 're doing it quick so how you do that is all about the grip right we talk about the grip you don 't want to be holding it like a club are you going to you know that kind of stuff like that you want the clip loose and flexible a bit you know you want to be strong enough to hold it but you want it so it 'll conflict forward like that because that 's where you get your speed from having that right flexible grip you can flick it around and you all right not tight like that but i loose it down you know firm enough to hold up there all right and your poles again right we 're tilted back so we 've got all that there and so defensively right when i 'm defending with it i don 't want to be pushing the blades away like if somebody 's coming for me like that i don 't want to be pushing them right away you see that sometime in the movies like push it right away like that because look it makes my arm weak so if i get pushed down like that kind of stuff like that but also i 'm opening myself up right so all you 're really doing all right same thing i will say if i push it right away i 'm opening myself up and my arm 's weak that way all right so what i 'm doing is i 'm keeping it closed and all i 'm doing is deflecting everywhere from my body right so the sword comes across i push to there right then i 'm in attack again around down that kind of stuff right it 's only slight movement you don 't want to use too much movements here because it 's all about speed and being there quick right that 's what you do keep it close keep it fast all right now we 're pirates okay we 're hit and run we go in we 're all about speed getting in getting out getting it all done quick all right so don 't do these big wild things like that all right and when you do what i 'm talking about defending right there 's five basic spaces of defending as well so first position i put the sword back in the hilt right and my scabbard right i put the forward back on the scabbard because the first one is basically straight out of the scapula so you got that be your first defensive position right that 's one that 's two right that 's three that 's four and that 's for you so if we were doing out training we 'd be calling out those numbers and if we do it i your training all that kind of stuff like that but they 're the basic ones right and again you 're keeping it you 're not putting it right up there you keep it just there so you 're stopping the ball the blade really do that and also you see my arm right you 're making that little shape right you 're keeping the arm in tight like that and keeping the blade pretty much annoying with that because that 's the strongest part of your body right there one of the strongest parts of your body right so you want that gives you that sort of harder grip on it right further it like that you 're going to get pushed back but when it 's up close like that you 've got that whole frame straight i mean basically your whole frame is giving you strength right so you 're not relying on your muscles because you 're gonna hold this thought you know if you 're fighting for an hour or something like that and the sword being light you can do that and keep going but and keep it tight so everything like that every advantage you can give yourself that 's what you want to do all right so that 's the basics of defending and attacking what else we got to do there close by oh right the other thing right besides all that right the other advantage is you 're trying to capture the blade right if you can capture their blade in there like that all right when they clash together you want to catch their blade into that because then you can control it right you do that and slash down or right you can pivot off that bang hit them with that pit or even go down and then pull it down across their chest or something like that into the slash right so that 's part of the moves and the tactics you do by using the natural advantages of this blade right there the old cutlass so you keep it strong right no big movements catch and control slash be quick that 's what it 's all about right okay and the other thing you 've got one using the cutlass for the old battles right is you know a lot of people on these naval battles right you know some of them aren 't prepared like we 've taken over their ships and although it actually voiders and stuff like that so they 're making they 're picking up makeshift weapons you know what i told them about the belaying pins you know they 're all blowing pins right so they 've got them there 's like ammos and they 've got picks and all sorts of things they pick up and they start doing that but they always be short weapons right so if they 're short then you can just frost right just the thrust in and that kind of stuff where they come up right that kind of stuff keeps that vent but again you 're not lifting up they 're losing your advantage right your advantage is to keep it all in tight and you can do that and also right you 've got your other hand free right so if you 're holding up with the things you can reach in and under the chin you know all sorts of things like that all right so you 've got all that stuff there that you can do with the old cutlass somewhere it 's such a good weapon right your purpose now now i 've told you all about that kind of stuff right and i mean if you 're going to be doing this kind of might be talking to your dad or you tell you more i guess or your dad mostly i think and uh getting to do it with you right me and my young fellow we used to while we were inventing all these in england we had sword fights up and down all of these castles and all sorts of things there we were fighting all over the place we were ah it 'd be a great one all right but that 's what you learned a bit few tricks so next time you have a bit of a wrestle with dad and so for that you know a few things to do use your cutlass all right all right now i 'm gonna finish with of things that could happen when you 've got the sign so just one last story so there were these old two or five or three oh wow three pirates here they 're all sitting around having a room and having a chat and have chicken wang you know the old chewing the fat and all that sort of sorry and they 're all sitting there happy as larry i 'm mad until one of them goes ha you know i 'm the best with the cutlass in the whole world and they went rubbish rubbish without a drop he left to his feet and slashed and cut a floor a floyd until he went in off straight through one slash whoosh it was amazing he was so quick the other guys went oh no no no let 's take a look at somebody oh he 's better than you and he goes slash slash all right what happened two quick swishers and he cut the floor you know the floyd in four that 's right swoosh was four bits just lying there it was amazing i 'm like the have been right gets up and says here hold me wrong ha ha hello and he gets up and he goes slush and the flowy just kept on going awful the others are there laughing good [Music] [Laughter] that 'd be right i 'm pirates in their stories [Laughter] all right now give me an r give me another r r put them all together [Laughter] we already are the end of this lesson now i think that 'd be the end of the lesson but next week i might be telling you some stories about blackboard i think or maybe even i 'll tell you about the old diamond theft but at one time one of the stories hello pirates there but all sorts of things because if we listen to number eighteen one eight the rest went hungry oh it 's all happening eighty i don 't believe it we 'll get seventeen on the way first all right but we 're finishing up i think that 's about it we 've done all the damage again with our cutlasses all right hopefully most of the paint is good to be down here down in the hole with just me and me with my mr wilson over there but for now i 'm gonna whistle us all down so you can go home go to bed and dream of pirates and south seas oh nice there my friends extra love just for the editor see ya _"

    "text": "hello everyone dr hubbell back with you again and today i 'd like to talk to you a little bit about gases that are inside bubbles usually the gas inside a bubble is just the air that we breathe but if we put different gases in we can make bubbles behave in different ways so some gases are heavier than air and what that will mean is that when you make the bubbles they 'll just go straight down straight down like that every time just falling to the ground very quickly and some bubbles are lighter than air and so what that means is when you make the bubble it will go straight upwards [Music] away they go almost quicker than the eye can see straight upwards so when we combine those gases with air we can make some very beautiful tricks and right now i 'd like to show you a couple of those beautiful beautiful tricks as well yes so something like that is incredibly beautiful and now i 'd like to show you probably the most difficult bubble that i 've ever done up you go bubble there is called the double carousel helium tower it 's one of the most beautiful bubbles that i 've ever seen and i 'm proud to show it to you so thanks very much for watching my name 's dr hubbell i love bubbles and i hope you do too thanks very much everybody bye for now _"

    "text": "[Music] of our spare shipmates captain looking silly and i 'll be back for another episode of boy kitchen rules the seas that be right dear asked and he managed to get himself washed overboard so i 've taken a tiller until we managed to change my replacement so we 'll be looking out for one i wrote me a good mate over here the first mate wilson the parrot to help us out he 'll be my chef if you like but now i was thinking last time weird fish right so what 's the natural progression from fish chicken ah that 'd be right because chicken bee the fish of the sky it 's true it 's true they 're the same neither of them can really fly they both sort of jump and glide a bit right so that 's why chicken is the fish in the sky so i 'm going to take home q and a chicken dish here for us to celebrate another day together here on the good ship beaches right so what do we need well we need our cooking implements of most importantly all we need our colors that 's all you really need to cook with in it right okay there it is now you 've got your chicken we have your chicken but you got some veggies with this dishes right all right because it 's what we 're cooking is uh smoky chicken right the fish of the sea the sky fish of the sky smoking chicken with uh roast veggies and couscous all right so it 's just an interesting dish we 're gonna try but first the carrots right carrots we 've got the carrots right with the carrots we want them cut pretty foreign right finely cut carrots so they 'll bake up nice and toasty right so we cut her up so yeah nice and forward right noise and falling so that 'd be it all right so as you can see nice and fine all right that way they all cook quick quite eventually it 's pretty fine and stuff like that cooks a lot quicker right so it all comes together because couscous aren 't too long to cook it 's just fine beautiful now we 'll stick that on me silver plate got a couple little plates here right stick that on there right keep our veggies there together so i 'll be all ready we 're ready to bake them right lovely noise all right next so next up is the zucchini right a zucchini so the zucchinis right we 'll do them about one centimeter right so about that far one centimeter we 'll just cut off there so we cut off the end so get rid of the end because that 's not that tasty right and then we cut it off about one centimeter all right so we chop that up there you go more or less we 're looking at here you know about a centimeter width right pretty much how you want them again centimeter or this fine carrots book bake about the same time right so we 'll be nice and crispy all at the same time good job i 'll put them on my plate so ready excellent make sure you wash your ends of course right we got all our ones in tomato until you make sure right when you 're cutting up your tomato that your cutlets is good and sharp all right you gotta hold that edge otherwise if you eat it with a bun you hit a tomato with a blunt cutlass you 'll get squared in the oil because you know naturally a blunt cutlass that is the natural enemy of a tomato that 's what i hear anyway and uh that 's also how i lost my eye so you know when you 're doing the tomato right make sure your cutless is good and sharp because then you 'll be able to cut it into three centimeter chunks is what we want with these ones right real quick like all right so just a quick with your cutlass are you ready all right here we go got the blinder they look all right are they hey so see as you can see carefully by jumping backwards and fours up we did draw that get some decent sort of chunks there right now yeah that 'll you know bake up noise as well be nice and crispy do nice chunky sauces like that all right tasty you can sit your teeth into it little bits of tomato can run down your chin you gotta love daddy lovely right especially when i don 't square you in the eyes beautiful next up we got lemon right now the lemon right there 's two things we 're going to do with the lemon right we 're going to use both parts of the lemon the insides and the outsides everything 's got two parts insides and outsides that 's what the catalyst is for discover the insides of things that you know the outsides of haha but right so the outside of the lemon right is called the zest right you can zest it right so what you do is you take the skin off right with me using my colors means rubbing it backwards and forth real quick right to get the skin to come off all right here we go here we go all right that 's probably enough right you see that takes the skin off all right and that gives you the zest right because powder i guess which is basically just the skin you can see it 's come off there and that there too right and then our peanut c the lemon just rolled off all right just talk amongst yourself for a second like that you know you hit a wave something rolls off the table it 's a bit of a problem when you 're at sea cooking but i 'll just go get a lemon and i 'll be back now i 'm thinking they might have edited that bit out now so i 've jumped back in but here it is the lemon just a few splinters right so we 'll cut that off for now and we 'll use a juice later right so we just give it a good cut wow as easy nicely cut and two arrows right see that note two noise now we 'll just stick that on the plate with our zest yeah nice foreign zest there put that there so they 're there together to use the tin plate to store things on so we go to the stove and stuff like okay right and now we 'll use that for later for juice all right those two hours all right now what we need now is just the greeneries right all we got to add now is the garlic and the greenery so we need clean greeny garlic to taste you know i eat a lot of garlic crates so i have like four or five of these little lighters right what you do with them is you peel them and then cut them fine now the easiest way to peel a piece of garlic right is actually to squash it with your blade right squash it with your blade it 's like still long all right so when it 's squashed right you squashed it skin just comes straight off right just peel straight off real easy like okay that gives you see just came off straight off nice and easy and then you can just use the blade there to finally slice it beautiful finely sliced all right there it is all finally cut great just one last go so you can see it up close how that works see that crush that with your blade skin right this peels right off dead easy pretty easy right comes right off there like that quickest way to peel garlic right beautiful now we got some parsley right for decoration afterwards right there freshly picked off the boat here off the edge of the boat past it grows anywhere it 's easy to grow so we cut that roughly up cuff that up all right good rough cut there that 's your parsley roughly cut up right so just move that to the side of the breadboard and now final thing that we 're gonna cut up all right before we get sick into the serious preparation james right is i keep this stuff in bags right i keep my greens and stuff in the bags because they tend to sweat a bit don 't they you find they sweat a bit when you got them there so you 've got a canvas bag like this right have a calico bag you know that soft caligo bag like that right get some dry keeps them fresh longer right so it 's 've got here is baby spinach all right baby experience is a lovely thing to stir through things and all that kind of stuff it 's good with eggs for all sorts of things right so get out all that looks like that we rough cut it up all right your skin is just roughly cut because it actually shrinks away to a fair bit that way so you just got to give a few cuts see as you can see you may pretty rough the old baby spinach right no baby anymore right you have to worry about that don 't have to hurt its feelings just chop her up just roughly because it shrinks down a bit right down to that you 've got that there like that and that 's pretty much it right now i think we 're just about ready for some serious preparation so wilson do you want to go turn on the oven and we 'll get started on the last bits right there sounds good chicken the fish of the sky right here we are in the old mr awareness bowl again the chicken ready right it 's time to get the chicken ready right so you first up this brick freaker that 's his red stuff here paprika right smoky paprika is what i 'm using it 's about a tablespoon worth right remember for keeper cake paprika paprika is hard to say he is a pirate but beaker right is hot right it 's actually uh dried out capsicum right from north and south america there on top of america 's around mexico and all those sort of places they 're up and running around the caribbean it 's actually droids it 's actually quite spicy so you want to you know do it to taste a bit there like that right and to counter that right what we 've got is about the same amount of brown sugar right that takes a bit of the heat out of it as well just get a hot and cold and sweet sort of flavors together right now we need some hot pepper right remember if those are your last time know that you know i use pepper grounds and you crush uh cutlass right so we throw in some pepper all right i use rock salt right it 's all right it 's already been crushed there with me filled there i just had that there right it 's a little bit of salt right all right so now remember those lemons right the half lemons we had right you got half lemony right a lemon there right a bit of a squeeze it 's all right and next up we 're going to add a bit of lemon juice right so give it a bit of a squeeze next up we 're going to give lemon juice a bit of a squeeze right that 's it all right so you squeeze the whole thing out there right now as much as it can that 's good and the penultimate thing is your ad right we go back to our whale oil or you know olive oil if you use olive oil but you know you beat our cheese dried easy whale oil not politically correct you know a good dash of olive oil there right mix that in because next your chicken breasts right good old chicken breasts right here they are ripe chicken breasts you love them like that right so what we do is now we coat this and let it sit right so there 's a breast it 's sitting there like that right get all of them in there i 've got four loads you want there right let 's get it all in there again this is why we wash our hands because you know pirate and be a business of cleanliness cleanliness is next to captain lane this that 's what i always say before i 'm struck down by lightning which is happening more than once although you know right now we just sit that aside right let it just sort of soak in the juice right now you remember our trick with the veggies right all right we put all the veggies into the bowl there like that get our oil oil right let me throw in some pepper little bit of salt more pepper than salt right mix it up so it 's all nice and coated savory them up all into your baking dish right once it 's in your baking dish right then you put on for about 20 25 minutes at about a medium egg you know about 2 30 again that kind of eat right it usually does veggies pretty good for about 20 25 minutes right so put that in your pan and they 'll be baking away as you get the rest of stuff ready all works out so it 's all cooked the same time pretty tricky right right as our pan heats up i 'm gonna add a bit of the oil oil right just so again we don 't stick all right it 's pretty good on this one bit squeeze that out of the old wing glass right here loyal what we 're gonna do right with the chicken first up right it 's just brownie right just brown the sides of it right so before we bake it i want to make it nice and brown on the outside make it worth cooking again these are sizable pieces so i might have to do them two at a time i get that started and i 'll show you just flipping it over what it looks like and then we 'll go to the next stage i think otherwise you 'll be here all night you know you get really hungry as you can see right nicely browned up right i 'll keep all that flavor in i 've got it in a bacon dish with some bacon paper right that beaver there just got it from sticking down to the old pan alright that kind of stuff like that right somebody don 't do it at a time but it looks like this because i end up being too big for what my little oven i 've got here on the ship finish if you don 't have a real big one there whether i use a pot belly over there do that stuff but i 'm just cooking this for me and the old doctor really all right so there we go so pop that in the oven right same oven 's already up there for 2 30 all right going along with the veggies on it i 'll as we get the couscous ready all right right now it 's be time for the couscous all right all right now couscous let 's put in a bit of butter first right just to melt the pan right get it melted that birthright get that going and that melting you 're gonna stir in your garlic now of course gooseberry it 'd be you see i did like a lot of garlic right all right of course cooking actually during wheat the rough bits of dairy a week when they critical at the west they count when they grind it down it 's a bit left and they roll them up in the balls that 's what they made couscous get out of right cleverly those north african pirates those guys they did that right make it interesting so they use up all the bits of plant right so the bits it wasn 't fine enough to be floured and made and bread and stuff they rolled up that 'd be couscous right now couscous you wait that 's a bit fragrant right go about you know about a that all right all right you see that nicely like that now yeah a chicken stock cube right sounds like cruel to me to be squashing the poor little chicken into a cube that 's what they do some of these pirates i guess these chicken might have tried to escape without permission right that 's the punishment you know they could have marooned them could have killed all of them give them the cat annoying tails get the whip but no they made a cube out of them right now the old couscous works in pretty good proportions right you want to make it accurate right see you 've got a cup and a half of fluid all right to a cup of couscous right that 's our goals right basically one and a half you know you 'll have whatever proportions you want basically you could go for one and a half order to couscous right so we just do that so you stir that in so it 's gonna be nicely like that right just go for a little bit wait so let 's combine now we you want to do is i was working with a lid right you put your lid on you take it from the heat right and let the couscous absorb the water right take about five minutes so you leave that for five minutes now off the heat right so i 'm gonna take that off the heat and we 'll go from there right right what we 've got here right so we 're making our little sort of topping that we have on it right this would be greek yogurt right greek yogurt i 'm gonna drink a fair bit of topping cause we 've got a lot of chicken there right and a lot of salad and stuff from the couscous veggies enjoy that a great yogurt right anyway they strained it out you get the way out they straight away now you know a little miss muffin your curds and whey all right and that 's all part of it right well they strain out the way and that makes it thicker right that makes greek yogurt it 's like natural greek yogurt from the cow we and with the crew and the other animals we keep right now to this right we had a little bit of salt and pepper just a pinch right just pinch of salt and pepper right because you know what 's cooking without salt and pepper you always say ask yourself right plus we still got this half lemon right so we 're going to squeeze that in right squeeze that in so that got in all right there we go you mix that round and that be a lemon yogurt peppery thing all right that 's going to be real dang tasty on top right so we just mix it all in lovely job with the old spoon all right there it is put that aside until you 're ready to serve up for as they say in the business plate and up hmm gotta love that spillage there eh all right because straight you fluff it up with your fork right yeah lemon zest you 're wondering what we 're gonna do with that there it is the lemon zest right there right cut that in there right it there there 's more i reckon right now we 've got all this lovely stuff so we throw in all that baby there bit of a pinch of uh parsley right a bit more flavor right mixing all that in all right getting your wooden spoon a bit easier to move that all around have gone a bit overboard there with the uh ah all right a little crush down because what we 're gonna add next right are your vegetables right once you add those veggies right that will make all the difference all right so there you go here 's your veggies coming in i heat up the veggies right nice and brown crispy and peppery nice and cooked there now we cut back in now all right there we go anyway i don 't want veggies [Music] there you mix up the veggies and the couscous well look at all that color it 's beautiful all right okay it 's time to plate one up what do you reckon okay so all right look at the meat on there in the pan you 'll have a bit on that over the chicken right just give it that succulent taste all right let 's do that just before right yeah you 're dressing beautiful so here you go plenty of veggies and couscous they 're all there nicely right slice your chicken the breast being cut nicely there nice little thick pieces like that we get our topping yeah it 'll top them there like that looking quite stylish [Music] whoops probably should have left that alone but you know you get the pitcher you get a little bit of parsley that 's on the top as a garnish all right again i 'm a pirate so you know a little slap dash there but there it is look at that lovely you 've got to be happy with that don 't you right a lovely little dish there chicken smoky chicken the fish of the sky haha there it is smoky chicken the fish of the sky all there for you with veggies and couscous lovely lovely little sauce

    "text": "hi there antlers and land lovers hi how will you be and you 're all mate captain looking silly here i 'd be here at night pills in the earth noon on a saturday why is it because i 'm gonna give you some art tips and you might say the same thing i can 't draw a captain again drawer well what this class is about right he 's giving me a few little tips right because you know being captain i need to be able to draw a bit so i could draw landmarks and such in the log right so we recorded some people going past they 'll know oh that bad bear it looks like a rock looks like this bear it looks like a rock here we need a bit of turret here otherwise we 're gonna run a little reef and stuff like that so that 's how we did at the log so you gotta be able to get some basics here some people are naturals that i can draw up big ships like this and all sorts of things but me i i found if you break it down in this little composite parts just a little bit like if you do some lines and some curves and some of that you can put it together there 's a picture right make your own little picture so i thought i 'm going to see if i could do that in a form that didn 't help you guys there at all right so you can draw in your own things like that so you break it all down so i 'm gonna break it down in the bits we 're gonna draw a picture right that 's gonna look more or less like our subject and help us with our subject i 've got the good mate back oh here he is ha as him wilson the parrot haha you all mate the old first mate wilson the pirates here to be a life model he 's taking his bloods off and everything there he is he 's gonna be posing for us and we 'll go all on dough and draw a picture of him right so we look mostly like impression all that but generally likely with a log if you get the shape of it it 's all good right so what do we need well pretty much you just need some pencils for drawing and some paper right some color and pencils to color it later i don 't have any color pencils here because i 'm on ship parade so i didn 't have any color and pencils but you know if you get them and you can color them in so i 'll just do it in gray and box whites and all that kind of stuff and you can work it out yourself but you make whatever colors you like you can go reds and stuff like him green under the wings all that sort of stuff or you know we can just make your imagination go wild but hopefully at the end you 'll have a parrot of your own that you didn 't show put up in your fridge and all that other stuff and go ah this would be wilson or you could name it something else you could have something you terry the parrot ah that sounds like i should have called you terry no all right okay anyway you why anchor go get your paper and pencils and i 'll join you back here at the table for a little bit of drawing at the captain 's table we 'll be having fun i 'm hoping of our starship makes how you be going well you 've been away i 've been gathering up some pencils right and a rubber and also i gathered myself up a little black texture pen there because the color bits would look better if they 're dark but i ain 't got any colored pencils here on the ship right down here in the bilge right so i i haven 't done that so i 'm not going to call the minion i 'll just do a black and white version with a gray and writing a bit of black there with that bit and you can color yours in however you see you fit right and so now we 're going to start with the first bit we 're going to start with all we have to do right it 's already drawing it here right there is be able to drive two of these sort of straight lines right that 's how we 're gonna start okay but i 'm gonna show you how to do it right okay so sounds easy right two straight lines but gotta think this is a head right now you look at wilson right you look at wilson now okay so as you can see shipmates right you don 't want to make his head right because that first bit lines with drawing right there 's this part of his head right so you wouldn 't want to make that like half the body size would you have a huge beginner i mean he 's got a big enough head as it is right so we want to make it proportional right so that 's why we 're going to go start up the top of the page and just draw it down there right so just that much of his her body right so that 's his body down there all the rest and he we 're going to do his tail as well right so that 's the other bits we 've got to do so right so that 's what we 're working there the proportions now you think about that when we go back to the drawing right okay right you see these proportions right these heads up the top there and it comes back down the body so if we do his head half the size right he 's got this huge big head and you 're gonna have a little body down about just a little bitty body right there right no but we don 't want to do that right so let 's say his head 's about a fifth to the size of him right and he 's going to be on a perch there remember he 's got a perch to sit on right so we 'll start at the top and we 'll do maybe about a 50 of the page we 'll do to start our head right so what you want to do is draw those two lines but you got to draw them that one right the squarey one all right sorry the squarey one so like that so let 's draw that right so here it is so we draw it down we 're gonna sort of sit right a little bit off to the left left-hand side there because he 's good this is going to be another front of his head it 's going to go that way you want a bit of space so let 's go let 's go about there right so let 's draw a right angle there we go so go down about that far and the same distance in a right angle that way all right that gives us the beginnings all right that was easy wouldn 't it right now we 're going to draw another line another straight line like the one we 've got here just another straight line i said this one it 's going diagonal right to make it a triangle right so you make it a little right ankle triangle basically so we get that point there right and you just follow it straight through down to make right what 's the next shape we want to draw all right remember i 'll tell you it 's all curves and straight so we 're going to do a little half circle right so basically we 're getting a point here we 're getting it to that point we 're taking it to there like a little r circle right it could just be the back of his head all right all right here we go so we 're going to do it [Music] right if you 're not happy you can rub it out and start again but i 'm more or less happy with that right now what 's next next we 're gonna do some smaller little circles right just little ones all right two little ones all right all right one a little bit bigger than the other right and that 's it so we 're gonna do we 're gonna do them off the front here right so we do about half and half way sort of thing like that maybe a little that one another one there right there we go you got thinking right what 's next we 're going to draw another big curve right okay over here on the thing another big curve on me a bit of scrap paper you see i cut a bit out of that one there so i do want to curve like that so where this curve goes right because this is the beginnings of his beak right so it 's going to come out of the top of his head there this is the top of his head there 's crew in a curve down right down just below his chin it be remember you peek you look at his face all right look at his face there curves all the way down all right okay so we 're drawing this now here we go so we 're going all right that 's the beginning of a beak i reckon that 's the beginning of a b right now we 're gonna go the curl the other way right so i 'm going to take it from about the middle of that guy there i 'm going to go with curl joins it the time now that 's his top beak but oh he 's got a bottom beak too any all right so we 're gonna do another curl up right keeping our curls going this one starts at the bottom remember that one 's out of the top this one 's at the bottom right so it 's gonna go ready ready it 's gonna go from the bottom there and it 's gonna curl up to almost touch that because it 's his beat right and then another curl just to finish it off curl back in and there you go starting look like a beat now and then hey all right what was next well i think next door right we you can do some coloring in so we can actually see what the beat looks like right so we actually color in this bit right the whole thing you can see my lines because i draw it nice and firm but if you color in the whole thing right all this one color right not black but a real color right that you color all that in right failed in kindergarten that 's why i become a pirate there you go that 's his big shape right very nice okay and now to draw his eye right always round shape right so this is we don 't even profile because it 's a bit easier right the drawing profile so we 're going to put his eye and we 're drawing a noise so i 'd rather these patch side because you know a bit more personality than annoying so what you want in this the year up the top right is where the parrot toy goes you draw a circle beautiful oh that 's looking like a pair already i 'm pretty happy with that are you happy with that all right hopefully you 're in the center of the table here you can see that i 'm not over off the shot and all that because that would be a complete disaster in any but you know i 'm not here for camera skills i 'm here for parting skills are happy right now we 're going to do a few dots right for personality so are they 're just a little spots like that right so let 's put it into the spot here right easy way to make a little mark here right it 's a little thing you see with the parrot 's like a little spot there 's a little spot there right and we 're going to make a little center of his eyeball right so we can see him looking because at the moment he 's got lifeless house which is a bit like wilson again to be a bit lifeless at times and all that kind of stuff especially after night out in the room but no we 're going to color in here so we put a little dot in there oh and you see look at that he 's got an away there that 's pretty good in there right right and now we 're going to give that over a bit more character in that way by putting some more curves in remember our curve so we 're going to do some curves on the curves like this right now just get bigger as i go if you start there close and you go always one [Music] there we go now he got his eyes with his beaks all colored in he 's got a little bit lawyer i reckon what do you reckon i think that 's pretty cool i think i could have done it more over this way but you know you win some and other ones you don 't quite win all right but that 's still getting there he 's still looking very paranoid so you 'll know that when you do yours maybe you probably always the center of the page a little bit more uh her all right what are you doing at the same time you probably made the same mistake so sorry about that but you know we 're pirates not drawers but we 're getting there all right so next up we 're going to draw a little v on its side like that see that little bead on the side right this is part of the decorative part of his hat right so little v going out sideways from his hat like that all right that right because he 's wearing like me by this bit he 's wearing one of these fellas you know on there right that 's always that 's what you 're going to do we 're going to have you dressed like that because he wants to drop dressed like me and who wouldn 't want to dress like me i 'm sure you do right all right so we 've drawn our little v right what goes next we 're back to doing curves right because there 's this length there so our little curves right you remember the curves all right well we just join up the ends of the things so we join them up right that 's what we 're doing here right so we 're gonna draw out of that right that 's it okay and now we do the same on the top of this one right so there it is cool now it looks like the ends of a pancake i think he 's been tied to your head and you 've got the bit there tied and that 's your little knot it a bit more decorative right like a spotted one right so we make it spotted the easiest way so you 're not drawing all the spots right is just to use spots off the side of the page so just draw little u shapes again right so we have the little u shapes right but you do have on the hat right so look if we do you know one there one there maybe one there you know one there one there one there maybe you know one here and one there now if we color them in like if i did it with a texture i 'm just going to do with a pencil because i made enough mess with a pencil all right okay and this is i would do this black if i was you or you could do my color if you wanted to color spotted you do them black and then you can color in the middle of it right it 's been here you could color that in a nice bright color like a red or an orange or something different to what statement in it right you just color those bits in that 's all pretty easy now let 's color him in look at that color did and look at that there we go he 's a spotty little added party bird all right which is a wonderful alliteration there all right so that 's it oh what else we need to do right another little gun a little loop but more of an oblong ovally shaped loop right because we want a little tonguey bit for him right okay so we 're going to draw our little tongue in there coming out all right just gives a bit of personality and we 're going to color that bit in right so we just color that bit in this again just gives you a bit more personality because you know parrots are squawking and talking so they want to know whatever tongue there to do that just gives it a bit more personality and all that kind of stuff as we get into our parody person right all right now next up time for some more loins these are the body lines and not like street they 're going to be at an angle right because you know bodies go out shaped like that right so we start at the bottom hey do you write that because that 's where our point that makes it easy point to start right and we 're going to say the body 's going to go down to about a year right not that long is that all right so here we go okay we do the same on the other side remember starting here at the end between the hat and we make sure it 's about the right same places there you go you 've got a bit of a body there but is it the body or is it one side of the wings it 's one side of the wing so what do we do we 've got our little curls again right so we start at the top right and we curl down the joint up at the bottom that 's it same thing on this side right all right cheat a little bit and bring that a little bit 's pretty good right now you get your colored pencils and all that and color them in right so you can do that i 'm just going to just quickly do a little bit of shading with a pencil just because you know i 'm no artiste i got no pencils but you know what i mean so this is so they said that 's gonna all right but you know we need to see the chest stopping right this is a good thing to do with your colored pencils right but i 'm just gonna begin with a black and white is we 're gonna draw loins across loins now all right joining him to give him a bit of like stripeys you know stripey look all right do you think he 'd look good stripy do you all right and we want these down his belly right so let 's start him about here right i hope you can still see move back underneath a little bit all right so there it is again these don 't need to be done with a ruler or anything it 's ship you know you don 't want to send any time doing relays again if these are different colors make sure you give them you know it 's the blue image this is a blue all right there we go that 's him there right now we 've done those right okay what 's next next up we 're going to draw these little dolls all right you know his claws he 's got little claws right let 's have a look at wilson 's ones all right now for chipmates remember we talked about his feet now right little claws right so he 's got three little claws around there and the other one 's called up from the bottom right there and he 's a little yellow closed right so that 's what we 're working on next right drawing his claws all right let me show you how to make them white simple like right there you go you 've seen them right okay all right now you 've seen wilson 's one so what they are little claws so he 's got them there so we be these claws they 're the tops of these claws right so we 're going to do that now so three little loops so you want them to go about a third of the way all right so he 's got a bit of a gap in between right so you go one two three and you start the other one from the other side so you go one two three all right there we go now what you need right is ones from the bottom right but you 're leaving a gap in between i 'll show you why in a minute right okay so you line it up so you 're pretty much under and you go one two three and on this side you go one two three all right that 's looking pretty good in it right okay now what you need to do now is draw a line to join them up right so you draw a line that joins them up you go right you go drawing across to there right and let 's go out this way a bit and up that way let 's get down a little joint up right and we 'll go out this way a bit all right now that right it 's starting to look like a birch right okay now what 's next so we 've got the purge right you 're sitting on the perch it 's not quite finished is it right because it 's open on the end right so what we need to do is put like a little curve so we 're going to curve that way right so we make a little curve that way and then they put another curve that way and it looks like a circle at the end right it looks like a stick there no no it 's like a stick on there and if you just do it a little curve on that end as well it looks like the other end of the stick because perspective right so you 're looking that way i don 't even see that bit in that detail that 's how you get that shape right because the stick 's got to sit in front it 's just to draw lloyd earlier and that gives us the rest of you know his perch right now they look like funny toes don 't they so what we need to do is again use our curve and skills another little curved lines between there all right same here right that same grip and the grip in it right got that all right okay we 've done that bit right so what 's left to do ah you can put like little uh glory shapes you know the shapes of the claws like that kind of stuff on it you can put little things on there to be decorative right you can call these claws in orange or yellow or some other color like that for the parrot oh wilson 's got yellow but you know it 's artistic noises all right so that 's easy they just curves again again just curves there 's all curves in the wings this one there all right and now what we 're gonna do right is color it in right now and again this would be a black one if you color in in there so it doesn 't look like a join right so we go around gotta be careful around that if you don 't go into the air right that 's all that sort of stuff but basically you 're going again not being a color i 'm sure there 's somebody you 're going that 's not how you color but i 'm not saying i 'm just a drawer color i 'm just showing you some tricks some crafty tricks on how to draw a pirate a pirate parrot all right and you know you can use these tricks by breaking down the bits and pieces looking at all the lines and stuff like that it 's a way just learning to draw right oops we gotta be careful here again all right that 's good just away a drawing i 'm just gonna color that in i 'm gonna leave the end white like that there too or read a different color if you like or make it a gray when you do that black because it looks like shadow just see it still looks like a it 's doing that i 'm gonna be right now if i get through this all finished and i find it 's all off camera right now but there we go there we go looking like a pirate there right all right now what else we need we just need the tail again let 's keep it easy we just do little strokes like that down the bottom right so remember this is the back of him right so this is back of him so his tail gonna come down you know behind him so let 's say he 's turned that way so the tail starts like you know about here right so that 's it again you can do this as colors on there just pour it down there and that be these tail feathers all right there we go and that right that there that there but your reasonable facsimile of oh might wilson the parrot right so if you were like in your log and you were looking for the navigational aid that was a parrot shape you 'd see that you are apparent so even know what it looked like just by being able to draw it that well right just by using remember what we used right we 're curves and lines so we 're able to just break it down into where we can put it in a way we can do a curve and a bit of coloring and that is what you end up with our wilson the parrot l mate wilson r and then you know when you finish you can write your signature a big you know luke and silly all right all right there 's my signature all right i 've signed it now all right so there it is another lovely masterpiece of wilson the parrot and hopefully that 's all on camera right now okay i know a minute i 'm gonna hold it up and show it what it looks like next to wilson himself all right there you go and here he is there you go all right so not a bad fact seamlessly for the old wilson i reckon you know basically you see that you think wilson you know it 's pretty you know pre-school failures and all that kind of stuff i reckon but it 's not a bad little way just by doing lines and circles and all that kind of stuff right so that 's our job that 's our class today jordan wilson the parrot me first mate meet jolly first mate there he is nice fella that he is right don 't forget you know tail without man hold that there lovely color do you color yours in remember you look even these little orange and blues and greens all those pretty colors but you make whatever color you like when you color yours in but for me i think i 'm off because it 'd be saturday afternoon and i think it 's time i took a break reed the old captain 's been working hard on the old beatrice here so right now i 'm gonna finish up but as i always do i 'm gonna whistle us out because ah one minute has to stay to tradition don 't we [Music] boy i 'll see you monday night for some more party school _"

    "text": "as part of our garden to kitchen to compost series i am today talking about purple carrots that we grew in our garden and two different things we 're going to make from the pesto from the carrot tops and a delicious and zingy carrot pickle that we 're going to make from the carrots so looking forward to sharing a no-waste recipe with you today super so we 've got these beautiful purple carrots and i have this lovely julienne peeler it 's called it 's got a little um makes little stripes now i find it easier if you 've got the ends to hold on to and you just peel them like that and they shred into lots of beautiful julienne shapes now like i said before these ones are purple on the outside and orange on the inside so that 's a beautiful surprise watch your fingers because they can be quite sharp if you don 't have any edges to hold on to you know so here is what you get a lovely shredded carrot ready for your pickle also have one and a quarter saucepan one cup of white wine vinegar you can also use apple cider vinegar and a quarter of a cup of sugar and a tablespoon of salt so that 's all going to go onto the stove and to go in with the carrots into a clean jar so i always sterilize my jars before i do anything and that 's really important to make sure that you 're putting stuff into a clean jar so you 'll put your carrots and also include some garlic and some chili now the garlic i have from the shops but i have also been growing my own chilies in the garden and my chili plant doesn 't really know that it 's winter it keeps on going and going so i tend to just pop them all into the jar so what we do is pop this on the heat and get the brine so that all of the sugar and salt is dissolved and then we pour it into our clean jar and our carrots and things that are already in there so i 've got these beautiful juliennes of colorful clean sterilized jar put them down and they 're so pretty so they 're lovely to give to friends or to take over when you 're having lunch or salad or something with friends in a socially distant kind of way and here pop a clove of garlic in and there 's a couple of my zingy hot chilies and then very carefully pour our hot brine in to the carrots [Music] uh now you can add different things like dill seeds or whatever you like really for extra flavor [Music] and it 's a good idea just to give it a little tap and bring all those bubbles to the surface and you can also do radish or whatever you like really in these kind of pickles and they will stay in the fridge for about a month um if you do want to do longer lasting pickles you do need to do the heat treat them but these ones in the brine will stay beautifully and they 're just fantastic on a sandwich or on a salad or a buddha bowl or anything like that i like to upside down and then you get that nice seal i 'm going to whizz up the pesto so i 've got my carrot tops i 'll just chop them roughly and stick them in now you can make pesto out of anything um not just basil so i 've also got a bit of rocket in there from the garden and a little bit of parsley squish that all in there juice up some lemon [Music] the cashews there a sprinkle of salt and then a good slurp of olive oil i just popped that in my food processor and i 'm going to give it a whiz so now we 've got a delicious um pesto made from carrot tops i also put a bit of pecorino in there that i had around i was just the end of it um i didn 't have any parmesan but if you want you don 't need to put cheese in really just as long as you 've got some nuts or something and that 's actually really delicious very lemony very zingy and i 'm going to have that on it and just i would just pop that in a jar and just tuck it down but you can keep it for longer if you just put a little bit of olive oil on the top to kind of give it a seal excellent okay so we have the carrot top pesto that 's ready to eat right now and i would put these delicious carrot pickles in the fridge for a day so 24 hours and they 'll be deliciously flavoured and ready for eating tomorrow _"

    "text": "hello my name is ange and i am going to be playing you some originals today uh before i get started i would like to thank the bankstown the canterbury banks town council for um having me be a part of the keep connected program i think it 's really cool and yeah if you like what you hear you can share this on cbtv okay so this first song is called gold um this song is about isolation i wrote it way before this covert stuff happened um i feel like i 've always kind of done this out of anxiety um yeah just feeling like unmotivated when days just kind of bleed into each other i feel like it 's really relevant to a lot of people at the moment it 's about kind of about hurting someone you care about because of how you cope with everything that 's going on yeah this one is called gold [Music] i could make us feel right we [Music] [Laughter] [Music] knowing what i want i felt that world ending you fell too deep and you got cry floating in how to [Music] know your voice [Music] you need you were searching for something all the fears [Music] i [Music] [Applause] i just don 't know how to [Music] is [Music] down [Music] it only says i just don 't know how to pretend [Music] yeah that one was called gold i hope you liked it um okay um for my next song i have a track actually this one is a backing track it 's got like a cool organ sound it 's got guitar drums um and this like really cool lead synth thing um in my recorded version i have my vocals like heavily auto tuned but not for this live version um this one 's called id it 's basically about wanting to be faceless but also wanting to um like accept your circumstances aren 't like great but you know that you 'll come out of things on the other end having like at least learned something about yourself uh yeah this one 's called id here it is [Music] but [Music] [Music] it 's a steady flow oh but i 'll be ready for for very long [Music] [Music] don 't know how to feel about you but nobody 's gonna do the feeling for me i guess i 'm not all right but i will be [Music] myself me [Music] be ready [Music] i looked back and it was just a ghost [Music] this quiet [Music] kindly [Music] ready [Music] [Music] i will be here kindly be ready [Music] yeah that 's id um cool okay uh this next song is called uh elusive haven i think that 's what i 'm gonna call it i 'm not sure yet um i don 't have a track for this one i 'm just gonna play it acoustic um this one 's like this one 's kind of about like the bad outweighing the good in a person or like a situation or a relationship i don 't know um it 's about knowing like who you are what you stand for and one of the biggest things i 've realized in my 17 long years of life that is that you can 't change people who don 't want to be changed no it 's not going to work so for me this song is about accepting that and deciding whether like staying is worth it in the end um yeah this one 's called a lucifen [Music] i saw things in your movements just tell me what you wanted [Music] no i 'm not accusing you i 'm just honest [Music] oh i feel temples with emotion i 'm talking waterfalls if you noticed that [Music] as soft as the clouds they sleep by but you tell me to tell me the fragments lost control at the peak of your verses you don 't care about me i 'm just [Music] surviving [Music] [Music] is they all know how you think how this ends but just want a secrecy not paralyzed when i look at you i see pretty lies and all my time is used no i 'm not unfolding anymore you are my illusive haven you 've got wings angels dead dream of hands as soft as the clouds you sleep on butch you don 't care about me you 're just [Music] surviving [Music] you are my illusive haven as soft as the clowns they sleep on but you tell me to tell me the fragrance lost control at the peak of your viruses you don 't care about me you 're just [Music] surviving you like like i don 't know better for myself god i know better for myself i think god gums get decided like i don 't know better for myself god i know better for myself god i know better for myself [Music] yeah i like that song um that was elusive haven this next one actually i 'll get a drink um okay uh this next one 's called wake up i have a track for this one um so i use ableton to make all my tracks though this one i use logic but it was a long time ago when i made this and it 's got a cool vibe in the beginning there 's like a string sound that you hear and it 's from a plug-in called analog strings by output output is like my favorite plug-in company i guess um so if there are any producers watching this sick their stuff is insanely good um wake up is essentially about my songs called wake up this next one um it 's essentially about growing apart from someone it 's like kind of discomforting when you grow apart from someone you 've known your whole life or you feel like you 've known your whole life anyway um for me you know sometimes i kind of wonder like what would it be like if i still knew people like i used to uh yeah yeah this is wake up [Music] [Music] there must be something in the atmosphere and maybe it 's the lack of anything cause there 's a reason now to hear so you keep chasing that sun down i 'll be outside till i 'm pink and clear cause maybe it [Music] just this is [Applause] [Music] is [Music] just the wrong face [Music] must be too high [Music] this is [Music] [Applause] [Music] so [Music] this is [Music] this is [Music] that was wake up yeah that 's a cool one um right here next we have luck um this song makes me kind of 't know if any of you know who he is he 's like a business guy but he talks about self-awareness and like a bunch of stuff actually he talks about kind of everything um when i wrote this i was in a really good place and i was just kind of pumped and like inspired and i hope that translates yeah it 's just this kind it 's kind of about like just doing your thing not caring about other people 's opinions and just getting on with life you know this is [Music] luck [Music] oh i don 't believe in life [Music] but that doesn 't worry me cause i 'm not those sheep and this blood on my hands [Music] i 'm and i 'm only beginning [Music] is is [Music] and i 'm only beginning [Music] no i 'm not afraid to let you see [Music] me cause i like to think i know bad ways now that my eyes are ready i 'm not complying with the weather i 'm living for myself [Music] [Music] that was luck it 's cool [Music] so um kind of like one of the first like decent songs i think i 've written um it 's about uh feeling like your vices and your flaws are just to drag down everyone who 's close to you um yeah so that i have a track that goes with this one yeah i like it because it 's kind of like the song 's kind of harsh lyrically and it 's like a pretty track and just contrast stuff uh yeah it 's got some cool like little things in it you 'll find you 'll see it 's called monster [Music] don 't let me down [Music] easy own staying is easy but i can 't give you what you want i 'm not the collector a place of wasting time and living is better than love [Music] but if you stay a while longer [Music] reflection that i can 't seem to see my body 's a cage my mind is a monster i 'm just afraid i 'll drag you under my skin but i 'll never ever stop [Music] i 'll just keep burning but i i 'm just afraid [Music] do we gonna talk tonight [Music] is don 't get too close to me you know we gotta cut the lights and try to forget all these stupid dreams if you and i my body 's a cage my mind is a monster i 'm just afraid i 'll drag you under my skin but i 'll never ever stop i 'll never ever stop knowing you 're not safe my heart is trying to change ever stop i 'll never ever stop loving you [Music] i 'm just afraid [Music] i 'm just afraid i 'm just [Music] um [Music] yeah that was monster yeah i hope you liked it once again i would like to thank the canterbury bankstown council for having me be a part of this keep connected program um yeah if you like what you heard um share with your friends on cbtv you know all that kind of stuff okay thank you for listening bye _"

and we thought this is this is incredible and when my dad died I couldn 't write about it for a very long time and as good songs I can 't do that they just come to you real quick this is called these days are gone [Music] beyond through the windscreen and Mama 's gentle smile me and my brother in the backseat where their eyes open wide driving down the old city streets but that is straight at all

fought the good fight all of his fight this vibro family council he built with his own hands he was a rich in left giving back a very decent man we never had thought you but we sure bailed alone

TV thanks to your counsel and you 'll keep connecting program which is awesome and wonderful and you know it 's great to be able to bring music to you and I hope you enjoy these songs they 're all original and this one is called the long way we go [Music] no need [Music] [Music] Oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] there 's a swing swings between [Music] [Music] No [Music] take me along [Music] here to their time [Music] me [Music] [Music] yeah yeah we know yeah we know where we go [Music] yeah so um that was the long way and so originally so did come from a long way to Sydney to make my home here which was around 20 odd years ago and one of the first things that I wrote when I when I got here I remember going down to Bondi Beach and missing to move to Sydney and sitting on the grass looking the ocean writing this song and then pretty much the next day catching a bus back to Perth where I stayed for about another four five years before I came back over again so this is song called all I wanted was you [Music] but my bag did I love you I left in father there was no use in the job is what I wanted [Music] time to sit on my own [Music] another place but math me there except to bring me back to you so what I wanted [Music] you [Music] my chance [Music] is the one I wanted [Music] from the moment I was born never seen that much never left where I 'd come from I 've never made it on my own [Music] so I dreamt out the seven seas and all the people I could be though I wanted you so bad [Music] when all the waters [Music] I 've lost my [Music] so what I wanted to see [Music] made you say goodbye to me and all the things I was to probably ocean [Music] but I don 't never see the moon the way we [Music] the town my chance troubles the plane to see [Music] ah I wanted to see [Music] yeah so um then look I did make a life in Sydney and I wanted to turn and have three lovely children one 's older and two little two little girls and their beautiful wife yes I feel very lucky to be here in Sydney and but there are times where you know you go through hard times and I 've found that some writing has really helped me through those times and this is a song called lost found and it 's about finding someone to help you get through those hard times and doesn 't have to be a hundred people could just be one person could be two people but when you do find them you really you know you do hopefully feel like you think I was right there was much coming around through the paunchy and I had the last word that 's our story went down [Music] [Music] we [Music] and that 's me just feel the time we were tucked in the corner talking until daybreak and then where we part I gave you a car is that you did call me sometime [Music] like you would garden that 's when I knew suddenly everything 's upside-down [Music] [Music] and I heard the window and I saw you start dripping but I held you tight and called out the stress and I on my galloping speed [Music] and I can 't [Music] [Music] beside me but I saw the flowers to die and your hands were bleeding there was blood on your diary you took down my last words we [Music] [Music] you [Music] that was lost bound so yeah I hope you 're enjoying these songs I hope so there if you know personal songs I really don 't get to share them a great deal so to the people of Canterbury and banks down if you 're enjoying them then that 's great and I 've got a website that Ralph calm so I 'll probably post this gig on today so you know if you want to see it that 's where you find a morale calm so look over in Perth where I lived was living in the hills area and a neighboring Hill range called Rolly stone it 's a very beautiful part of the world and in that direction there is a mistake we are alone and once a year they have a tulip show and so the whole beautiful state comes into bloom and I just really loved that space and so I wrote a song it 's a it 's a song about maybe I knew tomorrow after breaking up with someone and you know trying to weave weave that space in with that so I hope you are aligned [Music] and you take the role that was passed raka golly by the time of the drive your head and you wish you 'd last away [Music] and the day is dark and cold [Music] [Music] hi [Music] [Music] and you look around you and the hold you ask you crys [Music] and I try to make like tires football with the galley [Music] it 's hot [Music] today we 'll begin a new I am I spent a bit of time learning about music as a therapy and now Popkin being a singer-songwriter are so a lot of music therapy and I 've always been interested in lots of other therapies just essentially you know like what what helps us get through tough times and it can be music could be art therapy could be massage therapy it could be bibliotherapy reading books you know it 's just there 's so many you know things that we do that help us get through hard times like I 'm sure now is one of those times than many many people and so one of the one of the therapies that I was interested in was surf therapy and I know that it was used a lot for people coming back from war zones and suffering post-traumatic stress syndrome and the reason that surf therapy was suggested is because it it really keeps you in the moment because you really don 't have a chance to be thinking about too much else except for that big massive wave that that you want to ride anyway experience in my own the song could rise up [Music] when I 'm strung out of my body yes it is just and today 's just race and tomorrow 's already I need to break free and make time take myself out all right now and though it might test me on the brake line it 's in there that I when my mind is my heart and my troubles they seem in my own home I feel like I need to break and see that I 've got something to give and I can set things in motion when the way you to rise up and [Music] and when I 'm out on the ocean and my troubles behind will I look back to sure and I see them and I wish I could stay here [Music] [Music] [Music] let the water roll with me in the rush we 've all got our special places where we can break free and see that we 've got something to give and we can set things in motion and I can when the waves rise up [Music] so I 'm writing get to you know reflect on some times and and then trying to make a song out of it so look we had a lovely time when my brother he 's about five years older than me he he got married over in Perth who his lovely wife and so the whole family came together and which only happened very rarely so this is a song called family about my brother 's wedding [Music] it 's easy to get saddest elemento women though this time is that a man spent hours in the water [Music] the kids got hoes down by the grandpa [Music] got that night sister bake the cake in a homemade [Music] we may be flowing now may not know me when the next time [Music] the water in the heels is my old man 's gotta be the groove flowers underneath the trees we came together by the pool is here [Music] the kids got stories from their grandpa and granny and made their bed with a soft white down the plates were on [Music] there was music as dumb went down we may be going [Music] we may be glowing now babbling we may not know [Music] maybe going now may not know [Music] I think that when when you move town and you just state and there you know there 's any inevitable having to say goodbye to people and then you hope that you 're gonna sort of stay connected and but then you know sometimes you just finally done it and this is a song about realizing that there were some people who were very close in my life and then 60 years went by and we just knew that we went our separate ways and before you know it it 's many many years since you 've touched by us and this is a song called East Street which is where I used to live in Fremantle it 's about those friends and I 'm leaning on on a six floor of a high-rise with a smell of mold and leaking gas it 's rusty rails out of here out to sea the first pad their army stream [Music] if I could go back to that time together diamonds and pearls you do to keep those shadows out of reach days pass those times we spend together living high up on East Street now 20 years old and I never see women and it 's hard to believe that we knew even back then but this was the end [Music] but this was the air [Music] cross the track that horse was running at his speed I couldn 't man [Music] [Music] grazi dock cranes and [Music] these past those times we spend together live in high [Music] that we knew even back then this was the end [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] into these [Music] I don 't know but the way I left she was staying here because I was too far gone was my drinking

the council 's keep connected program and share my music my original music live on cb tv thank you so much for having me i 'm going to be playing a selection of my original tunes today which i really hope you 're going to enjoy this first song 's a song i wrote it 's called the right time [Music] oh there 's no such thing as the wrong person it 's only the right side i wouldn 't let you in my world sorry i can make you mine [Music] and i know don 't think drive it 's i don 't think that my heart don 't bleed and i know that it would be so rad sweet baby [Music] there 's no such thing as wasted time there 's only time we 'll spend the lessons that we taught each other [Music] something that i drive me crazy but i can give you what you need i know that it would be some right sweet baby if you were the one for me you were the one for me so next time i hope you find her i love to lift you high [Music] look deep in my eyes you know i can 't lie one day you 'll be fine [Music] don 't think it don 't drive me crazy [Music] that i can 't give you what you need and i know that it would be so right sweet baby [Music] no such thing as the wrong person is only the right time i wouldn 't let you in my world [Music] no such thing as the wrong person there 's only the right time [Music] ah that song the right time uh that 's the title track to my ep that was released in 2012 um of the same title it 's all about finding someone and you know well i found someone and you know they were sort of ready to settle down and i wasn 't and quite often is to timing well this next song just going to grab my capo this next song 's a little song i wrote called stolen by the sunset which is also on my ep the right time but this song i don 't know was it was inspired uh by reading emily bronte 's wuthering heights and i think that that book just paints so many beautiful pictures of a unrequited love so this song is called stolen by the sunset [Music] shared love [Music] like [Music] said it 's not meant to be i don 't wanna have to feel so bad now that i 'm alone i don 't wanna feel so [Music] sad i stood back on the shoreline [Music] my tears are one with the sea [Music] he sailed into the rays of the sun sets her waiting arms filled me with jealousy now that i 'm deserted i don 't wanna feel so bad [Music] i don 't wanna feel so sad mermaids in the ocean and the birds [Music] they come for me as i sit and cry [Music] every time you see sunset will you 't wanna feel so bad now that i 'm alone i don 't wanna feel so sad [Music] i don 't wanna have to feel so bad i don 't wanna feel so sad stolen by the sunset [Music] stolen the sun [Music] ah song stolen by the sunset uh now this next song of mine um that i wrote which is also off my ep the right time [Laughter] is a song called here i am and it was a song that was inspired by reading a book called the alchemist and in the story of the alchemist um our protagonist sets off on a journey to find many things but ultimately i think he 's looking to find himself and the funny thing is is that by the time the story wraps up he sort of finds out that everything he was looking for was always there right under his nose to begin with um so this song 's a little bit like that um it 's about traveling around and realizing that uh yeah everything you 've always wanted is right there and or needed actually there 've always needed is right there in front of you so called here i am it 's been a while since i got off this train and some things never seem to change these tracks i 'm taking on this journey of mine riding through the night till the morning sunrise ticket that took me to a place i belong midnight express i 'm coming home and here i [Music] am is right here in my hands tonight i see things for the first time is all the people the time has changed the story stopped by the lines on their base and on the streets they remember my name and through their eyes i 'm a child again ticket that took me to a place i belong midnight express i 'm coming home here i am [Music] i see things [Music] and all the things in life that are taken for granted have always been here right in front of my eyes [Music] so [Music] is right here in my hands i see things [Music] i see things so clear for the first time [Music] in [Music] oh here song and i 'm sure many women out there would have met a character like this at some stage in their lives this is a song about a casanova um [Music] yeah a song that has uh all the trappings of a man who has the gift of the gab that can readily sweep women off their feet but uh he might not necessarily have the best intentions this is a little song i wrote called the player you have got to resist his charms he 's a player a player you won 't find love in his arms he 's a player player it 's getting it [Music] he 's already moving [Music] one thing on his mind [Music] and it 's not love just a dance off seduction never try [Music] cause i 've seen them rise never fall as they take their chances but if they 'd had known from the stars you 'll never win his heart and you have got to resist his chance he 's a player player you won 't find love in his arms he 's a [Music] [Music] a master of his charms he 's a player a player you won 't find love in his arms he 's a player player you have got to resist his charge he 's a player player you won 't find love in his arms he 's a player a player [Music] his burning hunger don 't take a bite from that apple from adam and eve you 'll never win his heart [Music] you have got to resist his charms he 's a player a player you won 't find love in his arms he 's a player a player you have got to resist his charge he 's a player [Music] player you won 't find love in his arms he 's a player [Music] players he 's a player song about a uh naughty man called player maybe it was written from personal experience maybe maybe okay so this next song 's a little song i wrote called let it happen and it 's all about wanting to find true love you know and in order to find true love sometimes we have to be able to let it in first let yourself be so easily misled hey girl need to stand alone but you let your heart be so easily misled smile and you try to fake it smile he might see will time make me brave enough to let my poor heart breathe and let your heart live an emotion run free and then if this

to take over the tiller just for this week just why he 's away hi i 'm going to be teaching you a good old maritime fish recipe we like fish in the sea so we really got off the toilet because they 're all about right this be a family recipe my dear old i used to scream it from the cell and it write me me right simple too i only took me 13 visits to get it in the old brain pan right that 's what it is it 's salmon pan freud salmon in dill and caper butter sauce ah sounds really tasty don 't it well i 'm gonna show you how it is and i brought me cooking implements with me right i brought me red board nice breadboard right i brought me cutlass and i 'm ready to prep right now what cut this in your breadboard right we 're gonna have a soy dish of potatoes because we 've got lots of potatoes around here at the moment potatoes really handy things to have right lots of nutrients right so we 've got some sweet potatoes and some normal potatoes right we 're gonna cut them up we 're gonna make salt and pepper potatoes because any veggies right you can just spice up a little bit right just give them a bit extra taste with a bit of salt and pepper it 's amazing what you do with salt and pepper right well i 'm using salt and pepper right you use the old goblets to keep it in i like to use the actual grounds the actual you know the peppercorns there and the actual rock salt right do we get because you know it 's probably authentic stuff and then you just crush it down do a little you crush it all down so it 's nice and full in and then you 'll spread it on the dish later on so i might get away from there 's nice and fine and then you do that to put it all over cause you do a little bit on the salmon and you do a lot of salt and pepper on your spots right all right that 's all it was so what else do we know about what else is in this dish well but in a fish dish you gotta have a lemon right and we 're just gonna cut that lemon at this stage you just did two why are we getting all the prep ready right because later on we 're gonna squeeze it for the juice squeeze the very juice out of it right all right okay that 's that done now next we 've got the dill all right now the dill you 'll see that till right it 's right it 's a herb it 's a tropical herb right first pulled over by those dutch you know they did their company they brought it over euro first on right and the deal 's a great little one thing there 's a great little herb right so what we 're going so chop it up nice and fine you do right the table because it comes on the end it 's part of the sauce right so you 're there all right so it 's nice and falling all right very good see noise and volume there we go cut up nice and fine can you see that all right there we go all right oh what we do with that got those and the other thing that 's in there is the capers now what a capers are you 're right here you don 't have to cut these up right these little round blowers right when i first saw them you smell them right anything they smell like the seed they 're like fish eggs are they fish eggs capers they 're fish eggs but they ain 't_:_219.2 they 're not the capers they be little flower buds right little flower buds not turned into flowers right but they pickle them which gives them that smell the smaller the better right because that 's what makes some tastier capers really good other good thing about these little capers right little bit of vitamin c but lots of vitamin k and as a pirate i appreciate vitamin k because it helps you congeal your blood and stuff and that comes in right andy when you 're pirate all right so they 're the capers and right they 're mediterranean so we 've get bit of a mixture here but that 's what we are like pirates because they 're all comfortable walks of life and all that kind of stuff pretty much anyone you captured quickly you can come on and become part of the cruise you learn all these little tricks right so that 's it we got the potatoes now the potatoes we 're dicing all right we 're cutting them up into cubes little cute cubes right because you got that that 's always you know that about that there right five centimetres they call them now you know or something like that you know just small cubes because then they cook up quicker right they 're not waiting around forever because you know you never know when you 're gonna have to uh use your cutlets or just mount the ship or doing something like that already all right so you cut these up so cup and then the cubes all right okay now that 's all i prep done what 'd i tell you it 's easy so next we 'll do the prepping and the cooking all right the last bit of prepping and the cooking all right so we 'll get to that right now right so here we have it right your potatoes all cut up right nice little cubes see that i saw this cube cute ones how 's that good and no no i i left the skin on right we have to skin all these things on right because that 's all the vitamins and stuff all right they 're in the skin all right so you get them all right put them into a nice bowl right this one i got here for my old shipmate where it works right so you put all them in the bowl right man right we gotta jump there because i 'm holding the camera myself at the same time and holding things means occasionally gonna get a bit of a jump cut so i apologize to all you film school students just think i 'm one of them fancy french type directors right you 're supposed to feel disconnected so you know it 's a film all right just think about that right oh look god already all right there we go so once you 've got them in the bowl i mean lovely bowl here we 've got from your shipmate young mr werner did all these for me it was literally bold right then what you need is some oil right i didn 't mention that before but you need some oil i tend to use oil oil so we can go well oil be etc etc but olive oil will do as well so all right put a bit of oil on it right you want saturated oil there because that 's what helps besides it makes it also make the veggies crispy also helps your pepper all right they make pepper all ground up did a good job with that with the old back of the hill out so if it 's all over it right you want to see you want it all over the whole thing right there it is you can see it see how it 's getting on there it 's sort of coating it you want it coated right you got that lovely i could go on like this for hours but then you 'd switch off so that 's me coating it all right then you take what you coated you stick it in the urban pan right put plan for your ribbon you stick it in your ribbon for about 20 to 25 minutes right on about 2 20 or 8 2 30. you need smally not too hot you stick it up high so there 's an air underneath it you can do that right out to get that crispiness and you just let the burgers cook pretty easy right probably add a little bit more pepper and stuff on there but you get the idea you do it to taste i like it quite peppery it 's probably because of all the rum i 've been drinking my out in the sun a lot but you know we 'll go over there so that be the spots you just put them in while they 're cooking you can get all your other stuff ready all right what 's on next right now time for the salmon now normally normally i 've got these two lovely fillets here two little black fluids just for light meal right here they are too late now normally i just use a bit of calico with this they 'll crust you a bit of calico but they tell me because you know and since bars away you know health and safety type stuff that i 've got to use these paper towels but you know calico would have been good anyway what you want to do what i 'm doing right is drying them out because when they 're being kept right these phillips when you 've got those fillets they get a bit moisture they pick up a lot of moisture if you want to dry them out first you 'll find they 'll cook better that way right okay nice little i 'm going to use this bowl again just while i put a bit of salt on them to season them right you want to season your fish just helps them cook a bit better right now let 's see how it 's nice and dry so draw it stick it to that right there we go i 'm using that again because that 'll get a bit oil on it as well which would just help on the cooking so you don 't have to wear this much oil in the pan all right so a little bit of pet salt on there and some pepper all right and i 'll do the other side in the pan all right all right throw that in and that 'll just cook up nice there you sit like that so that 's what activates the cooking juices are that right anyway so i 'm going to get that on there and you can see it on the pen and it will make more sense right now them all the jesus on there 's no noise it 's starting to come along bit of me whale oil right to the palm just to stop it from sticking babe i 've got me a little salted little salmon there i put him in there give him little swim in the oil again just a little stick all right now normally normally right you 'd probably stick these on the skin side first and cook them on the skin soy first but uh these ones have been cut in a fashion that um i like to attack that first mate because they 've been cut in different ways so you go to that 's not really much point there so you need to crisp them up if you make a bit harder otherwise they 'll just fall over all the time right but now pan 's getting hot there fishes on there and so you just need to get them cooking give them return every so often with your cutlass all right just give them a bit of a tip over every time when you cut this after they 've had a chance to cook so you 're looking at maybe two minutes each like that all right a little salmon steak a little bit except look at the house there that 's beautiful that is sorry be right tasty this so right you can see when you turn them over your nice spring and there but you know it 's all good crisp for the mill all right i 'll be right back how brown that is there right that 's perfect right there now you turn the heat down about half right you get it down [Music] now up a bit there if it 's melting and squeezing your lemon right here [Music] beautiful right [Music] all right all right then you 've got to pan off the directory right remember your deal all right see that okay just to leave right not the stalks all right you can mix that in there right in there you got your cables get amongst that source right mix it in all right so just sell that buttery flavor to it right support your flavor that kind of stuff and then again over your fish right right so it actually gets that flavor just soaking 're ready to serve right get those potatoes on the bait let 's see what we got here ah then you do a bit of platinum get them potatoes on there nice and all that kind of stuff there we are dinner of champions let 's look at this look at this there you go can you see that here we go look at that all right there we go there you go look at that lonely bit of salmon you see the dill and pickles on there beautiful lovely crispy veggies tastes beautiful right and that be our dish for today yeah celebrity chef and hurry to her you know anson we might start one of those new series you know my kitchen rules the sea that be a nice idea but that 's it all right so that 's salmon and dill and cape are butter sauce so simple it 's quick any old pirate can make it you know even that going with a big leg and the hook and the patch and the power that keeps doing things down his shoulder right he can do it and people taste and think my goodness you 're a gourmet and you say no i 'd be a pirate and i 'd be cooking you some fish all right shoot me so you guys will be back next week you 'll be grateful for that but anyway i 'll be signing off now so i remember the gr _"

    "text": "welcome everybody um thank you for joining us tonight my name is anita pessa and i am the community development officer for children and families for canterbury bankstown council tonight we welcome madeleine winter from hand-in-hand parenting uh she 's part of our suite of parenting programs that we are delivering online to parents um whilst we are all enduring the covert 19 pandemic and not being able to meet each other face to face we are providing a variety of online parenting programs tonight madeleine will be talking with us about how to support our children and ourselves when children are displaying behaviors of separation anxiety so i welcome madeleine tonight uh thank you all for joining us and i 'll hand over to madeline winter now thank you anita i 'm really pleased to be here um it 's good so welcome everyone um let me just get this right screen on so welcome welcome um here 's my attempt at multiple languages um i never learnt more than english sadly so with the help of google translate welcome and if i 've got anything wrong feel free you and um yeah and i want to just acknowledge country here and sorry i 'm getting my thing so i 'd like to show my respect to the traditional owners where i 'm sitting it 's the wongal aboriginal people of the eora nation and to acknowledge their elders past and present and i 'd like to acknowledge that indigenous culture survives and thrives and that we have all gained from what they 've lost and um as we begin you 're all on silent and the beautiful anita is my assistant if you need to talk to anyone you can use the chat function to ask a question or to um if you 're having some technical difficulty and we will have a go at answering any questions that that come up along the way at the end and some of you did identify things you wanted to know a bit more about so toward the end i will touch on those so when you registered some of you said i 'm interested in this so um and we will hopefully send you a recording and definitely send find some more resources um which i 've put up on my website and one of the resources that i love to offer i love to hear from you and um you 're welcome to get in touch with me you can use this link and we 'll we 'll send an email out with a link and we can set up a short free consultation to get it i can get a better picture of what 's going on in your family and of where you might be able to find some resources that will help or how i can help so um and um i like to start here which is the truth about you as a parent which is that you are a good parent really you have always done the very very best that you can if you could have done different you would have there is not enough support so as a you really face real struggles and difficulties and you 're not to blame for those that they 're not your fault there are things you 're probably responsible for making sure get fixed your fault you 're doing the very best that you can and there just isn 't enough support and someday you 'll get a little rest and here is my dear husband resting this is commonly what happens when we go out i think he 's pretty tired um after 16 years we 're parents of a 16 year old so there he is hopefully you 'll get a little rest the other thing about what i want to communicate today is that um we all make mistakes and we we we have the best of intentions i love being part of this group called parents i 've worked with lots of different groups and i 've not worked with a group of people who are as motivated to [Music] to work through what needs to be worked through as we are as parents so we have the best of intentions but sometimes those don 't get us where we need to go so this dear little duck has taken her ducklings out for a walk and unfortunately did not plan the trip well enough and i 'm going to a pickle but this happens to us all so what i want to do here today is to help you avoid and to recover from your parenting fails we all have them it 's not possible to get by without them but the tools that i work with and that i teach are as much about fixing things up as they are about we get as parents we get really preoccupied with trying to stop bad things from happening but actually uh the thing we have real control over is um is fixing things up you know we need to be responsible our children are relying on us but we need to focus as much on the repair as on the sort of protection at the front end so a little bit about me this is my husband again and my sweet daughter when she was somewhat younger than she is now um oh sorry so i 've done all sorts of different things and and eventually i found my way to parenting which i didn 't think i was going to do but has proven to be the best was better late than never i only managed to squeeze out one but she 's a gem and i 've worked with hand in hand with this parenting approach for over 30 years i did quite a lot of experiments on other people 's children and then i had my daughter and she just knew what to do and i found myself very quickly wanting to share these resources with other parents and my main um the thing i get most out of it is just how good it is to connect with other parents and get perspective that this is not my fault that the that this is not you know my private problem but that you know almost every other parent is struggling you know with one or the other of these things um it really does help to put things in perspective we get so isolated so i love to connect with you and my aim today is to talk about why separations are hard um to talk a bit about preparing and what that 's about is about making things safe for your child in their playing that are incredibly good for building connection and safety in your relationship with your child and we teach some tools for listening to your children and um working through their feelings and connected with that what 's really important is that you get some support for yourself so we teach some tools that are about that and then once you 've prepared and had a chance to think about the challenge um we we approach separation as it 's it 's really i mean almost all parenting is actually a limit setting exercise basically um so separation is a limit setting exercise they want to stay with you you have to go or you want to go um so it 's something that you 're going to need to bring limits around it 's actually not useful to your child to never separate from them and i 'll talk a little bit about that later but um we recommend actually planning for it and and using an approach called the long goodbye so not avoiding um not avoiding the issue your child has big feelings about being away from through those feelings in order to be able to remember that they 're connected to you and be able to move on to other things while you 're not there and know that you 're going to come back and you can get some more information i recommend these little booklets they actually don 't make any print ones anymore but you can get electronic pdf versions of them um we 'll send you out some links later um they 're great little books that describe each of these listening tools and they 're just unlike their little booklets unlike books there 's not a lot of paragraphs you want to skip through which i quite like i don 't have a lot of time so you can find me on my website um and i highly recommend um hand-in-hand parenting produce a number of short online courses and you can find out more about those on my website they 're 55 each they don 't cover the whole hand-in-hand approach but they they cover the important bits and they describe the listening tools and how you can use them here because separating from your young ones is a challenge and you may find that this course is really useful it 's about three hours of video um so and i 'm always there if you want to talk to someone about how can i make this work in my family and i 've put together a page of resources for you in um in that link there at the bottom separation anxiety recovery so there 's a bunch of bits and pieces there so hand-in-hand parenting um is an approach that i call it the approach is kind of like a love triangle so on the one hand there 's um the correction piece so you need to be able to leave um your child 's clinging onto you and you need to separate from them that 's a limit setting exercise that 's correction you know there 's a million other things you might set limits around um we 'll talk about them at some other in some other webinars our focus as parents tends to be on that on on the business of making sure our kids it works best if there 's a balance between connection and correction and when there 's not enough often problems with getting kids to do things and tr managing transitions and big upsets about you leaving is about kind of trying to get them to do something which is be without you happily um when there 's trouble around that it 's usually a sign that there 's a connection problem we get we keep thinking if we just tell them clearly enough they 'll do what we want but actually a lot of the time what we need to do is figure out how to fill up the connection cup and other things flow out of that and at the base of this love triangle is something that as parents i think we don 't get enough of and we often don 't value in the way that we need to which is support you need support it 's really complex work it 's emotional work and we teach a listening tool which is an adult to adult listening tool called um a listening partnership and it 's a often gets in the way of being the parent you want to be get to think about what your challenge is and plan for change those things all together build what i call emotional safety what you 're doing is building emotional safety and that is what will have things that that 's what it takes in this long term project that is parenting what you want out of this is not really you know you want to be able to leave without a big upset but you know what you really want is a 25 year old who wants to spend time with you you want to have got the relationship right and we can get preoccupied with the bits and pieces so um what 's all the fuss about well it turns out that um connection is fundamental i like to say that it greases the wheels of family life and when our kids connection cup is full enough um things go easier and a sense of it the more research and in the last 20 years or so you know there 's been a lot more researchers brains but basically connection is human beings can 't really function if they if they don 't feel connected to other human beings and i heard an interesting program on the radio where they 'd done some research into the movement patterns of twins and it turns out that even in utero twins respond differently in their movement patterns toward each other than they do when they bump into you know what is basically the walls of their home which is their mother 's womb so already before they 're even born they 're tuned into each other and then someone asked a question about dealing with separation in covid and i will talk about that a bit but i got a glimpse recently where i had i wasn 't well and i needed a doctor 's certificate and i thought i 'd be smart and get on the tele health and rang up the local medical center well it turned out the young man there who i 'd never met because i haven 't been there before um wasn 't really happy to do telehealth with me and he i got up there and got my medical certificate and when i got out from the doctor 's surgery i felt like a hundred percent better and it was because i 'd had contact with this young man who i will never meet again who i have never met before but in this extra sort of isolation it 's probably not quite so bad now what what i 've really noticed is that all those little interactions with people are so important to having me feel okay and i was so surprised to feel so much better after this interaction very business-like interaction with this young man who was the doctor so we need to be around other people and interacting with other people and separation is i think you know one of the main projects for young children you know they start off literally physically connected to somebody and it 's a gradual process as they develop of moving away of extending out and tending to come back and then moving out to explore the world so it 's a kind of constant process of separation it 's actually it it 's unlikely that it will be permanently over and done with it 'll come in layers so i think it 's the big emotional project for all young people and their parents turns out we have feelings about it it 's inevitable human beings have to separate from one another it 's repeated it will happen over and over and as it 's in layers as a child sort of stretches out developmentally they start exploring new things they will feel the distance from us more there 'll be more feelings about that and then there 'll be a period of consolidation where they get their confidence up and they get sort of comfortable with that degree of separation and then something shifts for them and they shift out into the world bit further and when they do that they get to feel the feeling of separation and there 's nothing wrong with that but it 's a feeling and we need to help them through it which is not something that i think our culture is terribly good at um the other thing is that it 's it 's felt just as much by boys as girls and sometimes i run play events and um my mum came with her boy and he was very confident and she said oh it was a general class so we weren 't just talking about separation but she said oh he won 't have any trouble so we set up this play event where the adults get to play and play just the way the children want and then half the parents go off for a listening partnership and that that 's an opportunity often because the kids have got really well connected and they 're really enjoying themselves it 's often an opportunity if a child 's got some feelings about separating often they 'll come up then and we teach a listening tool called stay listening so everybody 's ready to listen to kids while their parents go for a really quite short 10 or 15 minute break and he really had a huge sob this boy who happily goes off to school who never had any trouble going to preschool but with the right environment he had needed to feel and that we 'd built the safety and he was able to feel them so all kids feel this um i like to just orient us this way the longer i 've been working with these tools and with parents the more i think about it as an as a relationship bank balance that 's not about getting your kid to do something it 's about balancing um connection with correction and building [Music] it 's like a bank account when you set a limit you you take you withdraw from the bank account when you play and listen to your child you you put credits into your bank account your relationship bank account and when there 's enough credit in the bank account um generally your relationship with your child will be characterized by closeness and cooperation transitions coming and going will be easy there 's just not going to be a whole lot of snarls when there 's lots of struggles and when you find yourself feeling like you 're constantly setting limits that 's sometimes a sign that there 's not enough connection credit i said earlier we often focus on on trying to get them to do the right thing and sometimes if we take a step back and focus instead on building the connection credit things shift in ways that are useful so um what i want to talk to you about this evening is a process for working through a child 's feelings about separation so the first piece that we need to do is plan the next is that we need to connect and build fill up a child 's connection cup put lots of connection credits in the relationship bank balance then we need to bring our child 's attention to the fact that we 're going to leave so part of the plan is about figuring out when these feelings are going to come up and what i love about working with parents around separation is that you don 't have to wait to deal with it you don 't have to wait until you actually have to leave all you have to do to get the process moving so that you can do some emotional work with have to do is make it clear that you 're going to leave so you can do that anytime and in fact i recommend in your planning process thinking about when it is that these feelings come up and how you could organize things so that those feelings come up at a time when you have the time to listen because when we 're dropping our kids off at daycare um we 're usually on our way somewhere we generally don 't have the time to listen quite aside from the fact that i 'm i don 't think daycare is the place to do the listening we want to be able to listen to our child 's sadness about us leaving in a place where it 's actually safe for them to be sad and day cares often not child care is and school is often not a safe place for them to have a big upset the teachers are too stretched they 're worried that other kids are going to get infected by your child 's sadness and generally big feelings it 's not an easy place for big feelings about separating from you there 's nothing wrong with them if they do that 's normal it 's a normal human process if they get to have a good cry about it actually separations and transitions will be easier so we 're planning we 're connecting and i 'll talk about a tool for connecting we 're proposing to leave at some point and then we want to be able to leave do that slow things down so that our children can have the feelings that are hanging around about us leaving and we 've got time to listen then at some point we 're going to need to leave and leaving is fine someone asked about what to do about our children at daycare um you know drop off at daycare and in fact if you get to my webpage that 's about separation anxiety i 've got a 15 minute video just about drop and leave at daycare and i actually recommend drop and leave but for that to work well for your child you need to be tackling their feelings about separation at other times to reconnect and sometimes that 's enough and again special time which i 'll talk about this evening is a fantastic way to do that really really efficient way of build of reconnecting and building a sense that you 're on your child 's side that 's what they need to be able to hang on to in order to be able to leave you confidently so um you can reconnect and often you 'll need to do a bit of listening there as well if they 've got some leftover feelings about you having been gone you 'll probably do some listening there so i i generally need to talk a little bit about time out time out is a tricky thing i actually think it 's a very valuable thing for us parents we need time out we need a place where we can download how we 're feeling where we can get the support that we need where we can plan how we 're going to tackle an area in our relationship with our child that 's difficult or where there 's been consistent trouble and where i can highly recommend listening partnerships for that i 'll talk a little bit about that if we were meeting in person i 'd get you to have a try um but i 'll give you a little bit of information about that and some more when we send you something out what children need is not time out time out is disconnecting and connection is the thing they need when they 're in trouble so timeout 's not useful for kids i like to think about what we need to do for children as time in they need connection they need a chance to have feelings about things and when we connect with them and when we listen to their feelings what happens on the other side of that is that their thinking brain can engage and they can cooperate and figure out what 's workable when they 're disconnected and they 're flooded with feelings that 's when they 're behaving in ways that are not workable and we end up having to bring limits so the first thing is about you how you feel about leaving your children are to do with sadly what happened to us when we were young how were your upsets handled when you were young what were goodbyes like when you were a child the thing that happens to us and parenting is a constant process of this is that our um our minds are constantly something happens and our mind goes back we go back to find out what do i already know about this and if we 're confronted with an upset two-year-old who doesn 't want to leave our mind will go back and it will go back to what it was like for us when we were two parenting is a constant process of being reminded what it was i 'm in the middle of working through i 'm telling the story of my teen years at the moment because living with a teen i 'm constantly reminded of my teen years which for most of us were not easy there usually wasn 't a lot of help and we 're on our own trying to figure out really big things so in my i 'll talk about listening partnership i 'm telling the story of my 10 years because i know that when my daughter has struggles i am thrown back into what happened to me then well that 's happening to us all the time as parents so when something bugs us about our child or when we 're struggling with something it 's really useful to find someone to listen to you and have a think about what does this remind me of how is this connected to what happened to me what happens is our brain goes back to find information but if there 's big feelings that happened at that time if someone was really tense with us um if limits were set harshly or even violently um if we were hurt or belittled or anyway if the experience was stressful what will happen is the information comes up and this and the stressful ex the feeling that went with it so we get that you know that flash that you have as a parent when your child does something that flash is like a red blinking sign that something happened to you little to do with what 's actually happening now we need to be finding a place to talk about that stuff as parents in order to be able to work out how should we respond to our child 's challenge now so you need a chance to go and talk about what it was like for you about how frustrated you are about what you want and also be thinking about when are these upsets coming up when is separation coming up how can i plan to a project around helping my child feel those feelings because it 's it 's like a cup they have a connection cup and they have a feeling cup and what you want to do is fill the connection cup and drain the feeling cup when the filling cup is drained enough they 're able to think then you know the feelings will build up again and they 'll be finding things to get upset about suddenly separations are difficult again but you can figure out how to drain that cup again so and one of the things we often need to think about do we around separations how do we make time so that we don 't have to rush off but we can actually deal with our child 's upset instead of trying to get over it because feelings don 't disappear they go underground if you don 't have a chance to work on separation feelings when your child is little you may find that say when they first get to daycare or when they start at school it 's a really big deal they 've got a huge lot of feelings that are coming up around that big separation starting school 's huge anyway a listening partnership is a great place to do all of those things i use them all the time i use them for my parenting and all sorts of other things i mean i 've spent time in my listening partnerships doing filing because i hate it so much and i have so many feelings about it it 's very useful so it 's time out for parents you want to find someone who agrees to listen to you and then what will happen is you you want to have roughly equal time because some people are big talkers like me and other people are a little shyer but everyone has a story to tell and it 's useful for everyone to get a chance to tell their story and we want to listen with warmth and full attention and the big three big things we want to resist the temptation to interrupt with our own story when i first got introduced to this process i remember sitting on the bus and listening to people talk a lot of what people are doing when they 're talking with each other is listening for a bit then they 're remembering something about their own experience and then they um start to talk they interrupt they start to talk about their story so um you want to take turns don 't interrupt with your story you 'll get your turn and you also don 't want to give advice really resist the temptation to give advice there 's a bucket load of advice out there about how you should handle things and what you should do and what you to figure out what you think about that advice you don 't need advice what 's what 's really in short supply is someone to listen to while you figure it out for yourself and then the thing that makes it safe for you to really show what 's going on for you is to know that it 's confidential that whatever you say in that time never gets mentioned again ever you might raise it but no one else will no one will tell the story somewhere else the person who 's just been listening to you will never mention it again that makes it really safe to admit to like i said before we all have parenting fails one of the hard things is not sort of being able to share those honestly and share how we feel about them for fear of being criticized or judged or for fear of people using that against us somehow so it 's really important to keep it confidential so that 's that 's for us that 's part of the planning process i want to move on to just is difficult um when children don 't feel safe what happens is stressful experiences generate or create emotional tension and they kind of store that tension in what you might call their emotional backpack and if those feelings don 't get dealt with and don 't get drained um they they 're quite they 're sticky so they get bigger so a little one who doesn 't get a chance to work on separation their fears about separation get bigger or and they 've separation is a fear um separation difficulty is about fear and um fears are really sticky and they snowball so they get bigger it 's not about separation but an example is um one of my daughter 's friends was really when they were smaller was really scared of cats she can 't we have a cat she would come over for a playdate and it was really hard going and a few months later i saw her dad and he said oh we 've got to the point where we can 't go out and eat outside at a restaurant because she 's now really happens a fear that doesn 't get handled well and a child doesn 't get help with it it it snowballs and those big feelings drive what we call off track behavior um so when kids are not able to cooperate when they can 't leave you easily that 's that 's you know a i don 't want to make it sound like i think feelings about separation are somehow themselves off track but a child who can tell they 're really well connected to you who 's whose cup of feelings is not overflowing will be able to leave you confidently and if they can 't then there 's a project there that you need to give them a hand with the other thing that young people do is that they 'll choose small issues to have big feelings about um those big feelings can be about it 's not you don 't you know you can 't really know what they 're about but i 'm sure you 've all had the experience of a child um getting terribly upset about something that just seems ridiculous around a story um they were moving out of the house that that they 'd their child had been born in and had grown up in and um the child was about 10 at that point and he really didn 't want to move house and some months before they had to move so he was a bit upset about it um and some months before they had to move the television busted and at that point um the television was an old one it wasn 't one of these flat screen things and it was sort of deeper than it was wide so it 's like this is not a television you would you would in any sense get upset about having busted you know and he had a huge sad wailing sadness about losing the television like sometimes they have upsets about things that are just so silly that you that you have to believe that it 's about something else that happens all the time um at a time when um my friends my friend 's daughter was starting school she came into the kitchen and she had the teddy bear and she said to her mum i 'm i 'm gonna grandma 's gonna want purple bear back and my friend thought grandma is not gonna want purple pear back you know if you want purple bear grandma will give you purple bear but then she thought this you know this is this is not about purple bear sometimes we have a kind of hint it 's like oh we can remember that there 's a bigger picture and in this case the bigger picture was heading towards starting school which is a really big deal and a huge separation for young ones so instead of reassuring her daughter my friend said sweetheart it 'll be sad to lose purple bear and that 's a whoa [Music] so yeah a really big cry about purple bear mum could have said don 't worry you won 't have to lose purple bear but mum could tell that actually there were big feelings around and purple bear was a pretext was a chance to have an upset about big sadness and um that 's called when we choose to things up that 's called stay listening so their mums stay listened and after a while you know purple bear was forgotten but really she 'd had a chance to cry about something else her mum was guessing that it was about heading towards school and unfortunately if we stop so if mum had said sweetheart grandma won 't_''_2500.72 you know grandma won 't take purple bear back i think that mother would have missed an opportunity we we 're very tempted to do that i think as parents were kind of biologically biologically sort of programmed to fix things up our child has an upset and we want to fix it up and sometimes that works and sometimes it doesn 't matter what you do there 's just one upset after another and nothing 's right that 's a child who 's looking for an opportunity to get upset and unfortunately all that fixing up that we do all those ways that we stop children from showing their feelings it doesn 't make the feelings go away it just makes them go underground so especially around separation the more feel sad about us leaving um the more they 're getting rid of a pile of stuff that 's getting in their way of moving into the world happily and enthusiastically and whenever we can if we can listen to those feelings it will be helpful so when a child feels safe what happens is if they 're carrying big feelings in their emotional backpack they will release them and it turns out this is a process a healing process so tears contain stress hormones and another way human beings release grief and tantrums are not some kind of nasty plan to stuff up your day although that 's might be what they do but tantrums allow a person to release frustration laughter is really important it it 's what it 's how people release fear so when kids when kids are in trouble at school and they laugh teachers often get pretty tense about it but actually the reason the kids are laughing is because they 're scared and laughing 's what we do when we 're scared amongst other things um there 's a reason that we told because we 're a little bit scared about all that and we tell jokes to try and get to laugh about it doesn 't mean you know mean jokes are okay but that 's what the process is and um you know when our children are really upset and they 're struggling you 'll notice if you 're able to let the upset happen and not stop it and not let it worry you they will they especially little ones children pop out knowing how to do this like i said my daughter didn 't have to go to a class to learn how to do this she popped out knowing how to have a good old rage or a good old sort of offload of frustration in a tantrum or a deep deep cry so the thrashing around that a little one does when they 're upset the struggle they often get really sweaty they may shake all of that is how they get rid of emotions that are getting in the way of them thinking straight um it 's also true of us but by the time we of taken on the message that um releasing feelings isn 't a good idea and it 's much harder for us to do it but our little ones come out knowing how to do it um so this is a picture of what time in does so a child is struggling with some kind of emotional tension that might be because they got disconnected somehow they lost their sense of connection with us but also when big feelings come up that causes them to lose their sense of connection with us and they signal for help when that happens they go off track so a big upset about not wanting you to leave is a signal that they 've got some big feelings and they they 're not feeling connected enough to be able to confidently go out in the world and if you cannot fix it like the mum did with purple bear not try and solve the problem but actually bring a limit sweetheart it 'll be sad to lose purple bear sweetheart i do have to go i can 't stay something we always need to say you i 'll always come back to you that 's very important and the other thing is it 's very important not to sneak off if you sneak off you children end up feeling very it really um breaks their confidence in you and they they worry it lays in a worry that you may just disappear it sometimes we do it because we don 't we we find the upset that they feel about us leaving hard but it 's really not a good idea to sneak off you need to always tell your child that you 're leaving um so if we don 't if we don 't to fix the problem if we just hold the limit sweetheart i am gonna go and we listen to the upset that comes up then at some point our child will shift to being able to happily let us go um there was a thought it 's gone so it might come back so we need to have a listening partnership or some place where we can plan when is it that my child gets upset about leaving you know then can i make can i figure out how to make more time so that i can listen to my child 's upset about leaving we don 't have to just run roughshod over everything and shove him in the car and you know put him in the car seat and get going we will have to do that sometimes but there 's probably time in the week where you could actually take things slower and be able to actually listen to your child through their sadness about you leaving and that will really help them so we can plan and then the first step is to build is to really thoroughly build a child 's sense of being connected to us that 's what builds emotional safety that 's what means they can have a big upset and a big sadness because in their right in their middle they know we 're on their side and and special times a fantastic way to build connection so we build safety with special time and it means a child can carry the gift of our love with them when we 're we say to a child i 'll do whatever you want to do and we do our very best to be super pleased with whatever they want to do sometimes i want to do things we won 't want to do and um so there 's a few rules about special time some guidelines that help make it work special time if we were in a group together and i could get feedback from you i would ask you what what do you do what are the rituals in your family what are the things that you do which which where you can tell you 're connected and you know most families have some it might be dinner time a common one is you know snuggling up in bed at night and reading a book so we we have we already have places where we dedicate ourselves to being with our kids but special times slightly different because what we do in special time is we do what they want to do because it it 's such a relief for a child to have us enthusiastically do what they want we 're on their side and that 's what makes it possible then to um set a limit whenever we set a limit we 're going by almost by definition we 're going against our children we 're we 're asking them to do something or we 're insisting that we 're going to do something they don 't want so when we 're leaving and they don 't want us to leave that 's a limit and those limits go better the process goes better if in their heart of hearts when we have to counter them when we have to bring a limit they know that we are on their side and special time is the best way it works best with younger children kids under about 10 or 12 it shifts a bit once you 've got older children um you know probably most of you have got quite young children so um you know if you want to know a bit more about what happens as they get older but it 's slightly trickier but with little ones it works an absolute treat so um it have more than one adult but definitely just one child each of your children needs a a super highway into you and into your heart and in fact you know a lot of difficulties that siblings have with each other is really to do with their sense of connection to you so doing special time with each of your children will make a huge difference one of the things you may need to spend some time on in in you know in your listening partnership or where you get to work out and make plans for your parenting is how you 're going to manage if you have more than one child but it 's one child and you set a timer you you have a it 's a set time five minutes 10 minutes 15 minutes i wouldn 't go longer than an hour it 's it 's almost impossible to continue going your child 's way if you spend too long at it and and you want this to be a time where you 're really going your child 's way and you bring you you announce it time what would you like to do and then you just bring extra warmth and eye contact and enthusiasm to whatever they want to do if you can if you if if the play ends up bringing laughter up that 's a good thing but um you don 't want to make fun of them and you don 't want to tickle tickling um doesn 't put children in charge and special time is where a child gets to be in charge that balances you know the 90 of the time or 95 percent of the time where they 're not in charge where they 're little or younger smaller and they just have to do whatever 's happening for them to be able to manage all of that well a space where you 're really going their way will make a really big difference and in special time we 're not teaching don 't teach it 's their agenda so don 't give them advice don 't give them instructions pay warm attention to them if they 're figuring out how to do something or they 're struggling to your confidence and they 're using your warmth to figure something out for themselves they 're being told what to do all the time it doesn 't help so they need a space where you 're on their side and you 're just lending them your your warmth and connection while they figure it out for themselves the other thing about special time is that it 's not conditional so i it 's not i won 't_''_3246.88 i 'll give you special time if you put your clothes away or if you do your homework in fact homework 's a great example of where if you did special time for 10 minutes when they first got home the homework may actually go a whole lot easier because they feel connected after a day away from you because they 've been at school where it 's really they don 't get to choose what they want to do they 're sort of full up to here so special times great for front ending spots in your week where you often have trouble so it 's a great thing to do when to do some special time really fill their cup of connection so once we 've done some special time um what we want to do is set up the possibility of separating so ideally we want to do this when we 've got to listen so this is a bit where we 're going to listen to them and this is called the long goodbye this is where you need to figure out where you 've got time to actually listen i know this may sound weird but um we did this a lot of my husband and i with my daughter on sunday mornings when i did not have to leave at all um so we had time so we would start and i i i 'll run through it and then i 'll tell you what we did but basically the long goodbye is where we propose we slow the separation down the process down we start with as as gentle a reminder to our child that we 're going to leave so usually that 's a proposal so when we were doing work through this with my she was about 18 months we had to do a whole pile of it we did bits before but um just saying mommy 's gonna go tomorrow morning to go out you know you don 't need to explain very much five words or less is what we say once you 're trying to provide a whole lot of explanation you 're into a different process what we want to do here is help your child unload their feelings about you leaving once you start to use a lot of words what you 're actually trying to do is get their rational mind to understand so sweetheart don 't feel sad because you know i 'm only going to go away for a little while well you 're trying to get their thinking mind to understand something but they 're flooded with feelings if you can just listen to their feelings about you going then they 'll be able to handle it easily so you propose to leave sweetheart i have to leave i care about you you 're completely safe i 'll always come back to you um you come with me i mean you can do that sometimes but you won 't get to those feelings if that 's what you do um or you know if other ways we try and fix it you know oh well you can have an ice cream you know while mummy 's gone or you can watch your favorite tv pro i mean there 's room for getting by parenting is one big process of getting by but to really handle and and help your child through the feelings about you leaving which are getting in their way you 're going to need to spend some time actually letting them have those feelings so the first thing is to propose it and not fix it and listen to their weight expect them to be upset if you 've set it up right you 've done some special time they feel really well connected to you then you propose to leave they will start to feel upset upsets are the pathway to cooperation they 're actually not a sign that they 're resisting they 're just having some feelings about it and will get to a point where if if what you 're proposing is reasonable they will get to a point where they can cooperate with it so you listen for as long as you can so my husband and i did quite a bit of this it was helpful that he was on board i would say sweetheart i 'm going to leave i 'm going to give you to your daddy and and when we first started that was enough that was all she needed daddy and poor dad not wanting warning when one parent it 's quite actually quite complex it 's actually not it 's a it 's kind of a mixture of things to do with feelings of separation from you and not being quite close enough to dad and whatever but it 's all feelings that can be that can be got through so so i would just sweetheart i am yeah i will go in a little while you 'll be his dad he loves you and then you know then we would get to a point where she would be comfortable about being is i would i remember this really clearly i would go to my bag and get the car keys out and she was only 18 months old but she knew kids are really smart she knew that meant i really was gonna leave and so the next step was just to do the next thing that would help her feel the separation and i remember it being getting the car keys so i wouldn 't i wouldn 't have to actually leave at that point i just get the car keys i 'm gonna leave sweetheart and then wait and listen so you can stretch it out as she sort of stops being upset on that spot you take a step towards the door sweetheart i 'm going to leave it 's a very similar process with dealing with sleep issues sleep issues are actually often separation issues that children experience sleep as a separation and so i 'm going to leave the room can be the long goodbye as you slowly leave the room not to try and get them used to you not being there but to provide to be separating from you and as they feel each piece they can cope with being further away from you when a child um you know you 'll have had the experience where a child 's really upset and you you you bring them to you what happens then almost always is they stop crying and we think oh the upset 's gone away but it hasn 't it 's just gone underground because they can 't feel it anymore when a child 's on top of you they actually can 't feel the separation so you might need to move them away a little bit sweetheart i am going to go just sometimes it doesn 't take much at all but if they 're if they 're glommed on to you they 're actually not like i mean it makes sense they 're not separated from you it may be enough to propose sweetheart i am going to give you to your dad i am going to leave you with so and so i 'm gonna take where i 'm gonna i 'm gonna go now um but if often it it actually stops the feelings um and the thing to say about this is you know if you get sick of it if you get tired of listening to them that 's fine stop go do something else change your plans we change our plans all the time we worry about consistency as parents and you know the reality is our kids are really used to us changing plans without well half the time we don 't even notice that we 've done it it 's okay to stop when you 've had enough every little bit that you can listen to your child be upset about you leaving will drain the cup and you 'll find at some point suddenly it 's easy it won 't necessarily stay easy but for a period it 'll be easy it 's like all those hard feelings about leaving and separating um have been drained and now they can function so we call this process stay listening so when our kids are upset we can we we can move close we can make it safe so sometimes when they 're things or thrash around or try and hit us you know we need to get them in close enough that they can 't in their upset do any damage to themselves or us or other people we want to make time and space for this to happen propose to leave tell them that we will always come back and remember that the upset that they 're feeling the crying the tantruming the raging all of those loud words they are the healing process and stopping them does not stop the hurt it stops the healing process so once you 've done that you can leave and [Music] i i do recommend that you find your way to my website and watch a little video about leaving your child at preschool very briefly children we often feel reluctant to leave our kids because they 're going to be upset what often happens is if you leave and then you ring up preschool they 'll say oh she 's fine she 's playing with the other kids you know and it 's like what 's happened is your child felt big feelings leave but when you leave it 's there 's two things happen it 's either not safe for them to stay with those big feelings because there 's really no one there to listen or um and really they 're able to pull that put those feelings away and put their attention on interesting things that are happening at daycare or whatever so you 'll ring up and they 'll be perfectly happy but but it looked like they were going to die when you left when you 're about to leave if you hang around in an environment where they can 't have that big upset what happens is they can 't engage with what 's going to happen with the interesting things that are happening where you 're leaving them they are preoccupied with the fact that you 're going to leave so it 's a kind of holding pattern they 're not able to have any big feelings about you leaving because the environment 's really not one that that would make that safe but they can 't actually get on with what they need to get to do some special time before you get there so the connection cup 's full you might have a little ritual but then leave if they 've got a backpack full of feelings about you leaving you and they can find a time where you 've got the time and where it 's safe for them to have a big upset it 's not that um it 's not that child carers are mean but i i worked as a child carer for a while and when you 've got a lot of kids you it 's very difficult to pay close attention to one child 's upsets you 're really you 're at safety manager level there 's really not a lot of space to be dealing with a big upset and often upsets are contagious so other kids will be getting upset and that 's just very hard to handle given the ratio of of adults to children in those kinds of care environments so you want to try and set it up to happen at a different time when you 've got time to listen so you can reconnect so you might do some special time which is a really efficient way to reconnect um and what may happen is your child funds if they 're not sort of if it 's not clearly about separating if they 've got some big feelings about the fact that you 've been away and they 've been away from you they may find all sorts of little things to get upset about and if you can remember this is this is my child trying to find a way to offload some feelings that are getting in their way of enjoying life you can actually enjoy what i call the special gift of little heartbreaks that you know sippy cup that 's the wrong color that toy that they really want that their sister 's got that jumper that 's um you know the wrong one um [Music] that sandwich which is cut wrong these shoes which they can 't get on their feet any number of little things they might find to get upset about those are actually opportunities if they happen at a time when you 've got if you can take the time to listen and know they may be about the separation but they 're also um quite possibly about any number of of things they 've been carrying around in their emotional backpack sometimes they 'll give you a little hint you know they 'll say something in the middle of it all that you think oh that 's what that 's about but a lot of the time you really don 't have any idea but remember a story about how little upsets are about something big um a friend of mine was having um her daughter was struggling to get to sleep and they were doing a process of of um proposing that her daughter be sleeping alone and moving away slowly and waiting for the upset to come up and um suddenly the girl said i 've got a bee sting i 've got a bee sting on my hand in the middle of her upset and her mum and she pointed this particular spot on her hand and her mum remembered that when she was a baby she had a she had real trouble finding the vein um and this child was you know that the upset about sleeping on her own had sort of was um connected to that early frightening experience of having something put into her hand and you know because the mum knew the back story um she could you know she had an inkling what it was about but i think any time a child 's having a big upset it 's about something i remember once doing some special time with a young friend of mine and his mum and we 're out in the park and suddenly he 's saying the ads you 've got to get away from and when you do special time you do whatever they want so it 's mum and i are getting away from the ants and jumping on the table and jumping on the chest to get away from the ants and and i just thought i didn 't you know i didn 't know him that well and you know oh well you know he 's getting us to i don 't know what he 's what you do with special time and we 're being enthusiastic playmates and he 's getting to work on something afterwards his mum told me that the first time his dad took him out went just after he 'd started walking they 'd gone to the park and he 'd stood in an ant 's nest it 's like our children are looking for ways to work on what 's happened to them and how they feel about it so he was the game he was playing in special time was about working through that experience of having been bitten by a whole bunch of bull ants very early in his life anyway i don 't know if it 's connected to anything but it illustrates their general point which is that the upsets our children have and the things that they explore in special time where they 're the ones in charge are about what they 're carrying in their emotional backpack so that 's what i have to say today um i don 't know whether or not um anita has any questions someone did ask about covid them say that the extra connection that we had um school at home was hard for most parents i 've got a whole spiel i could give you about that um but one of the upsides of it was that we spent a lot more time together and so we need to expect that our children will have feelings about separating from us when when we start to go out of lockdown and back to school and back to sort of more separation so it 's um there 's nothing wrong with that it 's just that the extra connection that came if we were lucky that came with covert it was one of the surprising things that i really loved the extra connection means that they will feel more acutely and feel more deeply the separation when it comes and again knowing that you can plan for that take a bit more time over your goodbyes know that every time you listen to a big sob about you leaving and what looks like a complete desperation about being without you is draining that backpack so that they can um thing i didn 't get to say they did some scientists did some research kids need to leave you they need to leave you they did some research where they measured children 's cortisol levels and they measured them before their parents left and then they measured them after their parents came back and the children i forget how this goes but basically the children whose pa their cortisol levels their measures of stress were lower in those kids whose parents had gone and come back than in those children whose parents hadn 't left at all that there 's something deeply reassuring to children about knowing they can get through an experience of being away from you it 's deeply reassuring to have you go and to have you come back and for they might have some feelings about it but for that all to be okay and to not leave is actually to do your really do your childhood disservice what you want to do is figure out how to listen to them in those places where they 're upset so do stay in touch with me i resources you 're welcome to have a chat with me about what 's going on in your particular household and anita and i have cooked up some plans um do you want to talk about these anita well um i 'd just like to say how good it is to hear you speak um i 'm surprised that my children have grown up to be 23 and 21 because i think now listening to you i think i 've done almost everything wrong oh i didn 't talk about that we always feel bad still have grown up so uh i think you know we we do our best we do i think you know i 've gotten out of your your talk today and um we keep on trying we have got some future webinars we 'd love you to join us if you would like to and you have time they deal with issues of sleep a lot of parents have issues about getting their children to sleep in their own bed getting them to sleep at a reasonable time staying in their beds so it 's time also starting school with ease there 's a bit of a talk about that on saturday the 5th of september if you do know of any of your friends or family members that would need some extra support uh in these areas don 't hesitate to share with them the emails that we will send also setting limits wednesday the 21st so as you see some of those are in the evening the day and on a saturday to help with those people you might want to um you know invite your your partners or your um your relatives to come along your cousin or whoever it may be your sister or your brother to come along on the weekend and have if they 've got those issues or in the evenings uh as i said this webinar will be made available to you all after the session is finished um we encourage you also to share this uh if you feel that it would be of help to others um i um i did put a question in the chat saying you know does that mean that we all we want the children to have a meltdown luckily okay i 'm just looking forward to [Laughter] it shows you that even in this situation where i did everything clearly backwards they do grow up and they still are lovely people perhaps you did way more right than you think well it 's good it 's i 'm glad that um allah has asked a question um about her seven-year-old son he usually gets afraid of the idea of losing her if if she died and this actually confuses her as she wants to assure him that she 's going to be here for him but on some hand she can 't guarantee that she 'll be there forever so what if something happened and he found himself alone can we also have some details about the setting limits webinar yes okay let shall i talk a little bit about that please do i always had the same dilemma um i think you have to say i will if i possibly can i will always come back to you i will always come back to you and it 's like a chance to be sad about normal separations if he 's bringing up stuff about you 'll die it 's an it 's just a sign that he 's got he 's got worries about um he 's got worries that you need to handle um most if a child 's not carrying anxiety they won 't be preoccupied with whether you 're going to die or not so we get worried when we hear a child saying that um because it scares us to think that we might not be able to guarantee you know that we will always be here but that 's a distraction in a way it 's like actually he 's just saying i 'm scared and all you need to do is find a way to listen to him in that place where he 's scared so he may be saying i 'm worried you 're gonna die so i i will always i will always do my very best to come back to you sweetheart i 'm right here now i 'm right here now honey i 'm right here now and then confident that listening to him when you do have little separations is draining that more general anxiety about whether you 're always going to be there that that because it scares us we get we we worry about it and we want to reassure him i think the reassurance is i will i will always do my best to come back to you you know if you had to be creative around it 's like and i will always make sure there will be people with you who love you and care about you that 's what he needs to hear plus he needs to offload that fear that just sort of reassurance you just have to focus on he 's telling you that he 's carrying fear and and every chance you can get to work with him and separations are just a very easy way to help a child work on fear because they 're really easy to set up all you have to do you know you don 't have to take him on a frightening um you know one of those things i 've never been do anything terribly frightening you just need to propose to leave and your child if you 've worn things up and you 're well connected he can notice the leaving and and make time to to let him actually have those feelings my guess is that his worries about you dying will pass the other thing about worries about dying our chat there 's a reasonable chance he 's seen something heard something watched something that 's got that 's got that 's emotionally more complex than he 's ready to handle we we do want to be pretty careful especially the news is is having that that kind of information on where young children can hear it because they don 't have an they don 't have a way of putting it in context in the way that we do it 's just frightening and a lot of it just is unnecessary like really do you need to know that someone in queensland stabbed someone else you know it 's like that it 's just it 's frightening so my guess with a child who 's saying that is been exposed to the idea of death in a way that they haven 't been able to process and again we can 't protect our children from everything we can do our best i think it 's a good idea to turn off the news it 's not a useful thing for young people to see but if something does go in he will show you he will show you by saying i 'm worried you 're going to die mummy or he will show you if you do special time if a child 's got a really big preoccupation with something like that what happens in special time is they 'll set up games that are around the theme of it so very commonly children who 've had lots of medical experiences when they 're young they 're very kind it 's really handy to have a doctor 's kit you know a play doctor 's kit around with little children and if you do special time there 's doctors kid around and a kid 's been through traumatic medical experiences they will want to play doctors and the that 's going to help them recover is what they 'll want to do if you 're willing they 'll want to doctor you they 'll want to be the doctor and and do stuff to you what 's happening there is that they 're shifting from having been the victim having been in an experience where something was done to them to shifting with play to a place where they 're doing it to somebody else and that is a healing process so if your child 's saying stuff about death then maybe they 've seen something or heard something um or they have a sadness about someone dying and play special time in particular where you 're watching for what they 've what agenda they set and what they really want to play so that 's one of the reasons in special time you don 't make suggestions oh would you i know you like to play this would you like to play this what you 're looking for is for them to surprise you with their own proposal which could be just ordinary but it may be carrying tension about so yeah don 't get put off by the seriousness of the topic it 's just a fear and you can help them with it that 's a great answer thank you madeleine does anybody else have any questions that they 'd like to ask madeleine um that was a good one um that was a good one um is there anybody else that would like to ask any specific questions and just remember that [Music] madeleine has offered a 20-minute consultation after the um the session if you book in a time with her she can have a chat with you if you do want to talk about anything a little bit more in depth um she can do that with you um but i think you 've done a great job madeleine um it certainly explained things to me very clearly um i still can 't get over the fact that we need to sort of make a space for these outbursts i 've always sort of tried to will them away and pat them away as you said you know getting them close to that they don 't have these outbursts but it is it makes sense to me now that what you 're saying is that we give them space in a loving way with connection to process these feelings in a safe place away from the possibly the time that we do have to get to work or go to the shopping or go to the doctors or wherever that we have a safe uh time that we can actually put into this um yeah i think that that 's been a that 's been a great learning for me um we will send out a a questionnaire or a survey just to ask you what you think and if there 's any other topics you might be interested in um is there anything specific you 'd like to say about the limit setting i actually wanted to know a bit more about the limit setting that that webinar what what you would like what you would be going into in that webinar um it 's not i 've just got rid of the screens but oh it 's just about i know i 'm j i just got rid of the screen so now we 've got a lot of names [Laughter] um pretty well any parenting challenge so sleep um um [Music] separation sibling rivalries aggression pretty much any place where our child is doing something where we need to try and get them to do something different it 's all about limit setting it 's like they 've got a feeling that 's driving them and it 's driving them off track and so then we are going to need to do something um to interrupt that the the trouble is that we we tend to think that what 's happened when a child is doing something where we need to set a limit this is assuming that we 're not being mean and unreasonable like gotta check that but if if if the limit is reasonable sweetheart you need to go to bed now it 's time for bed honey you do have to eat vegetables no we can 't play any longer we 're gonna go so you know so long as the limit that you 're we think that the reason they 're off track is because they don 't have enough information and we try and give them more information um and the trouble is they 're already off track their their thinking mind is not engaged they 've got a whole bunch of feelings going on which is why they can 't do why they can 't stand the look of the pee why it 's too scary for them to sleep on their own fair enough telling them that they 're safe won 't necessarily help there because you 're asking them to think about safety but they 're actually feeling really unsafe on their own in their bedroom so what we need to do when we set a limit is expect an upset the upset is the feeling that 's making it hard for her to sleep on her own at night and if we can listen to that upset so the upset about you leaving is the feeling that 's getting in the way of being able to toddle off happily and play in the sandpit with his mates if we it will be drained and then they can do what needs to be done sometimes it 's quick sometimes it takes a few goes can i ask you madeline yeah i 'm wondering because it 's can be um oppo x ax7 um that was the name of one of our participants tonight was saying that um she thinks it makes us uncomfortable in dealing with the outburst when it happens like there 's a there 's a discomfort for a parent to hear almost in sight a situation whereby the child we know will experience such pain um and that would that we 'd want to resolve it as quickly as possible let alone let alone set it up yeah yeah it 's a very different way of dealing with things and the re there 's reasons for why we feel that way um there 's two major reasons one is that no one listened to us so when our kids get upset our brain goes back to find out what we know about it and what and what we what we pull up is is all our own feel extreme it 's like i must stop this child crying and sometimes that 's about some big feeling we 're having which has been pulled up by our child 's upset and sometimes as parents we can we we get so we can 't really tell the difference we can 't tell what 's our child 's issue and our own issue so when my daughter started school um i walked into the school ground and i was just i was just overwhelmed with this extreme feeling that i was completely surprised by and um when i and i i was very anxious about how her school transition to school experience was gonna go well it turned out sometimes we don 't remember the things that are biggest in our own experience i i had a number of listening partnerships were just working on that feeling i had just real stress walking into school ground it turned out my parents i mean i sort of knew this i just didn 't know its significance my parents had gone to live in switzerland where we didn 't speak the language year that i i ended up that year doing um school of the air you know by correspondence but that all that intense stress it was incredibly stressful experience at the point that somehow my daughter starting school just brought that up that 's an extreme version of it but that 's what happens to us so that 's why we need to go somewhere and have some have other parents we can do listening partnerships with where we can talk about how we feel so one of the problems is our feelings get pulled up and then the other one is just that we 've been taught that to stop the feeling to stop the the expression of the feeling is to stop the feeling so if you if you stop crying you won 't be sad you you 're not feeling grief anymore or if you stop having a tantrum you 're not frustrated anymore and that 's a very common sort of misunderstanding um but if you stop the crying you stop the process of releasing the grief so the grief just sits there and waits for there and waits for the next opportunity um that said interesting yeah that said we you know there 's a lot we 're experts at diverting distracting avoiding and and that you know it 's kind of that 's necessary at times but if we do that every time we leave our kids with this big backpack and they 're looking for a hand well again madeline winter it 's been wonderful to have you on tonight um thank you for sharing your insights and your training and your experience with us we look forward to the future webinars we have planned um thank you everyone for joining us tonight we i sincerely hope that this has helped in some way uh i 'd be very interested to know if uh if you do put it into practice how it goes yeah i 'd love to hear yeah yeah and um if if you wanted to call or email madeline she has given her um email address or i can send it with the resources and the and the recording after this webinar so i wish you all well be us thank you thank you bye bye _"

    "text": "hey everybody my name is Juke thank you so much for joining me here tonight on canopy banks towns council TV CB TV it 's awesome to be a part of this and it 's really nice to see a council supporting local talents and people who wants to make music for this interesting and strange times for everyone really it 's interesting you could be watching this from Canterbury and Bankstown are from Sydney or from Port Macquarie or from Norway or wherever you could watch anywhere because of the internet it 's awesome but it 's it 's really nice that someone is supporting the idea of putting music out there even if you can 't make it perform the way we normally do in fact it 's really strange for me to be in a space all by myself here to play music it 's nice for rehearsing and stuff but it 's a different vibe when you 're trying to perform I guess some music so to all musicians and others who do performance arts of any kind out there you know I 'll salute you me myself to play some of my songs it 's Saturday night but I 'm not gonna go hard into the party mode I 'm gonna go a bit more acoustic EEZ hope you don 't mind feel free to put it in the background if you want to oh you know got a cup of tea and snag up any pajamas and just join me for a few songs this first song is actually called on my own it 's yeah the story is an interesting one it 's bit of a love story but also a bit of the old I don 't know if I want to be with you or not with you I don 't know it seems like a nice not a very nice theme but I don 't know I have a listen to see if you can relate to this on somehow if you can I 'm sorry and if you can 't I don 't know that even means anyway on my own my name is Chu ka girl thanks for being me [Music] SW this in this world [Music] shining oh it 's pretty sad we have to cheer for yourself hopefully one person at home and even a golfclap I 'd be stoked on it so thank you thank you to the golf clapper out there who helped me out that time alright so the thing is I often rely on banter as you can probably tell cuz I talk a lot so this next song you may also pick up on a bit of an accent I 'm from Norway I came to Australia 20 years ago so mm and just got stuck here you know it happens love it amazing place to be stuck to anyone at home who might happen to come across this on the Internet as well hello hello hi son hotter hotter bar awaiting is a weird interesting language for those who don 't speak it this next song is something I wrote many many years back and I wrote a song about arriving in Australia how I loved being here finding my new some new feet you know and a whole new journey experience things so I have a little sip or amazingly grammatically awesome in English but they work for me really well when I got to the chorus I couldn 't quite work up the lyrics I had a friend my name is my friend my name a friend of mine called Zach who it 's normally quite a lyrical genius in many many ways a little bit of help of this and he can opener to this forest offline it 's very strange you can do with those lyrics whatever you want takes you you can make makeup the more you think [Music] now [Music] footsteps tang [Music] wandering yes 20 is letter the answers most likely No [Music] guys normally sound I forgot a reverb before my tuba sound the master reserve Adam are true by effects [Music] yes that one weird little shooting if you 're still watching this thank you it 's amazing just nice to perform to let whomever you are I hope you have an awesome day I hope you having an awesome night I hope you just in general are having an awesome life and it 's been a very strange time for not very good at that sound he might shoot down here [Music] it 's been really with a strange time 20 has gone on forever hasn 't it just like it just feels so odd at the time can [Music] I stopped myself me to talk them 22 when it 's been a strange time we 've the only good thing is that we 've all been in it not even just us in Australia or maybe the whole planet you know we dodged a massive bullet in Australia so lucky and I 'm so glad and I hope it lasts this way cheers to that but also come with a chance to add lots of thoughts and care going out to so many so many so many people affected by what 's been happening and also with all different things I want to get to political in this because I 'm just playing a gig here but man educate yourself as much as you can on topics that you feel like sneaking off about but that makes sense I don 't know why went on that tangent tuning guitars I was walking I can 't remember exactly where I was but I was just wondering some streets and I saw a building that someone had done some tagging on I 'm on a bit of good tag if it 's good and someone had just written the words dare to dream this is like 15 16 years ago probably I saw it and it just stuck with me I just thought that 's an awesome sentiment really nice way to think and yeah went home and I wrote the song about it and it made it quite a bit just talking to to anyone I 'm probably talking to myself in fact most of these songs is really like a diary it 's me speaking to myself but also to anyone else who would care to listen such as yourself dare to dream how to enjoy this when it 's a quiet one so grab a cup of tea in the Dickey [Music] dare to dream differently [Music] I bet you 're tired of fighting any gonna take a rest [Music] and this is what [Music] the best [Music] acoustics in the guitar oh I feel this microphone and slid down this you guys just watch that go let 's just dampen the node so much I 'm gonna flip this up again here we go hope for that 's a little bit better okay I got to back up again no more weird banter from the jus if you do like my songs thank you so much first of all if you do and if you 're listening and think they did my songs please go to band camp Oh anywhere else you stream your music if you want to let 's go to file whatever and look up the Duke of Arlington that 's not Duke Ellington I wish it was Duke Ellington because he was amazing the Duke of Arlington e RL IMG perfuming I might even be tagged in this post so click on that find the music and then you can hear it with a full band which you know is really nice you can actually get to hear all the other instrumentation that 's in my head when I playing this songs that be I 'd be flattered if you wanted to go have a listen thank you so much next song is speaking of Norway I don 't know if you ever have had a long-distance relationship I did once from Australia to Norway now that 's practically as long as a long-distance relationship on planet earth can be before you on your way back again around the other way so unless you were on the moon or beyond I think I 've kind of got the record sorry anyway it didn 't work out I could tell that much but it doesn 't matter she ended up with the awesome guy that 's a really good friend of mine and they are really happy I think so anyway this song was written in that situation and it 's probably the most simplistic lyrical content I 've ever written I 'm gonna give you a chance to guess them guess what the word is in the middle of the song I 'm gonna stop and say how about that one I 'm just not say it I 'm presuming you 're gonna called miss you simple as that [Music] was out to all those lovebirds who I 'm up together tonight we were put in a request on Juke FMC btv Canterbury banks down thank you for watching and listening everybody and here comes miss you to all those lovers oh I miss you more than anything I 've had it 's supposed to make me happy but this makes me so oh I miss you more than anything and today I wants to call you but I 'm wasted yeah way I 'm waiting here for you but there 's no [Music] oh I miss you more than anything but it 's not us if you 're gone now I just miss you [Music] [Music] I bet you guessed that word and to all those missing lovebirds out there I 'm sorry I can feel for you I felt that one oh right in there all right let 's be like in the feelings man I 'm not bandits just on fire if it was just up to me I 'd have canned laughter applause I 'd have it all just against seafoam capable if you 're still here you probably should doubt just then I 'm sorry that 's what I do very strange to try this anyone who hasn 't done this should try to just put a camera in front of themselves and just play a gig and talk as if someone is watching it 's a really interesting experience so cheers to those who tried it and those who have done it and for those who haven 't try it you know it 's very interesting mm-hmm okay feelings we all have him you know that I once went to a darker place just felt really I don 't know like I really was changing in my mind and things I was worrying about and thinking about and a lot of the emotions so I had that I didn 't like I 'd suppress them or push them aside of want to deal with them later or just ignore them you know I still do it to this day but I wrote this song to remind myself not to to whatever feeling I do have to have it and really acknowledge that it 's happening and yeah just not not ignoring it so these are just the basics of the two feelings love and hate but I guess it goes for any emotion within reason feel it I mean don 't hurt anybody if you feel rage you know control it and put it somewhere it should be but don 't suppress it you need to feel it if they need to go and scream into a pillow or whatever just let that out you know get it out of your system this summer 's call feel it all [Music] love is such a funny feeling someone [Music] sometime to realign arrow surround so to take some time to myself along [Music] casually put their arms around so if you baby just close your eyes they do it the [Music] just be it all [Music] Hey it 's such a frightening feeling our you know hate hated someone else too we had it also surrounds me so [Music] always must [Music] oh I complained about a wine where are my friends I just need your arms around by fire [Music] Oh feel it old cool thank you very fairly kind of song thank you thanks to you claps

[Music] need to go listen to the actual recording on that song if you want to know it that way it 'll sound at to being a bit louder cheers I 'm a southerner night whatever you 're having in your cup Cheers okay I 've got a couple of tunes left so I 'm gonna rock out now now at a gig I 'll involve the crowd at this point people well crap dissipation even though wants to hate it love it they just don 't want to do it but then afterwards when they didn 't participate I know from experience haven 't_''_2066.92 done it myself how 'd you go down I should be part of that so this is your chance you don 't even have to do it but if you were to hypothetically do what I 'm about to tell you you should film yourself on your phone doing it and then just post it below that 'll be awesome I would be so flattered and excited if you did that just say where you are and you say this is me being electric guitar so the thing is I need electric guitar in this song it 's a big guitar part in the chorus it does about this _''_2099.489 can 't play it very well on a magic guitar nor do I have an electric guitar nor do I have four hands and I 'm singing at the same time as doing that so you 're just gonna have to help me out so the best you can do although the least you can lose is imagine in your mind in the chorus yes I 'm just yelling and rocking out so I 'm gonna go to my special place for a while here rocking out for about two minutes and I hope you can join me in whatever way you prefer and this song is called man with fire and I often make a Denzel Washington joke here and most people just go huh I think this is that 's a Washington movie that has men with fire Esther title this has got nothing to do with dance or Washington or that movie but I always talk about it at this stage just to make it more confusing and you know banter there with this one here we go ready [Music] [Applause] I 'm the man with the 's the wrong pic I 'm going with the gray pick this song this song is an orange pick kind of song there we go not to be too picky I 'm a drummer really [Music] I 'm the man with the fire [Music] oh that sucks because it 's been too long I did I lost it again [Music] [Music] I 'm a man with a fee [Applause] [Music] [Music] well I can only apologize for that that was not quite what I had in mind at the start of the song maybe the orange pick was too much better my voice just found none and I was thinking with the gray pick tonight Juke but I didn 't and here we are thank you if you imagine the electric guitar or if you recorded it just post it below so at least the song is not you know too far out there I 'm exhausted how about you Thank You summer play school how are you going I 'm going great this next last last song I think is my last song Mandy I might have to up I think I wrap it up after this one Shirley you 've had enough of me talking to myself thank you again if you are this far into it you 've been with me for 40 minutes you 're a legend I cannot say thank you enough and in fact I made a note just for you it says thank you for tuning in I should have put it at the end but I thought it got this farm and you want to get out you deserve to see the note didn 't you yeah so there we go Duke Duke of Ellington you must show you at the end just in case this song is called too long long find a way out of that second long but you know if you don 't question it it just stays there it 's the most weird messed up my head was everywhere I was at my darkest way to spot but I 've wrote it I think to say what I was feeling but also just to have a song rock and just get out of my system whatever 's loud and uncomfortable this one is similar but um if you keep me on it 's not funny in the pub I played this song or any venue and I play it then I rock out as towards the end of the set and that 's how much that 's going these guys were the great or potentially you know this guy 's actually not that great and I want to get out of here in the middle of the song I just warn you now there 's a section where I just drop out and I go really quiet and that 's when he in the venue would go up everyone can hear what I 'm saying so I just normally give you know the audience a heads up in case it 's my last shooting for tonight thanks again for tuning in you can find me anywhere you stream your music the Duke of Arlington and I got a few other acts

the line I would like to step out of myself undressing something new [Music] I mean [Music] I 'm self-awareness set me free is there anyone to help me this later stars and so I 'm running this I confess to you [Music] nice I just wanna feel like [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] trust screaming that all by yourself in a room to yourself that 's not healthy but it feels good just in

's why i 've always rocking we 're in the sea you remember lights apart keeps you balanced you put your hands on your hips you look up in the air and you laugh because you 're proud nothing because you 're required give me an r r give me another r put them all together good job good job who remembers the important things started you remember it you should know this point now i 'm just doing a little bit of revision there for some of you in the back have been falling asleep but not in episodes and all that sort of stuff right so your port is your left side that 's your port remember it 's a slightly load on when you 're in ship every time you go down the harbor have a look most of it will be like that the port side that 's when they 're that 's the steering side all right star but it used to be the steering so you 'd just be larva and starving too old the viking words elaborate and starve it started skipped larvae english in that thought a bit confusing elaborate star but bit too much the same we 'll just call it port because that 's the side the ports on easy keep it simple ever since then we pirates and stuff and we sailers like to keep things simple don 't get your views like all right now today 's class all right what are we doing today 's class well many other mothers here have been saying you know why should i let my daughter watch this you know not very lazy like to be a pirate and all that you know will they really be interested but but don 't know i know it 's people think that 's not lady like this kind of activity rape and there was some people that had a bit of superstition about ladies on boats right that used to be one of the superstitions that people did she 'd like to be a pirate and serve under the black that 's one of the things we call piracy when you 're serving under the pirate flag they call the servant under the black all right so many of them did it so i 'm going to tell you a story of just a few of them just to give you a bit of a feel for it so you know pirates for all you know we can all get in there and have a bit of fun and ah steal a bit here at all you know it 's a lifestyle choice all right so first i was going to start with anne bonnie and bonnie i 've talked about her before i 'm sure right and bonnie and mary reed right they were friends old friends right and they served under captain jack rachman right fat and body was jack 's girlfriend right all right but they end up being the most bravest ones in the whole crew right they were the greatest of all of them really in fact so much so when old jack all drunk and they 're putting a badly any fight at all the only two to put up a decent fight when mary and em they were all going for it as much as they could but they were just gonna not know because jack and his crew were just useless or useless so much so that the last words that she said to him right was if you 'd fought like a man you wouldn 't have to die like a dog as he went off to the gallows so that wasn 't the best of puns but they did right you know that 's it and poor all then and mary had to go to jail for a long long time rest of the days really so who else is it another one called cutlass liz higher will the old cups oh cutlessly as well shea shea you actually move the family to america right they all moved over there to settle for all the settlers pretty much brother nerd a couple others just managed to escape from an indian attack they all got killed right so they liz she 'd had a taste for excitement she didn 't think she wanted to be just sitting at home knitting and stuff like that so she dressed up as a boy and joined the army and then she went to sea anyway the ship that she was on got captured by pirates and she had a jewel with the captain right she had a big jewel and she was so good with the cutler she won so she 'll become a member of that crew all right you don 't get the name cutlass liz but clean not being good at it right she was a great boy or two about that who else do we have when we had oh god pal gurney high they made a good name gunpowder she used to work on a culture up in the north of england right new york chair right northeast that area right and they sacked her they sacked her for no good reason so she got a bit narky at this right she get a bit narky and so she captured a police boat they had luke police boys even many years you there stealing things and gotta live in the wildlife and having a good time until some jealous male actually betrayed her right and she got rested but she was a good lasso comparagoria all right and then you had oh charlotte to berry charlotte to bury her now she she was in love with a sailor right and he had to go off to sea so she thought i 'll go with him i 'll pretend to be his brother so they shipped off together and they 're having a mighty old time being on the sea together right they got taken over by pirates they did and when they were dressed down and they go through the crew to choose who they 'll keep and where they leave and all that kind of stuff what they do the captain discovered that she was a woman right quick as a whip oh charlotte challenged him to a jewel another one and she paid him locked his head right off the crew was so impressed they made her captain right so she 'll be able to end of the ship right and she was a cat for many years she was one of the most feared pirates around and one of the most violent apparently like that she was too scarable offering that and she never lost a battle oh charlotte the berry are she 'd be a famous whole pirate lawyer all right she did good job as a pirate who else we got now oh now oh that 's it goat i 've forgotten her name now oh i 'll go on to the other one with chin she right chin she she was the most successful part ever i reckon one of the most successful pirates ever to rule the seas right chinchi she 's a chinese pirate right now chin shi that actually means the widow chin right because she 'd actually married him into a pirate family oh chin was in a pirate family right and when he died she sort of took over right and she got a little tents on side by sharing power and she was a good political person all that kind of stuff but she was which is the kind of ship they had around china right 800 of them not just junk that 's lying around they 're just different type of right you look that 'll put down there or maybe i 'll talk about that later different types of but a joke right she had 89 and about 70 000 crew all up right they were so big they ended up becoming the navy right because they were like taking all those shipping lanes and terrorizing villages and all that so much so that the people in power their enjoying her said why don 't you become the navy so she ended up finding the portuguese and the english empires for her leaving the queen dynasty right she fought against all of them on behalf of the rulers there and so much so at the end of it they gave her a pardon right and then she went out from the business of herself she gave up piracy eventually i went into the old salt trade and run in some other establishment like gambling houses and stuff like that right and made her surrounded by her family she was a very very successful woman right and all through piracy and being her opinion the great pirate queen now now well i was going to tell you it was a goat goat cody gertie i think her name was goaty gertie ah i can 't even think of what the name is this is all that goldie gertie but basically she was called goldie because she used to headbutt her victims when she was a mugger she used to be a mugger in new york right and uh she was still one of them she just pop on there like that right and then she 'd rub him and that 's how she did it but she liked to read all right she could read and she started to read and she read all the pirate stories and got all excited about it i got some of her friends and they took a ship and they went out and robbed the things and all that stuff but they weren 't very good at it which is why i probably can 't remember her name it up and went back to normal even because they just weren 't making enough money out of the seat right so you know all the romance was there but she didn 't do pirate school she didn 't know what she was doing and she ended up giving it up all right that kind of stuff now the last one i 'm gonna finish with is how wilder right how will her she you know by the name was a viking princess right haha a princess no less but being a princess she got promised to marry a danish prince called prince alf right come out of this danish prince and she said i don 't wanna wear i know princess off i never met i wanna have some adventures so she got her friends together right they dressed up and you know traveling clothes and stuff and they left and they went off on their own right they ended up hooking up with a pirate crew and not long after their captain died she ended up taking over goodness she was such a successful primary smart lass right a place tonight having great times getting booty all over the place and making a fortune and ravaging and pillaging and all that stuff you know when you 're a viking pirate girl all right so she 's having a great time rather really enjoying herself right so much so that the king of denmark went oh you need to stop this so he said his son you guessed it prince elf to go and catch her right so they end up getching together and having a huge barney 's right forward slash them everywhere and have this huge big fight backwards and falls backwards and falls backwards and forwards sometimes forward and backwards even they did it all right fought back and it was such a big barney right then oh she got respect for ralph all right she actually got respect for ralph and she ended up saying he ain 't such a bad fellow after all now i got to met him meet him and you know sword fight with him and got that out of my system we got a lot and she ended up burying all they all gave up they made peace all right they all come back had a good time so it 's a lonely little story really finish off with a romantic story of the female pirates there that kind of stuff so that 's the kind of things girls have done in the past so you know don 't be intimidated here when you think oh my little brother once did with that be a pirate you could be a pirate too you know girls can stand with that look up and be proud and laugh too that 'd be right come on glasses give me an r r give me another r [Applause] right now what else are we going to talk about last couple of things i was going to do some more expressions right you 've heard about tying up loose ends or beat at a loose end right well of course that 's a sailing term all right remember we talked about the blade pin and all that sort of stuff the ropes right you never leave lopez ropes doing all that you always go around and you tore them off otherwise you run around and you trip over them or they get wrapped around your leg and you over the side all sorts of things i want you to swing around the whim and whop your head off just oh right off rolls around the deck and your ass go no no that wasn 't a good idea i should have tied up the lost friends right so that 's where that comes from talking about the loose ends right and the next one is in the often you heard about things are in the often that means that they 're going to happen soon something 's going to happen well nothing is what you can see from the land you know you 're at the beach or whatever as far as you can see sailors used to call that the orphan i 'm doing offshore i guess but often right so you look at that everything you can see is in the often right basically if you can see a ship in the orphan it 's likely to be able to make a landfall to happen soon so that was why things that are in the office are something that happens soon right now finally i was going to sell you the old one we talked about the catanoine tales right you also and we said the cat out of the bag you know that one the cat out of the bag gnawing tails is the old whip all right the 90 whip and it 's in the bag so once you take it out of the bag you got to use it so when you let the cat out of the bag things will happen that was what that was all about right and the other one you hear a lot about cats is ain 't enough room here to swing a cat right so they 're not talking about a normal category that kind of thing no no no no no that would just be purely recreational to do that no no when they talk about getting the cat not enough room to swing the cat they mean a cat on young tails right so if you 're in a low deck you hit your back oh no i can 't do that right so you don 't want to do that okay all this whipping makes you feel good about your teachers now don 't yeah they don 't let you do all that kind of thing i don 't believe anymore so you know some things have progressed i guess all right now i think we 're pretty much at the end of this class now lessons and lads you 've all learned a little bit about other pirates have been in there right so next week next week right next week number 15. so let 's that was five fingers there and another five all right oh captain hook he 'd be lost by now wouldn 't he you know he 'd be oh he 's stopped trying to get that into 15. i don 't know how you do it you 'd just be go well maybe you say that one 's worth 10 and that one 's a 50 no that would work that would work all right i digress next week right we 're going to going to tell you about her and talk about her loins and go through how she works i think i 'll get i 'll do a few little diagrams as well i can show you the different levels the sales the different features and all that kind of stuff what was good about her and all that kind of stuff so we 'll go in depth in the life of the beatrice outed by and our users as a pirate ship all right we 've tried to touch little bits of that so get more in depth in next week 's episode on that kind of stuff so do the anatomy of the beatrice all right but for now i think we 've almost finished i think we need to do a couple of things you know like give me an r give me another put them all together and they still are right now stand like a pirate loving this guy [Applause] it 'd be totally for me to whizzle you down so you can go over that evening nap or maybe sing a shanty at your bunk all that sort of stuff next week exciting stuff but for now [Laughter] boy _"

    "text": "hi my name is maria but you probably know that or at least recognize my face from other cv connected videos so thank you for joining me today on this video what i have to present for you today is a leg workout that 's going to incorporate strength exercises that 's going to be challenging for my strength from an aerobic capacity i 'm going to use terms like anaerobic anaerobic but i 'll explain them as we go along through this demonstration so i have here my program as with any fitness program it 's always recommendable to have a little bit of a plan of what you intend to do that way you know there is a start and a finish and there 's an objective to your workout but before you begin any workout as i 've said on my other previous videos please get clearance from your doctor before you commence any fitness workout particularly if it 's your first time doing those exercises if it doesn 't feel good stop make sure you have a bottle of water a towel and a mat is you to work out but as you can see i 'm in an amazing park and i love being outdoors because it is healthy fresh air and now with the ease of covered restrictions we can be outdoors more so that 's a really good thing so in my workout i have eight exercises and if you would like a copy of this workout for today post your comments and we will see how we can get this this workout strategy out to you before we begin i want to go through a couple of the little things on the bands that i 'm going to use today these are my props now you can buy these bands at a lot of sports places i 've had mine for a long time number of years and i look after them so they serve me well there are different colors for their bands and the colors represent different strengths the yellow is the easiest of the bands in my particular selection there are different types of colors and lots of different you know varieties that you can get i 've simply you work out with bands but again you can use one color the same color it doesn 't really matter but if you are beginning to work out with bands start with the lighter color one and the easier one and build up your strength and tolerance to a a much more harder color so the yellow is the easiest followed by the red followed by the green now you can see now that as the color with the change of the color the tension increases now this is black and in this particular range of uh bands the black is the hardest and you can see quite how tough it is to get any tension there 's no slack in this band at all all right so that 's enough for the introduction i have already warmed up so before you begin this workout please make sure that you warm up so you look after your joints and your muscles and you 've had a drink of water before you start i 'm quite rugged because it is very cold out here now what i 'm going to do sure the band is above my knee i can have the band at my calves but it is ideally better above the knee because they 're larger muscle groups and you want to use those as your primary focus the driver so my workout my first exercise is a narrow to wide to wider squat so i 'm going to start with my feet parallel i 'm going to bend from the hips long straight spine tummy muscles tucked in and i 'm looking straight ahead with my chin gently tucked in hands on hips that 's fine hands behind or i 'm going to take one step i think we 've got some people watching me yes we do i have some people watch me that 's okay so i 'm going to take one step to the right and then one step back easy easy what i 'm going to start with now is going from a narrow to a wide to a wider step so from a narrow squat to a wider squat to an even wider squat let 's do that again narrow wide and wider with my squat you will see that i am pointing my toes out what we call it ten o 'clock and two o 'clock i 'll do that one more time for you narrow wide and wider so that is also really great warm-up exercise all right so let 's go to my next one my next one is traveling squat so still keeping my band on and i 'm using the black band hands on hips or hands behind long spine big breath in i 'm going to take a step out to the side now you can take two steps one step three steps four steps it 's up to you get creative if you 've got lots of room use the room if you 've got limited space one step nice wide step good so we 've worked on narrow wide and wider step and a traveling side step using our outer thumb muscles using our inner thigh muscles and using our abdominal muscles always with nice deep breaths let 's go to the next exercise i have here a plyometric jump forward squat sounds technical but this position a parallel stand i 'm going to jump forward big breath in squat and step back jump forward squat step back or jump forward jump back jump forward jump back that 's a plyometric squat jump forward why plymetric lots of energy higher intensity propulsion move burns calories number four static squat hold it simply means tension and when you add tension means your legs arms whatever muscles you 're working they 're getting a workout make sure your knees are not going past your toes and you 're sitting well into the heels the long spine looking straight ahead now probably a good time to hold this position is about 10 seconds if you want something more challenging go for about 15 20 or 30 seconds beginners maybe 10 seconds more advanced to 30 seconds cool jump squat it is really one of my favorite exercises not because i like it because it is an effective plyometric high intensity calorie burning effective exercise so you can take the band off with this exercise if you wish but i 'm going to make this a little bit more so feet parallel big breath in nice straight back tummy muscles engage and squat that 's your squat jump how many times can you do that maybe as a beginner start with a couple and build up your aerobic tolerance to that all right and we have one more exercise to do a plank to a squat a little trick in the park but not impossible so from a plank to a squat from a plank to a squat plank to a squat and there you have it really back exercises they 've been around for a very long time they stand the test of time when it comes to aerobic anaerobic fitness and strength training they serve a multitude of purposes from beginner to advanced so the question is well they 're great but i 'm a beginner so should i do them every day absolutely not use some common sense try a few at a time and build up your tolerance you 're quite fit and you 're used to these exercises and for some high repetitions i 've got a little bit of a suggestion for you of all of those exercises and say 10 repetitions building up to say six sets of 10 to 30 repetitions that 's quite a challenging workout but it 's definitely an effective workout but again if it doesn 't feel good stop bring it back to your level so you can achieve your fitness goal well i hope that was beneficial to you and you 've gained some information and some more expertise and more information to expand your library on fitness training if you have any questions please post your comments would be happy to answer any of your questions or if you 'd like the information that i 've presented to you today on this video stay safe stay connected thanks for watching this video bye for more _"

    "text": "[Applause] that be right give we 'll be here to learn all about the pressure so some of you would have already done it all right if you haven 't you want to stop the old presentation now right press the old button alright you can stop it make a map of your house or your backyard or the park around the corner right drawing little things in the landmarks right you can go off and at the end of it we 'll do a little treasure run right so i 'll read it you you do your map i 'll do my map at the end we 'll find the treasure with any luck in preparation if your parents are helping you out not going anything great but right now i 'll tell you a little bit about treasures right with all the buried treasures we all know x-max 's spot and all that kind of stuff right but what kind of things what kind of treasures and who buried them and all that kind of stuff right some of the treasures that people look for right we 're was other thing i was gonna say booty right booty 's the other word we call it in the dictionary it says booty is money and jewels taken by less than legal means that 's what the dictionary definition of booty is that 's why we like that one it 's sort of searched together like us pirate gentlemen pirates so booty or plunderer that 's the kind of thing all right we get to there right no pieces of weight and all that sort of stuff will go with that treasure or what treasures are made up of and talk about the pirates so one of you know pirate treasures the people of those legendary ones they hunt for right there 's uh oh captain kid right his treasure been found recently not too long ago all right from you guys the last 10 or 20 years if i 'm getting kids not even that far from new york right he just buried a whole pile of treasure a little island off the side a new york year old captain kid all right they found the gold bars of it right another one captain flint hill captain flint he be famous old cat inflate because his treasure be the basis for the story of treasure island have you seen treasure island as a movie or something like that if you like pirates you probably know treasure island they 're all robbie louise stevenson he did it they based it on the old captain flint and he had his treasure buried there oh hell story of the old treasure ah it was one of those treasures one of the things they used to do right one of the things they used to do with the treasure when they buried it right is they put a body in there right if somebody had a diet or a prisoner or something on top of it right so that had two purposes right one the ghost of the guy there would stay and protect the treasure right that was one thing they 'd say and then sort of make it haunted and all that and scare people away the other ones because if you somebody come not soon after you right and they it 's very there they dug down and they found a body right they think oh no it 's a grave oops sorry sorry and then put it back up and they 'd leave it alone and they wouldn 't find your treasure so that was the two reasons i used to do that right and old cam flynn he would have done that on these one there as well you know the other one we were doing that blackbeard willow pearl blackbeard we 're talking about him well he 's got a legendary charger right the people still searching for her but he 'd not be buried in the land it 'd be underneath the sea or the old queen eye and you read the queen and talk about her right how he used his flagship the queen and the big 40 gun ship 400-ton fragrance right that was a big one all right but it sunk to the bottom of the sea right and then the treasure was full of treasures also the treasure so they 're still looking for that and they say they found pieces of for that all over the place because not all the treasures you know will be buried and spent and all that stuff some got lost at sea because you know if you think about it when you take a ship at sea right you 've got to load it from one ship to the other right and you fill up the hole and so it 's harder to do when i move a deck right you go to that and you bring it stuff down and you pack it in the hole and if these ships didn 't tie it up right you know and they kind of try to get away fast and you take off and you sail away and they hit bad weather and the load shifts that could tilt the whole boat over to one side and i could flip over right and sink the ship and then they would sink and they 'd lose the traitor and all that but they reckon oh black people might have sunk at himself to come back for it later but you know he didn 't have any diving 's a feisty obligatory old blackbeard so there 's some of the pirates we talk about they bury their treasure all right but what kind of treasure do you think we had you know what kind of tragedy that we had and why would we bury it well why are we to bury it i 'll talk about that first right because we didn 't have banks right now we didn 't have banks that we could deal with that so a lot of the stuff we do take to the market and sell straight away but other stuff you know and you want to spend the money straight away but other stuff you want to stick it away for a bit all right that kind of stuff to save it for up for a later date so you buried it away if you couldn 't get a sale on it straight away or you want to come back to it because you wouldn 't want to stay in a new ship because look i haven 't_''_303.68 got a big ship you know we were little raiders we 'd run so this has only got a couple of decks right there 's the top deck here we 've got the guns and all that sort of stuff right there 's a deck in there for everybody to sleep on and then the deck down the bottom of the hole once it was full you couldn 't get any more right so you had to put it somewhere you sell it or you hide it away right so that 's what we do right so we know that but what kind of things we get okay so buddy i told you that before about the pieces of eight and hopefully where you find my treasure right we follow the map to my treasure right i 'll show you a few pieces of it so we 'd have pieces of white they 're all spanish doubloons right are they all spanish doubloon and jewelry there 'll be lots of jewelry that was a good treasure bundle we 'd like to have you know dory because that 'd sell well and you know look good we 'd wear a few things like ourselves we had was wine wine was a great treasure and we probably wouldn 't even sell that we keep it for ourselves because basically all the treasure money we get for treasure we 'd spend wine anyways we 'd probably just keep the warning for ourselves but you know saves you money in the long run you spend it on your hobbies and all that kind of stuff so that was good you know and occasionally you know the better stuff maybe would sell off under for a few merchant traders so that was a good thing cloth was another thing cloth you know because cloth was actually expensive right they used to get silk and stuff right from the east indies and they 're in china and stuff like that and so silk was worth a fortune right so you 'd see a little floss and then you take it to markets and sell it on and all that kind of stuff so you make a fortune with that so what else was there there was maps maps what what uses maps you say well let me apply you not everyone haven 't you couldn 't just go out and buy a map you had to get them right and so we they could have the trade routes on it so you could wait in ambush if you did it we talked about that with the log books and all that kind of stuff they get those i love it i remember oh captain bartholomew sharp captain bollywood sharp right he right he got this book of maps from a spanish ship right they saved his bacon in the end oh came charles the second right of england he had a huge bounty on him right he wanted his head he was like don 't i get him right he had his pirate hunters out and everything but oh captain shop he was smart right he managed to poly those maps that he got from the spanish frees freedom all right a pardon for him and all his crews all very valuable stuff to a pirate you know we could retire on his riches and not get quite getting taken away he 'd always shot an exciting life but one all captain sharp he used that with a map so that 's fairly valuable sugar was another one sugar you think what sugar just for me tea yeah well sugar is hard to produce right especially back in the old days lots of sleeves they eat sleazy like more expensive and all that kind of stuff right to bite that sugar and then they had to cut it all the way to england they 'd love their sugar right they couldn 't grow any they 're not tropical enough for them right so sugar was a great crop to get right you get that you know that all right cattle cattle was good but not so good for getting on the ship right be smelly and all that kind of stuff with that but it could feed you for a while as well so you trade it but after a while if you keep them on the ship they can get deteriorated a fair bit so you know but cattle was something that they would do and then yet the stingy pirates you know the lazy pirates didn 't like the old captain jack rackman it was a bit of a you know dandy he got dressed up and he had all the ladies around him like they used to take fishing vessels and get fish and sell the fish back and stuff like that you know so anything can be treasured all that kind of stuff but not all of that could be buried of course right you wouldn 't want to bury fish stuff like that materials you would marry the materials of clothing with a fish that 'd be just ridiculous well that ridiculous hahaha you 'd like that would ya right so we don 't do that kind of thing that 's what i did all right so they 're the kind of treasures you get when you 're a pirate all right and you take them back to market like you know people like black beard even have the city they 're all warmed up there to sell you know they 're the oil in there already you know friendly port they take it in there and they sell it to market it was right so that 's why but there 's not enough room you can see there 's not enough from that ship but later on one of the next lessons i 'm going to do a whole thing on the whole ship and i 'll give you the layout and the whole thing where everyone was and we 'll go all over that but all today is all about the treasure and we love that treasure don 't we all right is there anything else i need to tell you about the charger the load shift ah we talked about all that sort of stuff so i think it might be time to think about that treasure all right okay so what would you do if you 're burying a treasure right you need a crew and a shovel you go and drill that right thing but you 'd find yourself a landmark right you know you say oh that rocket looks like a bear i 'm gonna say all right so we 'll start there so you might possibly stay at the start of the rocket looks like a bear you get your compass out right get out your compass and you follow it around right so you are somewhere to the left and then to the right under that do all these steps and then you 'd know exactly where it was and that 'll be on your map right so if you get out your map all right and you 've got all your pieces on there so you find your lane mark right okay all right nines at the miley martial boat was right in the whole building that was in right and so you get your map there like that and you look at it and you look a compass because it says oh four places to south all right so you look at your compass two south would be that way right okay and you take your pieces that way so you know your four pieces so everybody will all do it together now four places due west west south sorry south i 've lost already hold the map upside down i guess two south ready so you go one two three four oh i i think we would do regular jets and otherwise i 'll just keep disappearing off the screen all right so i quickly just got my compass into my little little sway pouch there and i keep my compass in all right so that way we know i 'm being authentic right because i got my real little compass here right this is what i level there remember the one on the boat be in the box and all that kind of stuff be cumbersome so for the land i want my little one there and i have that my little pouch i usually have on the belt all right whenever i probably build on that sort of stuff so that 's the kind of thing you 've got you know one of the tools of the trade the whole compass all right so we 've just gone four places to the south you all got that right then it says turn to the east all right we 're turning to the east all right so this be the east this way right south north east be on your right all east is where the sun comes up so that 's a good way to remember that too right so if the sun comes up in the morning right you face the sun pretty much that way it 's going to be north if you like that all right that way got to be south behind you that 's gonna be west all right in the afternoon you 're doing the opposite thing right that 's how one way your waking working how you were roughly very roughly if you ain 't got a compass ring you can work that out okay now so oh now it says hop three times to the east up hop in ready hop hop hop hop oh right okay we 've done that right now it says pirouette four times do you know what a pirouette do you know how to pirouette i can 't eat you do you know how to feel that oil captain you see already captain [Laughter] me all patches riding up are you when you pitch right up oh that 'd be right anyway we 're pirouetting all right how so pirouette all the ballerinas out there will be able to teach you guys if you don 't know but if you do all right let 's hand up oh my god open your toes that 's it open your toes all the time well done by lads and glasses we 'll be unappointing this treasure very soon all right so we do that right now where are we on the map we 're on your check okay you 're working your way through your maps you know what you 're going to do and how hard are we going to look around make sure there 's nobody following us all right you got to be careful you never know when them dotted little brothers and sisters might be around or older brothers and sisters or parents i might get in there and want your treasure we keep it between ourselves all right all right okay now oh it says turn to the north north be that way remember north is up that way remember your compass are right up the north right and it says rivet like a frog a frog goes like this ready are you ready we 're a frog ready one two three four let 's go ah one two three four five all right we did it we riveted like a rock very good now it says go sixth pieces to the east are you ready one two three four five six very good all right now it says scuttle like a crab to the south you know how crabs go they go down and they go sideways all right so get your little pinches up got your pincers up all right everyone got the pizzas up you at the back have you got your pincer up oh i 'll be watching you with me not so good i alright me not so girl he 's trying to escape there i think it is be riding up again all right i 'm still watching him all right are you ready we 're gonna scuttle like a crab why i hold my breath for three are you ready very good all right now tap your head scratch your bottom and rub your nose all right i to slink like a snake to the northeast all right north east north east be that way all right all right that 's north that 'd be east so north east is that way right north easterly direction all right sorry we 're slinking sling very good we 're almost there right we 're almost there to the treasure we slink like a snake we 've jumped like a frog we 've walked like a hopping thing we 've done lots of all those sorts of things right ah what 's left to do what 's left to do run around in circles like a mad ancient dog all right ah that 'd be good anyone else have got dogs there just follow them around while we 're doing that that 'll check them that 'll put them off the scene all those footprints be round and round in circles they 'll never know where we 've gone to hahahaha you 've got to throw them off the scent when you 're hiding your treasure remember that ride into the treasure throw them off this end oh we 're getting take five big lengthy army type strides to the north ready one foot what two three oh four five oh we 're almost there oh now it says rub your nose ruffle your chin and beard pull your ear pointed yo it 's over here it 's over here it 's over here oh look it 'd be my treasure did you find your treasure was your treasure just there when you tried to do it oh that is so magnificent give yourselves a big haha give us another r put them all together and they spell what standard lost like a pirate very good here we have it treasure we 've got jewels haha baby earrings i guess so and look pieces of eight spanish doubloons that be it the old spanish coin slightly new value not worth what it used to be i guess but it 's still good old treasure nothing you can 't buy with a spanish doubloon ah nothing to eat anyway it 's a simple life as a pirate i gotta admit all right then but here there is lots and lots of treasure of the lesson doing it keeping the treasure and burying it there somewhere sensible all right all right you see i didn 't have any bones over mine because that 's not a noise to do i might have actually put the old first mighty still waiting to get repaired the old poor old first mate if you want to see him again you got to write on the facebook or on the thing there and say bring back the barley threats mate all right poor old wilson he 's still suffering still suffering but we found some treasure oh all right now now we 've got the treasure right last thing to talk about next week right i 'm going to talk about some female pirates higher the femme fatales then female pirates and some fancies after they did well after that i think i might talk about the old beatrice right about all the bits and pieces of the beatrice and the different levels and all that where you 'd sleep all that sort of stuff will go well everything about the beatrice right see a little history to be on deck if you 're in a boat like that right by the way he 's coupon practicing your fault skills remember you port and you starve it remember all that stuff you bow and you 're off or you 're stern for them people who don 't like calling it an art because officially it 's a stern but earth is what we want pirates like to call it because earth

it 's my five year anniversary with my partner today five years far out it 's a long time it 's a long time i mean it 's not 40 years but five years it kind of goes fast uh and yeah this song i wrote probably about a year into our relationship um maybe six months or something and it 's about the night that we met which was a couple of months before we actually got together it 's called sunrise [Music] summer wait for us to make tea keep your footsteps light and get the blanket got a real nice the city apparently on this parkour park just next to burger street there 's a million dogs like every day here now i don 't see one come on let 's run and beat the sun above the city all over the bridge and onto the field we 're just loving our words and brilliant ideas we climb up the hill there 's nobody here [Music] the city is sleeping you 're sitting so near watching grey clouds turn into kaleidoscope skies [Music] sunrise [Music] sunrise you take the chattering and the tease don 't cold up like a sheep thin i think it 's time to go and get some sleep and feel so comfortable give me a hug and take your mug back to the city or down from the bridge and onto the street there 's buses with strangers that i 'll never meet [Music] the daylight is broken and everything 's clear living in the moment can 't_''_1203.679 be always so sweet [Music] fly [Music] sunrise [Music] sunrise sunrise sunrise sunrise [Music] such a nice surprise sunrise sunrise oh yeah so we went to the top place to watch the sun come up you know um at the top of the the golf course like the gulf the driving range it 's not inside the golf course but you can walk up that big hill it 's just more park and it 's like a really nice view out over the city and it 's pretty quiet up there so um highly recommend probably shouldn 't have said that now when you all go up there all the rest of you will be up there and it 'll just be like a big crowded place hopefully not it was pretty cold when we were up there too i have to say it was like um vivid was on so maybe it was like late may or something um yeah what is shane divides not happening this year i mean what a shame lots of things aren 't happening this year i hope everyone 's been keeping um okay like mentally and physically and you know i i know a lot of people have been struggling so sometimes it 's kind of nice to just know that a it 's a tough time it 's a weird time and um yeah just got to try and like keep your head above water and look at the positive side of things i suppose um and if you 're feeling down or not great talk to someone and just let yourself not feel great you know not everyone has to be feeling amazing all the time um yeah sorry you probably you probably weren 't like wanting to hear any of that stuff um just just play some damn music and don 't talk about all the weird stuff that 's going on in the world okay all right i will i 'll keep playing music uh let 's see [Music] no i could have shown that i could give you at that time [Music] sorry i wasn 't ready to [Music] hey [Music] is [Music] i 'm sorry [Music] break it down [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] i 'm sorry [Music]

    "text": "[Music] hi i 'm mr ace pin freckle and this is exercise video number four this is called warm-ups and this is ace p freckles world of fun and fitness what are we doing oh warm-ups all right so warm-ups is when um you just want to do something you know just loosen up a little bit kind of exercises they 're perfect for when you get out of bed in the morning or um it 's just perfect perfect at any time anytime you want to warm up this is what you do okay so we 're going to get started who 's excited i am yep and we 're going to get started with some looseness we 're going to loosen up okay so then when you start with your hand you can loosen up your hands it like it all right loose up the other one and check them together shake check check check check check oh my boss i 'm shaking as well so i 'm loosing my arms you know shaking my bottom and watching there 's another it 's quite a nice spot don a leg out like this shaking one leg like this and then checking up the other leg and everything 's all shaking up and then just everything okay wow wow [Music] yeah all right so now i 'm feeling really loose it 's time to do my hips my hips this is the hip and this is also a hip and i 'm going to lift up my knees like this and just imagine that you have got a piece of chalk stuck on your knee and you 're going to make a figure eight on a blackboard still i still haven 't fallen over yet this might look easy but actually it 's really hard uh what about this one okay hangs on the hips right try this we 're gonna make circles with our hips so like this around we go like this round this way and you can go whoa as you 're doing that 's fun and then you can get grab yourself by the bottom i like to take bottom bottom grab yourself by the bottom give it a shake oh shake shake shake up shut the circle like this and that 's cool then that 's called shakes and then oh i know this is to twist the spine this is good for you so like this you go you twist around like this this way just like this twist this way and then just and then your spine is getting loose your neck is getting loose and everything 's loose your hips are loose and your spine is loose and everything 's loose and that 's pretty good uh and now the next one oh this is this is tricky you are going to have to pay attention here because this is pretty tricky we 're going to do wind builds so you put your hands up in here both hands up in the air like this and then the one hand is going to go forward and the other hand is going to go back see that you get to there see and then you keep going and this front hand comes down and the backhand comes down as well and they meet at the bottom and then they go and keep to the top again like that and then they 're there and then you do it again down and they meet at the bottom and they keep going and go up the top like this and so one arm 's going one way and the other arm is going the other way and it 's pretty confusing but after a while it feels pretty good wait a second i 'm going to show you i 'm going to turn around and do it this way so you can see what i 'm talking about hands up in the air like this and then this one goes forward and that one goes back and then they meet at the bottom and they go round and then goes up and this one goes forward and everyone goes back and then it moves at the bottom and like that you just keep on going like this oh it feels really nice and then when you get pretty good at doing it well what you can do is you go back the other way i see reverse directions like this see oh i 'm because it it gives you big muscles and it makes you lose and helps you to concentrate and if you keep doing that you 'll be rich all right now what 's next oh breathing exercises we did breathing exercises in episode one but this is advanced breathing exercises this is called the archer so uh if you start like this this is like the bow and this is the arrow and then you you line up and you pull the arrow like this and as you do that you breathe in and your chest expands as you try again yeah and then you let it go and then you do it again this side like this you go shoot the arrow and then you let it go and then you go this way you get sick of doing it and then you can do something else what 's next um oh tarzan bangs okay so um do you know what he 's a tarzan well he 's a guy that lives in the jungle that does this whacking yourself on the chest there like that that 's supposed to 's there 's that um oh okay and now it 's time for head turns right so what i 'm gonna do is i 'm gonna turn my head to the left see and now back to the center and then i 'm going to turn it to the right watch this pretty good huh well now you just have to do it again and you just keep doing that you turn it to the left turn it to the center turn it to the right turn it to the center turn it to the left turn it to the center turn it to that 's the right yeah i got confused right left now left right center and right left center oh i 'm confused anyway that 's what you do you get the idea oh i almost forgot hey hey hey that 's a good one so this is for jumping up and down exercises so what you do is you just you go you jump up and down and but at the same time you go hey hey hey like that 's pretty easy when you get like this and you go hey hey hey hey hey hey and five is about as many as i can do i 'm gonna do today anyway so that 's hey hey hey and now the last thing is eye exercises so i am going to come up we 're going to get the camera to come in close and we 're going to do eye exercises okay here we go uh go i 'm gonna move my eyes to the left like this like i 'm looking at something over there and then i 'm gonna move them back to the center and then i 'm going to move them to the right and then back to the center i forgot to breathe oh okay so that 's that one and now this is great so we 're going to start off um moving them to the left and then i 'm going to bring it back into the center and go cross out and move the one that 's on the right over to the right watch this here we go starting over here and then this one 's this one where i 'm going to make my eyes go around in circles so uh try this where you imagine there 's a mosquito up in the air and it flies over there and you look at him over there and then down there and right down there and then up there [Music] okay all right we 're going to finish off with some funny faces okay now it 's always it 's good for your face muscles to make funny faces did you know that so um let 's start with happy

merchants what they do is they travel by themselves because they figured by the time I made it to market there 'll be no competition so they 'll make more money out of that way right they go that they go cuz they 're not going with them any one 's not paying for protection and stuff so they 're by themselves right night and they have as little crew as possible they can get more ha go in right mark Rubel cago little guns are not many guns because that takes up weight right same thing too much weight you sit down right so the most place for cargo right so these greedy buggers right basically they 're doing my job for me they set themselves off but you need to have some information right how do you know what they 're gonna do right so I have spoil voice on you is right they go into the Kent towns and hang around the talons and places like that with the eleven drinkers chat down by the harbor and they get information glean information right and when we take prisons when we take a right well question them and get more information we goes internet store fire and also we know the log books right got a lot of books right where the captain and I own a fleet chose you know you shift there right after you don 't clean the slate you write it stored right so you read through them carefully sometimes ever you meet another ship so they talk about the ships it bring it in trade or a different trade route stuff that 's maybe only information of builds a picture then you get ready and you wait around there alright so you 're waiting in those spots where you know what 's gonna happen already so you 're lifting your chances of getting it right and then when you spoil it it 's funny your spoiler on there always and right you 've got your telescope there right the old smoky glass you see yeah you are alright then you probably spent a little while just peeling it great just given behind and just tagged along with it for a while and make sure it 's the right ship because you don 't want to be going in and getting the wrong one sometimes my dastardly old people would actually try and set us up all right trying to set us up but I pretended to be these traders and stuff like that and there are all these guns and him right they trying to set him up right but no no we don 't follow that we track it all and we just hi why you doing that you 're working a tactic Chinese it 's there 's different kinds of tactics you can have right you had a full-on attack and all that sort of stuff but you 're also we 're gonna slow them down you know if you 're actually he 's like shoot him for a long this is you know those cannons we thought about accounts for right right that 's how long not really accurate or distance right you can 't get sort of a pop-up on there let 's do it you know you 've heard of a long shot right long shot and that 's like when you 've betting on a horse or something like that right the long shot comes in right that 's like really lucky that comes from the old cannons as well you know if you hit a ship for a long distance away that 's a long shot right it 's a really lucky shot gateways getting in close right some of us he 's danced a little tricks you know you pretend you be weaker than you are you know like you 're hiding the crew downstairs so you get them all the dresses women talk tried half the crew down there so they go this ship 's been abandoned just the women left you know we 'll go over to talk to them you know really guys like me probably not being Uncle Tom but other ones you know they come over in it you 've got it all right or you particularly safe I get a different sick people they I and so they could get closer to you know check out and make sure you if you need help you put out sorry for help you know when you use a false flag so your flag and you 've got a pirate flag up right you got another flag up so they think you 're a friendly one ship even did a ghost ship they painted themselves all red and stuff like that because I 'll paint lying all over the and the other ship decided Oh once even I think we can use great ill or is he what you find you something and so they can go where and when they come over they took your fallback and they took that ship that way so what 's always you can do it what do we like to do is pretend I 'm a trainer because I 'm trading ship they like that with them alright so what you do is why do you want to get out you pull out with agency right but we actually put like mattresses and chains and stuff out hang them off the back of the power right all right down they are fearful is there an IV hang them and so when they look at you through this boy glass hey you see you with a full sail wind rain fall off all but you 're not going too far astray so I think oh you must be a traitor like me stroke it along there with a big load and so they don 't give you no morning right then you 're to angle it right were you gonna cut across their lawyer because they are captain thinks he 's a smart about her than you you know I 'm gonna get school slippin straight past him because I 'm on the right line with a twin that buggers opal is he 's just cutting across there he 's not getting the best point for himself and he 's you know all that old number thing all right so they cut across the front of you thinking they 're gonna split right oh by what you do has a cutting around in front of you you could remember the old couldn 't run you cut your own there all the things I 've been dragging it slowed you down and you burns forward with Spain right noose up catching them up hey can I mock you these the guns called a bow Jason 's right so you 're ready tucking right behind him the bow chases that 's a couple guns up here in the front right pointing forward you chase it there forward and you feel up full of the old ball just kind of balls right we have there we 'll have the balls and the change right so you flow you that forward and take down some monster stuff and slow them down that way you can get on drawn that way right so that 's all you can do it and then it comes to Borden all right then you got a board I mean the other way sorry the other way he was just use your marketing campaign we thought I might be an icon so we you stick your pirate flag straight up there so scary let 's go well you know often some of the parts that haven 't worked out right now because a lot of those greedy merchants would have an actual stash of money they could pay you right it 's basically a bride to leave them alone so you come up you sort of the flower you pull up there thank you up straight away then although we can 't do it you know sometimes you pretend you have lots more cans you haven 't painted on the side so look put it on all right you 're more fearsome you were and they just give up and then they would try and pay the ransom right so they pay you the ransom I like us up in your beef oh hello sort of like a GPT you know a general pirate tax so that was one way you could do it as well or you take the ship so if you 're gonna take the chute right well then you need to border right to dump the border and take over if I haven 't surrendered you got to board the ship so how do you do that there 's two sort of ways you do it one way is you pull up near him right in the big ship you main ship and remember I 'm talking about the Jolly books the big boats the rowing boats and we don 't remember that way back to where we 'd launched them right and you set off a group of crews and those it 's actually board the ship while the rest of us day the ship and cover and of stuff to keep the suppressed while you bowled over there so they would roll over and they would actually go to the bow of the ship right the after the ship is already done about confusion today point it around there they are the ship right you trip earlier the art for the shitty it 's easy to get up on the bow right if you 're coming in a smaller little rowboat so it 's easy to get the side but it 's harder to fight your way back to the bow alright just the way it all the crews all set up so we 've come into the bow it 's bit harder to get on but then it 's easy where you have forward once you 're on you walk your weight quickly in the front okay you do any fast I can be faster five spots you want to be fun so you don 't be on there too long you know the longer the metal goes worse it is for us we want to be hitting it bang over peril get them to surrender when you go and ship to ship your bang together and you throw grappling hooks all right there big ropes on enemies big metal hooks right there all Macross not trip across power they probably already government and then you hold the ship together so they hang together and then your board straight over right and when you do that you tend to go the bow the bow and here after having a good day well they are and you boom you 're waiting into the middle like that you owe me and all that kind of stuff again being careful sometimes they have nets on the Sony they put a little Gretl and nets and that 's all there to stop you from none that makes it hard to climb up and all that kind of stuff so again that 's what you 're watching when you think what kind of defenses they go up there when you 're actually playing than a lot kind of stuff so that 's what you do right and then what do you do then I hate you 've got the ship you right you sort out what you 're gonna do with a crew now sometimes you had romantic self the crew they pay ransom and then they 'll be released all right kind of that some immune actually offer have a chance to be on your ship and all that especially if you 're gonna decide to take that ship you need a cruiser so you lat so you probably all get one of them a couple of them on the board that kind of stuff or you know if you don 't want to take no prisoners all sorts of stuff you heard though I when they say was it no quarters give no quarters yet no quarter all right you how about that well the quarter right that 's the old salient thing as well as the old party all right what they used to do with the offices right when you captured an officer right they would ransom themselves off by paying a quarter of their yearly salary they would pay you that that was a corner sofa point was they say oh we offer no quarters it a quarter of your salary that 's where that comes from earlier that live in your quarters that 's what that 's about right so it 's your thing don 't know about right so what else was there okay so that was that with an encore once you 're the crew then you decide what you 're gonna do with the treasure right so sometimes you just transfer it straight onto your ship right other times you would you know maybe you decided there was too much and you would take it in the ship and you can sail back to the port together with it right now that kind of stuff but then you 're gonna decide what you 're gonna do with the the crew your ransom her back you go back to a villager the township and all that stuff and ransom looked after them you know they might be into the medicines on more they might be really needing those medicines and you go get cash for the medicines I know you trade you know all that stuff all you need for what they need but whatever yeah so I mean you have to so we want to do the ship what do we do with the ship right you can keep the ship you don 't come back be there the whole boiler ships and only me basically like think of himself as an airball arrogant what he was ie he was terrible that but you know what we say it is you don 't need that all right you really if you want to do it you know if you 've got a ships with you pretty much they know that you 've taken the ship right so what you want to do is either sinker right so we don 't want to go or just leave it float away so they don 't know what happened to it just floats away if you take it back an important but you take it back out and do that or you sell it and ransom it that 's the kind of things you can do with a ship right but you know all right so what else are we gonna talk about that Oh you know when you 're pretending you 're weaker and stuff like that right what you do is you put your crew underneath right well dick no hi mostly crews hiding below and they pop up when the others are there okay so if you heard the expression above board well that 's where that comes from okay crews when you look across you see the crew all above up there we can see what that 's when you 're above board right when you 're below when you being you know devious and stuff that 's when you 're not being above board because we 're on below the day which is the boards and that 's where that expression comes from see you learned so much all the time oh all right know what else can we cover any a few other things like what happens when we fought it on the ship I guess what to do that what kind of weapons to use right so we talked about you know with a great big child that 's awfully wet they use grenade he top things that stuff in it and gotten powder and they love that over there that was one of the ones ooh another thing we use right it was a flamin tar right so you did big blow guitar with a rope around it right as you say that close you like the tire because that burns or any burns around and you love it across into the sails burning that scares them a lot to everything fire and they 're all trying to put the fire out in the skin because say let 's be scared or fire around the boat right that 's the worst possible thing to happen because you know what are you gonna do with this just water daily but boat burns from underneath you you 're gonna be trouble alright big trouble so that 's what you do right so down that kind of stuff and then you cook this all right oh and although weapons right you put this oh yeah pestle right there multi-purpose right you see that you got the slash and down that but you also put the Cutlass bit there pistol you end right so you knew that was a talker on the head as well so you 're scarin and the other things just looking scary and scaring them so that you surrender right because that 's what you 're gonna do you want any surrender until you have it all to yourself right that 's what you get the treasure and then you go and sell it or trade it and all that passed off so you know we 're holding to ransom and all sorts of fun exciting things as our pirates that we are right so what else do we need to know about that treasures noises I don 't know what else oh one other thing we talked about the treasure is right here we don 't have buried treasure I remember Frederator remember next week right next week next week lesson we 're doing our treasure hunt remember all right remember you gotta do yourself a map all right draw yourself a map or we 'll have a proper treasure in it I talked about it types of treasures we used to get right and while that but we 'll have a proper on we 're gonna make it map of your house so your backyard or a park nearby you and we can do a big treasure up together we 'll talk about treasures and all the things in their posts be good fun all right okay now I think that might be just about it I think we 've got another stuff we call it I don 't want to keep you all too long but I think that 'll be enough but at ease class number 12 all about the prizes Putnam and out of the board the ship some what to do with them after you 've done that right so well there are y 'all_``_935.189 we it it 's been really just I sweep all theaters they don 't sail with all right now I think it 's time to adjourned and I 'll we see you back cuz we 're at the end I just heard the 8th bell and the shift all right at the end of our watch I already change your watch go to bed and I sales next week _"

    "text": "hi there my name is david coleman and for many years i 've been helping small and medium-sized businesses to grow and thrive 2020 has been a very tough year for most businesses so we 've decided to put together a six-part webinar series to assist small and medium-sized businesses to analyze what 's happened to them over this covert 19 period look at where they can make revenue immediately and plan for the short term three to 12 months on how they 're going to come back and get their businesses back on track and create so we 're into part six of react improve and prosper part one we had an overview of what was happening in in the world at this particular time and introduction to the whole series part two we concentrated on the client and the customer and driving depth around your relationship with those people part three we looked at our cash flow how it has been affected how it 's been supported what sort of benefits you can get through government subsidy at the moment and also how to spend in the next and our partners how has the pandemic affected them what has happened what have you got to do to make sure that your supply chain is secure part five we looked at our staff and our technology bringing people back to work having a mixed hybrid work environment to home life environment is your technology up to space up to speed what can we do and along those particular lines and part six to wrap it up um we have the business space and technology that we 're concentrating on so what we 're going to do here is have a look at our current space what we 're going to do to make sure that 's safe for our customer and for our employees and also to look at the technology behind that to make sure that we 've got the right sort of technology and to ask the rights of questions around that so that 's where we are today these webinars are designed to be standalone or to roll in together so we have a very similar introduction with each one however we get into the rest the first time you 've seen one of these you 'll be new and uh if you 're with us from the beginning um skip through the next few slides but code 19 has been a major disruption to all business everywhere the way we do business has changed for a lot of businesses whether you be relying on foot traffic and that foot traffic is no longer there or whether you rely on your customers to come and find and and be in your environment or be part of your environment one of the main things we 've seen with the lack of people heading into the major cbds around the country is that those people who have businesses around commuter hubs are really suffering and it 's a down the lines down the um the supply chain this has affected everybody along the way because your turnover is not the same as it once was that people supply new product and and also have less to do in their in their supply chains so very very interesting the laws and rules have changed the way we have to uh physical distancing the way we have to make sure that our customer is and our staff are clean and safe has created a whole vast range of new things for us to do as business owners so also looking at covert 19 safe plans that you need to have in place and all that situation so what we 're going to do today is analyze takes that take action and plan so when the pandemic first started we all had to run around like headless chokes and react to what was going on pivots the new word pivot to the disruption and so we did that most of us did that successfully we had to restart our business and we had to have a look at what was going on to try and create some revenue along those lines many of us in many industries didn 't get an opportunity to do that and so we shut down completely however and we 'll talk about how to bring those businesses back as we go through the day however many of us changed up food was really an interesting way to take away or even home delivery so there was a whole range of trying to keep a relationship with your customer there now that we 've sort of locked down has has ceased where we 're breaking up and getting back into more of a normal work environment or a new normal we 're going to look at how we improve what we 've got currently and take quick action to restart our businesses what sort of revenue action can you take right now and today we 're going to focus that on where we 're yeah our place at work and um the technology designed then we 're going to look at how to prosper so over these six subjects that we 've talked about how to prosper in the next three to 12 months of three to four months and what we 're going to be doing what actions to take to build so you 've got get revenue now and then what are we going to do again to change up as we go through the future so small business is the lifeblood of the australian to set up for prosperity so what you 've got to do now and what you can do now will affect your future and your ability to prosper it 's um very very challenging for many of you out there that you know your lifetimes where the work was swept away in days and your customers that you 've built up for years have now changed what they 're doing they may have to have an opportunity to purchase their product elsewhere or as we know the online world has blown up and is massive so it has created instruction disruption though creates opportunity so you as the business owner the entrepreneur that you are you 've got to use all the flexibility that you have in your in your psyche and your coordination and your persistence that enabled you to be successful in the first place to refine where you are define where you are today and to actually go out and maybe reset your business and to take advantage of the disruption and the opportunity that 's out there your customer may not be in the same position you and the opportunity might be there to take market share in your area in your business area so what we 're going to do today we 've been doing is to break down our questions into three sections the analyze section which is where is your business today what 's happened with you through uh knock down through covert and where are you today then we 're going to have a look at what items can you action right now to create some revenue to actually take um steps to just get that ball rolling and as we looked at without our budgetary questions a lot of us have put our rents back a lot of us have put up some mortgages or debt back we 've taken advantages from government subsidies we 've got a creation of some money now but that money and those benefits are running out and that little tsunami of extra debt is coming so we need to be ready for that and to to start to get some revenue happening so we can we can handle that little wave when it comes and to make or can make to grow your business in the next three to 12 months and it 's really important if you think you 're coming back can turn on your lights say business is going to occur then you need to look again the whole of the economy has pivoted and changed the way people react and move has changed and it may not be the same as when you left so you need to have some plans and that 's what we want to do with the third section is to have a number of plans in place that you can go in and say this is the type of economy an environment we 're in let 's look at this let 's look at that do we go back into lockdown what do i do better than we did before that 's where we can actually um be proactive in something like that rather than reactive which is where we 've been through covert in our analyze section so that 's what we 're going to run through today as mentioned earlier the we 've been client customer the cash flow the supply partner the staff technology and technology business space so we 're wrapping those together and that 's what we 've been looking at today in our business space and technology where we analyze recommence and enhance so what we 'll do is we 'll drive depth around each of those and ask a number of questions around each of those areas so that you as a business owner can add that to the rest of the series that you 've got so you 've got three distinct areas in your planning to do your analyze section your recommend section and your enhanced section so where are you at the moment with your public health requirements and your online capability we 've all come back but what are you where are you right now with that what are your workplace costs versus your hybrid working methods so we 'll have some time and we 'll have a look into that as well and ask some questions around what are those costs at the moment what 's happened with your you know what does the we 're going to look at the physical real estate that you 're in versus the virtual workplace can you blend can you mix can you change and so we 're going to ask those questions as well as we go through so in our analyze section and once again this is what we 're looking at where is our business today we 're going to look at three topics here health requirements your physical versus remote working overall what safety methods have you put in place in response to the pandemic that will keep your team members safe so that will drive some depth in that also how different is your workplace environment and what has legally changed do you have a coded safe plan in place for both the physical office and for those at home workers and how have you been using your real estate since the pandemic hit have you increased your eco commerce and online presence and is there new technology to assist you and what processes and practices were you using prior to covert and what have you found that 's better and how so we 're going to have a look at all that sort of situation so here we go as we 've said the whole time with the analyze create the plan whatever it may be if you 've been working with us through the whole webinar series you 'll know that we 're doing three separate plans we 're doing the analyze and re-commencing the enhanced sections so here we want you to take notes around this analyze section so you can really see across all the subjects that we 've had to look at as to where your business is today so healthy work requirements the physical versus the remote working physical distancing requirements um is the first thing so once again overall what safety methods have you put in place in response to the pandemic that will keep your team members safe and the customer how is your business managing your stuff and the customer numbers in your premises in relation to both the state and the federal government obligations if you 're not sure if you 're getting your news or your ideas from the news or the government websites the new south wales government websites and federal government websites there 's some whole big areas there on covet 19 and actually get the law down as to what you 've got to do within your particular premises and we 're talking very genetic generic generally here because we 've got we 're talking to all sorts of styles of businesses but um you need to have that understanding of what is safe for your business do you need to put in markings on your floors do you have a clear training for yourself for your teams to understand where they are if you are an office environment do you need to be moving your desks or every second desk only being used if you are face to face do you need screens for your people so find out what you do need and where it is are your sanitation processes sufficient and in line with the covered recommendations at the beginning i saw a lot of this as we 're getting a little bit more relaxed i 'm seeing less and less opportunity and less and because that is actually at the moment more so be very careful around those sort of things keep your staff up i know everybody 's getting a bit relaxed in some areas and as we can see there are spikes and things will come come back if we 're not careful do your customer facing employees need any additional ppe protection um when engaging with the clients and the customer in the workspace what is your ohs policy for your remote workers looking like at the moment have you got one for remote workers do you need to reach out to an hr professional to help you change your policy up you may have one for your in physical office space or workspace environment but what about the people back at home what if somebody has an accident whilst during work hours whilst at home how are you covered are you covered do you have policy around this these are the type of things that we really need to have a look at when we 're looking at we 've brought this under the physical location because it 's there so it 's it 's very careful to check back into your insurance policies and see what sort of cover you do have for those of you who have sales people on the road it 's a very similar thing in covering them when they 're in other people 's environments but for those of you does that cover your current workspace environment not sure have a look talk to your insurance people talk to your hr people how are you staying on top of the regulatory changes and due restrictions do you have someone feeding you information about the changes that occurring rapidly you know there can be changes very very quickly we are seeing spikes here spikes there and changes very rapidly so you need to um how are you keeping across that and what is what is going on what alternative solutions have you got for short and long term with your business space have you thought about when we 're looking into analyzing where you are now and through this pandemic period and you 've got people working remotely have you thought about how that would about how that would work if you were only partially open if you were what would happen with your people and are there other avenues for you to uh to work so you don 't have such a concentration of people in one area so really interesting questions to ask based on the health requirements versus physical and remote learning you know analyze section also looking at what how different is your workplace environment to what has legally changed do you understand your legal obligations as an employer your contractors your employees your customers your clients supply lines and any volunteers that come through depending on your business now do you have incident reporting do you have i said your oh this policy up to date have you got the right sort of risk management happening in your um in your situation in your business right now have you looked at that review that and seen that it needs to be done is your e-commerce compliant are your licenses up to date for the new explosion of e-commerce that has occurred you may need to look at your licenses to on certain areas is is your workplace considered to be safe i mean if you have government workplace inspectors come through would you be able to talk to them and and enable and show them what the changes that you 've made that the environment is safe for your people and safe for the customers and everybody else who you come in in touch with um so you 've got to make sure that the challenge we have is if any of your customers or clients don 't feel safe in that environment this could be a major challenge to you so once again you need to check on your insurances and see what is covered and what is not covered there 's a whole section of pandemics not covered well what part of this comes under pandemic and what part of this comes under normal insurance so reach back out have a look check some depth around that what processes and challenges do you have for bringing people back to work what is what do you really need people in your business for and what can be done within encourage that spacing and some of the businesses that realize that some of their employees are actually quite effective remotely while others need closer supervision or your business might be able to be spread or your business might be a hands-on business and it can 't_''_1029.839 be done so you just need to have a look at that taken a moment to see as we 've been coming out of the pandemic so we can make quick changes into what we need to do in the future how have you been using your real estate and have you increased your e-commerce and online premises really interesting subject to have a think about this one so where is your business right now is your current premises suitable um has it yeah yeah is it necessary to your new customer as we said in part two we drove depth around our customer and ourselves and our client around how to change their buying patterns and and how they may not be buying in the same way how they might be walking by your business how their entire borrowing patterns may have changed your business in the way that it was or do you need to pivot what you 're doing change up what you 're doing and maybe even look at changing the way your premise is for your premises itself can your i.t handle infrastructure handle the new increased online demand if you haven 't_''_1094.16 moved to online for your business you need to it really doesn 't matter what business it is online has taken a massive boost over the last four or five months and it 's up to us to really grab that particular new customer so many more people are now making their purchasing decisions online so how does that affect you and are you competing with your competitors to actually be a business of choice for your customer have you know great check and path three we looked at um looking at our part four actually looking at our suppliers and partners and so one of those questions that we looked at with our suppliers and partners is how have your suppliers and partners increase their online capability so if one of your suppliers have had they actually haven 't done anything then you might come out and you are moving faster than they can supply so do you need to source someone who 's up to date do you need to source someone who can help you with that on that again as i 've said be previously pushing back into your supply chain if you are part of there you will be one of their customers but if there are a majority of their other customers are no longer in operation or have shut down or they might be in one of those industries that have been really badly affected they may be under more pressure than you believe so you need to ask and understand just how secure your supply chain is because otherwise we get to the end of this year your supply chain stops you have no product so that you 're in your business stops so you need to be on the front foot with that now 's a great time to look at that because you can use their product now to create revenue but what about the future today have you accessed support packages rent deferral i mentioned earlier mortgage deferral what have you been doing for your current business where you are now and how is it going to affect your current cash flow your future cash flow so something to really analyze right now what have we done to make it easier now and when we come back and switch on our businesses to create that revenue but in the enhanced section we 'll look at what that 's going to how that 's going to affect us when we get to um further down the track and when we get to start creating some revenue in all the support packages have gone and have gone away so have you have you determined the kinds of work that remain virtual within your office and which will require to return to the office it is at a temporary basis or a permanent basis so something like that the business space and technology in the re-commence phase what items can you action now so workplace costs check back on your budgets and cash flows so we did that to reopening following the lockdown you know will you be able to bring your people back to work environment so we 're going to have a look at what is the cost to bringing them back the physical cost to you but also the physical cost to them i 'm finally talking to some of my clients that they 've got people on shorter hours they might be on three or four days a week rather than five and so they 're being paid on three or four days a week and they 're on lesser hours so at the moment yeah yeah that 's fine but now we 're asking them to come back to work we haven 't adjusted some of their hours they 're still on three or four days a week but then they 're looking at commuting costs they 're looking at commuting time rather than walking downstairs having a cup of tea sitting down at their desk and working you 're now asking them to commute two hours a day you 're asking to pay for that commute if that 's the case or that is revolved around that whether that be transport costs time costs parking costs whatever it might be and what are you doing and simply even you know the costs of going to work you 're out buying coffee you 're out buying food you 're out buying something which is great for all those other businesses but the cost to the individual in your employee goes up so how is that looking for you um and that 's what we 're talking about the cost to get that to work and also the cost to your staff what is the best for your new normal business your hybrid working methods will you be able to pivot between online and offline some of the businesses that i 've got or physical and non-physical some of the businesses that i work with they 're talking about bringing back part of their staff some days and part of their stuff the other days and they can work that really nicely they have they can keep healthy and legal in their current environment but they can keep rejuvenating their stuff by coming in not there the whole time once again depends on commuting costs because sometimes you just got to buy weekly tickets so that might not suit some people so i think we 're going to have to start talking to our staff as to what suits individuals and then from a business owner you 've got to look at whether that staff member has the ability to be successful or you need to be more involved in their business so what it 's going to help you for the new normal um and how have you supported your teams at host the technology around that so there 's some things you know looking at recommencing once again we 're looking at uh writing in our pads and and taking our notes in a separate section for recommend so you can add all the six parts together as we went first into earlier workplace costs check back to your budget and cash flow in part three excuse me do you need to upgrade your safety method message measures at home sorry in the office or at home you need to look into you need to make in your business space to recommence your business now and how much will that cost you uh can you pivot to online and remote to keep your physical costs down once again is is your do you need to consider rotation plans as we mentioned shift pattern reconfiguring workplaces i.e no desks facing each other to maximize safety remote online and shared office space as we just mentioned many of our many of our businesses are looking at having part staff on part staff of even though we can come back together just to make sure that they 're staying within the safety regulations so what have you got to do that helps you right now and also budgetary what can you afford to do as you just come back into uh out of lockdown and you start your work have a look at the money that you 're spending on people and which people are going to help you the best and then money in your office space as to how you 're going to best utilize that office space to create revenue hybrid working so is your current space suitable to regain revenue so with the new normal and the extra space that you need your business might be too small so you needed to change up your staff i.e some remote some virtual some physical or you need to change look at changing up your actual physical space now with lease agreements some of us can 't_''_1531.84 do that immediately but this is where we might have to plan for our next section to make this happen over a period of time and right now getting back to revenue you might just have to get the revenue you can with the people that you have so that burst back into full revenue may not be available to you because you cannot get your people into the right space and can a hybrid working enable you to save on workplace space so once again if your people are in people out have the last three or four months brought a new way of learning for you in a new way for your business it 's a real opportunity here for you to take advantage have you been supporting your teams from home what what remote working tools and challenges have you found what hardware challenges have you discovered and been had to actually put in place or now that you 've got a new normal do you need to assist with your staff with actually their physical hardware it 's one thing to get them to work from home to know they 'll have the right tools and efficiency in transitioning to to that environment and once they are at home and those coming in how does that look and what have you got to do around that excuse me are there any persistent challenges that your employees are facing with the existing platforms what have they currently got with their with their software and their hardware that has been challenging maybe you 've changed up your crm maybe you change up your your ordering tools and have your supply chain changed and are they coping and who can you rely on so this is really really important we go back and have a whole section section four around the supply chain because if business to be much more modern using technology and your supply chain is not keeping up maybe you need to reassess that relationship and get on board with people who can actually move quickly with you once again i cannot stress the opportunity here um through this disruption to gain market share in your area is huge but you have to be on the front for you have to be ready to do it so really really important in these areas get expert advice get real estate expert advice get people expert advice i.t expert business advice and accounting advice you don 't have to do this on your own there 's people out there who are now becoming experts in this particular area so reach out let me know if you need any referrals to any of those areas or just reach out to your current people in those areas and get them to help you so this third section is the enhanced section we 're going to look here at your physical real estate versus your work virtual workspace we 're going to look at revised processes online we get and we 're also going to plan for further disruption so you 're and look at our online business opportunities so what do you need to become a better business through technology and automation really really good section this one this is where we now we 've managed to survive through covert we 've come back down we 've turned our business on we 're starting to get some revenue any which way we can and this is where we take a second to plan the next three to 12 months how we 've actually got to take advantage of the opportunities through the disruption to gain grow and get better make your plan once again something i know we 're bringing back i really want you to make these separate plans so we can bring them all together so your business space of technology what changes can you make to grow into the future physical real estate versus virtual workspace what have you learned from this disruption to enhance your business um what have you through this period of time what have you been able to do to the customer the client and your staff remember your staff your customer as well what have you been able to have to do to make it safe to make sure that you get the health and safety across but also to make it a place that people want to return to the challenge is getting your staff back and getting your people back in to return to that particular space reimagine your workspace how does your space allow for collaboration innovation productivity comfort and safety how are you how is your technology looking in those particular areas so we look at the collaboration areas what have you got plenty of space for that to happen we 've got um productivity what was happening before you know with big work meetings may now need to remain remote might be safer and better for everything to be done online on zoom on teams whatever it might be rather than coming together in big groups and then you can have small workshop groups to to support those larger meetings what technology are you using mentioned a few just then as to what new crms new ordering platforms what has changed and what is going to be better for you to input and invest in financially in the next little while to enhance your business and make sure you 're at the front end of the opportunities that come along so we look at that also as getting better access to technology so this is the time to pull in your it support people have a chat to them get them to just get out there and have a look at what might be able to help you create a smarter better faster business because that 's what 's about today creating out there also let 's look at your marketing and advertising because all of that 's online as well so bring in you know some marketing and advertising people who are online experts once you don 't know anyone reach out got a few people we can introduce you to and they can give you a great plan for a social media campaign which is where the world 's on at the moment to actually bring your business in the eyesight on and what are you doing online to scale to covert 19. so have you revised your processes your it systems your website your e-commerce your risk assessment just mentioned this two minutes ago where you know one of you know with the learnings that you 've had how do you work more efficiency efficiently from your learnings from the lockdown everything 's flipped to it and systems and processes so you need to engage your it guys to make sure that you 're slick to make sure that your systems can handle the extra pressure that 's there and that you don 't end up crashing or your system runs out of space or whatever it might be as we know from recent government news items that there 's a lot of illegal hacking going on you have to be really careful make sure your safety is up so if you haven 't had that looked at your i.t people to double check how safe you are for you your client your customer especially if you 're doing online transactions really important that you have to keep that information you have to can you have the ability to cross-train people have you found superstars out there in the locked down world that have been really beneficial to your business or do you think that there is more opportunity for some of your people and maybe some of them there 's no opportunity at all so do you have to have those hard conversations do you need to reach out to hr people to help you to do that or can you have those conversations um looking at the people how important they are to your business in the future once again can you cross streams cross-train new stars to multitask now we 're doing this under physical office space because this will depend on what you 've got to do a physical workspace because what you 've got to do will depend on how many people you 've got in your business once again i t side and technology do you need to revise your employee processes induction onboarding access to remote hardware and your performance criteria lots and lots of different questions in this particular area to plan people can be spread around a little bit more once again get advice around that because it 's really important if you 're changing people 's contracts or their employment agreements that you 're doing this correctly covert doesn 't change the law so you need to run by the law as to what 's happening and really important third and final question is to look at planning for future disruption and your online business opportunities so what we 've learned through this crisis is that we need to be better online you need to have better marketing online you need to be able to sell your products online you need to access your people online your customer needs to access you online your client needs to access you online and your communication online has to be a1 whatever your business is so wherever you are you need to be able to communicate online to your kids you know to the customer because your customers buying has changed they 're not walking through the front door as much as they were and you have to be able to reach out fastest in this area will win so your learnings you need to put that through with your people and your technology in your physical workspace to make sure that you have the best opportunity to be successful how much is in the budget section part three how much money do you need to invest to get back into the cyber world you need to invest and look at that so as we said we survived through covered lockdown we 've come back now and we 're starting to run as best we can with what we have now we have to plan and pivot to change our business to take advantage of the learnings that we 've got to take the best people in the best space that we have with the budget that we can afford to grow that and you must include online and new tech so how much money can you invest now to bring out in the short term three to 12 months and have those plans in place that when and if and when another lockdown occurs how can you go back and be proactive a second time you 've got to be better than you were the first time and so we 've got to take those learnings and get that investment happening straight away once again look for experts get expert people for technology for training your people for your support make sure you 've got an updated covert safe plan and everybody in your team knows about it and your business knows about it really really important and how you respond to this crisis and how you plan for the next section is how your business will come out at the end of this covered challenge get expert advice i said a few times real estate people i.t business accounting whatever it might be reach out get people that get some great advice so reach out to me if you need to and i can give you some ideas who to go and see fantastic um people out there who are hoping to help or wanting to help you in your business and they 're well worth a conversation depending on what 's happening in your world so in summary what we prosper is to cover off our business what we 've been doing in this particular series we first when covert came we reacted to the lockdown we did what we had to do some of us had to shut some of us were able to morph into a smaller business but actually keep some of our customers going we 've then with lockdowns easing and us coming back to work in some form we 've been able to improve our lot and we 've been able to get our revenue going then we have to look at where are we now what have we done what can we improve upon to prosper and will you be looking at our plans for the next three to six months we 've done six yeah we 've looked into six separate areas of our business part two we looked at specifically the client and the customer and we looked at those three areas of what 's been happening with our client and customer part three we looked at our cash flow and the disruption that 's happened to our cash flow how we happens when that government goes away and all of our debts have been pushed back how are we going to manage our plans and our cash flow to get into that and obviously we talked about the it that 's going to cost for that as well so we look at our cash flow and how that mixes in we 've delved into our suppliers and partners and how important they are to you and how they 're important are to all the business but have they survived how the health of their business you cannot assume anymore you need to delve into their businesses to find out how secure they are have they moved have you pivoted are they taking advantage of the opportunity are they the right people for you to partner with into the future and if not now is the start the time to start to change those relationships to talk about those contracts and to find new people so your business is not affected if their business is affected part five we looked at staff and our technology really really important um be careful get the way people are handled stood down part-time hours full-time hours whatever it may be coming to work working from home all those sorts of things there 's legal contracts around those employment agreements and you just can 't change those at a whim so be really careful about what you 're doing pick out your superstars encourage where they 're going grow your business with the people who want to work with you and the final section we looked at was business space and technology so the technology across the parks the last two how it 's changed with your communication into your staff and into your customer and how the business space how we 're looking at how we 're using our space how much less space can we use in our business are we making sure it 's healthy are we making sure we have the right health measures it measures in place do we have a covert plan for our business in our physical space we looked at our physical space versus our virtual space and planning for that now planning for that into the future current and or future leases if this certain space is not suitable to you or there 's been changes that may be the case each individual business and industry is different so it 's hard to go into specifics for examples your restaurants that could seat a hundred people can now only see 50 or 40 there 's a huge change in the amount of turnover that they can do for that particular business or your office space you know do you keep 10 desks and bring people in and out or do you have to find a business with 20 desks to have everybody there um so we just need to work out what you need for your business and once again where it 's at finish with this slide each week and the reason is really really important how a business handles its return and improvement will define your reputation your performance and your future potential to prosper over the next three six 12 months 24 months your customers your staff and your suppliers and your competitors will be watching what you 're doing they 'll be analyzing you look at coming back it 's really really important that the way you come back the way you set your business up the teams that you bring in to partner with within your business the customers that your service and how they come back are absolutely important to your business over the last six webinar series we 've tried to get you to think about where you are think about what 's happened to you think about where you are right now with your business and plan a little bit further ahead two or three different plans to assist you if things change within your world so i hope you 've enjoyed the webinar series as i said they 're designed to be standalone or in a group together react improve a chance for you to analyze your business as we 're in the improved phase right now and let 's move into the prosper phase over the next 3 6 12 and 24 months there 's my details if you feel like reaching out having a conversation you need some assistance need some referrals into other experts or 'm happy to help i said david coleman been at my pleasure to be with you through this series and i look forward to catching up with you on other topics in the future _"

    "text": "hi my name is maria welcome to keep connected thank you for joining me today i 've got a couple of videos that i would like to share with you today a long body workout and an upper body workout the first week that we 're going to do today is the lower body workout and we 're going to do the lower body workout first because the lower body from the waist down has the larger muscle groups and more muscles that we work first in the order of when we exercise and then after that in the next video we 'll go through the upper body workout so welcome and thank you for joining me today before we get started please make sure that if any exercise or anything that i prescribed through this video is not comfortable for you stop take a rest make sure that you do get clearance from your doctor to exercise and participate in any of the exercise videos that are on keep connected and make sure that you are in an area that is well-lit ventilated you 've got a towel mat always let 's make sure that we sanitize our equipment now the exercises that i 'm going to show you today you can do at home you don 't need a fancy echo block what you need is a step a brick anything a rock a stone that you can use at home as you can see i have a dynavan which i 'm going to clean and will be part of the new process in the gym when you visit us for the classes that are so soon to be released which i 'm sure you 're very excited to be coming back into canterbury bankstown there 's your center to be joining us for some exercise classes i 'm very excited to see you as well so now that i 've cleaned my equipment and before i started this video i came here remember we 've got to throw all our cleaning wipes away and make sure that when you come in next week or whenever you do join us you always have a towel or towels with you that 's important it 's a really important part those coping measures in place so the first thing we 're going to do is the lower body workout the lower body burn and let 's get started so take yourself out in a very wide step we 've got soft knees toes spread out stand strong shoulders sit back our tailbone is jumping tucked under and we 're pulling in through the abdominals and lifting the chest proud looking straight ahead so we maintain a neutral spine we 're going for the burn now with any burn it 's about repetition and overload and as you can see i have no equipment with me i don 't need it because i 've got my legs they are the guns of our body let 's get started now i 'm going to go to 100 squats relax i 'm not going to do 100 right now but i will you need to ensure that as part of that burn that we go for overload and repetition so let 's get started with the squat i 'm going to have my hands coming forward because that keeps our upper body warm that 's not comfortable for you hands to hips right you 're a little bit more challenged you think oh really could use a little bit more work here no sweat and we 're not sweating just yet because we 're just swimming up we can have our hands lightly touching the sides of the body or you can have hands behind to maintain a long neutral spine but today i know because you 've joined me for this video that you do want to maximize every opportunity to work at your optimal best so let 's get gums in front and we 're going a little bit deeper now so i think we 're about to 15 squats let 's fast forward this now and say we 're up to 50. now i think there 's not a lot you would be surprised how easily you do 50 squats in a day through your everyday movements that 's 60 guys i know i 'm getting warmer definitely using big muscle groups so it 's a calorie burn all righty let 's start at 70. now i know in a chuck it down 20 here 20 there 20 there 20 there 20 then you 're at 100. so let 's say we 're at 80 and breathe and breathe and breathe now let 's make this even more effective let 's go deeper only if you can and only if it doesn 't hurt to where our cannon in the body goes below the knees all right so we 're at 19. i 'm getting warm and i 'm definitely clocking up the calories 95 96 97 98 99 100 shake it out we want to keep the heart rate up to keep the burn moving so you 've got your brick rock step outdoor step indoor step backyard step doesn 't matter step in front put your right foot on it take your left foot to the side we 're gonna work out and thigh inner thigh on both legs joining me big breath in what 's our number 100 down left down left down lift now you 've got these arms and they 're doing absolutely nothing not adding any benefit to your workout so they need to 's fast forward wet 50 i can hear you scream 50 okay exercise is about movement movement is about repetition repetition and overload constantly moving the body not allowing the body to get comfortable in anything promotes change increase of exercise or fitness level and deadly calorie burner and definitely a great way to stay in shape all right we 're at 60. cool now we are doing this on one side hey so we have to do the same thing to the other side let 's fast forward this 18 breathe and breathe and breathe and breathe and breathe so what do we need to remember keep the core engaged keep the knees soft as you stand up sit right back into the heels and chin gently tucked in and eyes looking straight ahead 95 96 97 98 99 100 good job big breath all right grab your brick stick at the front at the back inside the house place it on the other side when my daughter was really little and i didn 't have time to get to the gym i used every prop everything i could workout you can do it you don 't need fancy stuff you do i know you 're looking forward to coming to the gym but if you can 't get to the gym right now any prop in your house is a piece of exercise equipment okay right foot on left foot off so toes facing out we 've got soft knees big breath and up and down now what is the benefit of having one leg elevated i 'll tell you why because we overload a little bit more on the leg that is on that is elevated so my right leg or your left leg would be loaded more than my other leg not that they 're not getting a workout it just means that he 's getting that primary source of pressure so fast forward 50 and breathe and breathe and breathe and breathe now let 's make this work our wall fast forward 70 go deeper and deeper and deeper and breathe stretch your arms out raise that arms up i 'm watching you these are not arms okay guys let 's go long arms let hear what my legs are feeling this 95 96 97 98 99 100. shake them out take a breath lengthen out your spine open the lungs big breath in cool now if you did this with me properly i am confident you would have felt your abdominal muscle is being recruited through those two exercises let 's keep going with bone right your trusty brick or step or whatever you 're using in front of you i 'm going to place my right foot on the block holy step it doesn 't matter two weeks ago i went out for a run a jog and in front of my house i had some steps and this is exactly what i was doing in my garage when it was absolutely raining outside and i couldn 't get outdoors this is what i was doing in the back of my step that 's all you need all right take your left leg back good now make sure it 's on the toes i call them ballerina tones okay so this will teach you balance coordination strength and dynamic movement and it is comfortable and it doesn 't hurt now how deep you go makes that move intense the shallower the lunge the less intense the deeper the lunge the more intense hope let 's get started keep back back we 'll run the toes straighten out your spine drive your hips forward lock them in lock it down here we go remember our hands they form part of our workout so they don 't stay still we need to move them we want to double the calorie burning all the time that we 've got okay you need to move your entire body now even though we 're focusing on the lower body your upper body needs to keep moving let 's get the back and the arms going and push back push back good so fast forward you 're up to 50. oh i can hear you scream do not scream at me i know you are screaming i know you 're feeling this but hey once you finish this you are going to go hey i did it i 've accomplished a challenge something that before perhaps i didn 't 70. 70 71. oh see what tomorrow i 'm going to wake up out of it i 'm going go look at those muscles they 're up changing right fast forward 90 91 92 93 94 95 6 7 8 9 10. good job shake it out breathe i have got a special last exercise for you but before we do the last exercise let 's get to the other leg step left foot arm right foot off step right back remember ballerina toes back foot right on the tippy toes heads forward uh lock it in lock it back lock it down you want to remember that marie says lock it in lock it back lock it down good to go now let 's change the arms let 's go and breathe emery we 're in this together you know i think that sounds like a commercial oh my goodness that television angry angry fast forward 50. do not listen to your mind tell your mind to shut up fast forward 70 70. now i 've been thinking about these exercises all day for you so i 'm really options to help you stay fit stay safe and stay healthy fast forward 19 91 92 93 you can hear me heavy breathing 95 6 7 8 9 10. remember the fact that we 've got an additional piece of equipment it is an unstable piece of equipment on a stationary stationary position as an element of intensity and an element of difficulty now uh i need a drink but i don 't have one right with me it 's in my bag but if you need a drink hey pause this video and grab a drink and come straight back for the last exercise we don 't need a prop what we do need abdominals glutes front thigh back thumb nice strong straight back take your feet a little less than the hip width apart or just kind of like your hands are reaching out kind of like an eight frame all right here we go we 're gonna hold the squat in an isometric tension so that means we 're gonna stay down there for 15 seconds come up for two breaths and go back down but look little bit more harder as well now how does this have been impossible that just means you 're going to dig in you 're going to get in and you 're going to commit yourself to do this exercise so we stay down 15 seconds tuck your toe under push the knees out push the toes out make sure your toes are going past your knees aren 't going past your toes if you look down you can see your toes you think oh this is really too easy no sweat here we go shoulders back and down five seconds to go five four three two one shake it out two breaths one two one and sink lock it in lock it back lock it down 15 seconds and remember don 't poke your butt out poking your butt out is going to really not be good for your lower back tuck your butt in eyes ahead you got eyes on me absolutely five four three two one shake it out two breaths one two okay no time to rest today now we 're going even wider why are we abductor muscles our inner thigh yeah hard area to target not impossible area to target big breath here we go lock it down 15 seconds lock it in lock it in lock it back lock it down 15 seconds and five four three two one shake it out two breaths and we start over again narrow squad lock it down lock it down lock it in lock it back lock it down drop our shoulders five four three two one two breaths wanna keep the rest in between minimal to maximize intensity going wide and lock it in ten seconds to go team you got this you got it and five four three two one up and shake two breaths and out all right white step lock it down lock it back lock it in i think i got that the other way around but you know what i mean 15 seconds oh what what you 're saying you don 't want to stop at 15 seconds is that what you 're saying to me i got you a mess 30 seconds 15 seconds more don 't you quit i 10 seconds don 't quit five four three two one shake it out good job well that 's probably ten minutes but in that 10 minutes that 's a good efficient calorie burn now with every exercise make sure you warm up you do the workout cool down and stretch so let 's go through a couple of stretches one hand with your back leg flick the front toes up that 's going to stretch your calf muscle as well as your hamstring pop the toes down get a little bit more stretch in that calf muscle same thing to the other side flip the toes up and one thing that is really important for you when you join us back in classes toes down is to allow time for you to get to the gym to warm up thoroughly cool down and stretch you don 't want to rush that because that is part of your comprehensive workout plan cool now if you need to hold on to walk you do that grab hold of your foot and press the heel towards your butt keep the knees bent cool happy to stand on here without any support grab the foot with both hands great now the heart rate should be coming down your body core temperature should be dropping so it 's stabilized stabilizing your body core temperature as well as your heart rate so it 's really important that we cool down safely okay cool so we 've stretched the calf muscles as well as the hamstring and now the front thought i 'm going to stretch the blue tip and again if you need to hold on then you do that cross one leg in front lift up the leg and then sit back cool if you 're comfortable to do this position and you want a little bit more push the knee down that will get a good stretch around the hip and the glutes glutes are the biggest muscle in your body they are the tanks that drive everything let 's do it the other side now this is the kind of trickier side but i think today i 'm going to master this because you 're watching me so i can 't slip and video is it alrighty push down gently and once reach for the upper body because we want to keep that flexible and supple for a upper body workout that is coming up next thanks for joining me for this video i will see you on the next video for the upper body blast this is maria thank you for joining me keep connected bye for now _"

    "text": "hey guys welcome to another episode with me today we 're gonna make chicken schnitzel famous for any time of the day including a chicken schnitzel sandwich for breakfast so let 's begin over here it 's very few simple ingredients i have two chicken press and two eggs and then our crumb mix over here is some plain flour smoked paprika and basil leaves which i 've just mixed through and it 's going to be our innermost casing and then over here i have a mixture of breadcrumbs and panko you can use either whatever you have at home whatever is the easiest so guys to start off what we 're going to do is place our chicken breast on a clean chopping board make sure it 's always clean and you always wash it after as well what you 're going to do first is cut off the tenderloin bit and then also cut off any bits of fat or any extra bits of chicken breast that 's just flopping around keep that aside to test out your oil once that 's done lay the breasts on up and then you have to cut through the breast horizontally once that 's done you 'll have two perfectly thin breast hearts now lay that flat on your board and cut right through the middle now you would have a nicely butterfly chicken breast which is just two symmetrical halves once that 's done leave them aside and repeat the same process with the remaining of your breasts now comes the most important bit on making our chicken breasts actually look like chicken stencils i placed on my countertop over here two foot long plastic wraps and then on that i 'm going to place the chicken breast and my one tenderloin that i got through my chicken breast and the top of that i 'm gonna place another bit of plastic wrap now once that 's done you can either use a mallet but i 'm gonna use my rolling pin which has a larger surface area to lightly pound it until it 's roughly about 1 8 inch thin throughout the chicken breast and don 't forget your chicken tenderloin is going to be your test so are they actually already look like chicken stencil but you know you got to cook it first so now comes the messiest bit of making a chicken stencil so what i 'm going to do first is i 'm going to dredge the chicken breast in flour make sure it 's well coated throughout and then once that 's done i 'm going to dip the flour pressed in the egg until it 's well coated now look at that i 'm really going at it i did use a really small plate as well so guys make sure you use a bigger plate when you 're trying to coat things now once that 's done i 'm going to place my egg covered chicken breast into the bowl or the plate of breadcrumb mixture now i have breadcrumbs and panko as i told you but you can use either just breadcrumbs or panko whatever you like best now over here i like an extra thick crust or a crumb on my chicken schnitzel so i 'm going to do a double coat but if you would like to do sure you let this rest for about 10 to 15 minutes before you fry them as i said before guys you can just do one coat but over here i 'm just doing another coat because i do want that extra crumb but even one crumb is perfect for a chicken schnitzel as i mentioned before we need three eggs so i had to pause this video run to the shops get a pack of eggs and come back again so here i go i have luckily another egg to play with so guys look how perfect they look so mine are just double coates they 're going to have an extra thick crust but as i said you can just go with one as well now as you 're resting your chicken pour oil into a deep pan about an inch thick and make sure you bring it up to heat slowly or medium heat so now start placing your chicken tender and about another two breasts make sure you do not overcrowd your pan because what 's gonna happen it 's just gonna steam instead of actually fry minutes on each side your chicken tenders would take about two and your larger breasts would take about three minutes so make sure you fry it on one side for about two to three minutes before you flip it to the other side and cook it for another two to three minutes [Music] once it 's been about two three minutes flip it over to the other side and look at that it 's a nice golden crisp color to it man i can 't just wait to dig in but yeah fried for another two three minutes on that side as well [Music] but yeah fried for another 2-3 minutes on that side as well guys if you enjoyed this video don 't forget to comment like and hit that subscribe button wait wait wait for that sound there you go see you next time guys bye _"

    "text": "hi there my name 's david coleman for many years i 've been working with small and medium-sized businesses to help them to grow and thrive through the challenging times in 2020 and the lock down through pandemic we 've decided to put together a series of webinars to try and assist small and medium businesses in uh coming back out of that particular challenge and getting their businesses ready to earn revenue immediately and to plan through the next three six and 12 months and how they 're going to re-activate their businesses and enhance their businesses we 've caused called this series react improve and prosper this is part five of a six part series and we are today going to be looking at uh at our next section of getting your businesses ready looking at what 's been happening how you 're ready and moving forward share my stream with you now we 've got a powerpoint situation here where as we 've said the covet 19 has caused major disruption to many small and medium businesses and business has changed to what uh we 've been so through this series we 've been focusing on different areas of people 's businesses and we 've designed this series to uh to be a stand-alone series for each webinar or to be taken in a group so our introductions are similar for each of our webinars but we get um that as i said they can be used individually or as the whole six we look at uh part two we focus on the customer part three we 'll focus on cash flow and today we 're going to focus on our people in technology so um what 's happened through we decided we discovered in part two is that our customers have changed their patterns they 've changed the way that they 're buying especially our face-to-face customer they 're trapped the travel those businesses that have their hubs around travel hubs the businesses around travel hubs have found that they 're the walkthrough trade is not there so we 've had to have a look at how we 've pivoted our business to create a way for us to take our business to our customer rather look at how to get money and revenue right now and then what how this business and how your business will look in the next 12 months realistically it 's going to be unusual if it 's business as usual the way it always was things have changed the laws and rules of how we do business have changed especially if you 're dealing face-to-face with customers so you you need to have health and safety and a whole lot of other areas so we 're going to have a look at that as well we 're going to look at analyzing where we are take action of what we 've been doing and plan for the next 15 you know three to three to three to 12 months to assist you across those so our next slide is how do you take advantage of the ways business will be done differently in the future and there 's great opportunity um as we said we 're looking at three styles of of the business react where we 've had to uh pivot to the disruption that has hit us one business has changed industries have shut down the travel industry is gone uh the entertainment industry has gone um accommodation is completely different even the way you know large restaurants had to shut down food areas went down shopping centers shut so we all had to change and pivot our businesses really quickly to an online version we may have done some takeaway stuff if you 're in the food industry you may have done um some home deliveries whatever it may have been you 've pivoted something the online style of your business you may have invested in that and got some sort of online going and we 'll have a look at that a little bit more in the future but as we said um we have had to really react really really quickly we then got an opportunity now to take action to restart things are coming back to normal people coming back to work to a degree but business is allowed to react with the customer again so how do we create revenue immediately even if it 's not full revenue but how do we create need everybody that we 've looked at before what have we done before so really interesting time to to have a look at that and then once we 've got some revenue stream running and we rush to do that we then need to take stock and look at what we 're going to do over the next 3 6 and 12 months and we 're going to look at parking several different plans to have those plans ready so that we can improve and prosper in our in our future business and we 'll be able to move easily and reactively rather than proactively proactively as things change i 'm sorry proactively rather reactively as things change and so we 're looking at that as we go as well but as we know times yeah times have changed small small business is the essence of the australian economy and this is why we 're running these webinars to help with the small to medium businesses in the area and giving you some ideas and tools for the necessary that assist your business and improve to improve and prosper so react and improve but also to set up for success in the changed future it 's going to require extraordinary flexibility determination and coordination all those reasons that you became a small or medium business owner we 've been small with grown to medium all those reasons that you had all the determination all the ability and the entrepreneurship that 's going to have to come back again to really kick-start your business to find out who your new customer is where are they what are they doing we 're going to look at three phases we 've got our analyze phase which is where is your business today we 're going to recommence phase which is what items can you action right now to create some revenue opportunity and then our enhanced phase what changes can you make to grow and these are the areas that we really want to concentrate on and actually plan what 's going to happen in the next three to 12 months so that you can take advantage of the disruption that 's in the marketplace because opportunity when there is disruption opportunity abounds the box seat to take advantage of all that new opportunity we 've been looking at six six four six sections of the business as we said uh part two we looked at the client and customer service part one we had a an overview of business in general and where we were in the economy part two we specifically looked at the client and customer and how they had changed we 'd seen that our our customers buyings had changed over the last two or three months as as people were at home and they 're online they 're less accessible to face-to-face business we looked at our cash flow being really careful about where our revenue is going to come from being very careful and selective about our investment who are we investing in what are we investing in how much of our current product do we need to to to restock what do we actually need to let go we looked at our suppliers and partners in section four where not only is your business been affected but your suppliers and partners businesses being effective it 's of business to go back and push into your suppliers or your partners and have a conversation with them about how their business is going if they are supplying you a product and they were supplying many other people though product but three quarters of those people are no longer operating under covert situations how vulnerable is that business to you supplying you or how much more important did you just become to them as a customer and can you manage that relationship better can you get better terms can you get better service can you give that to something so you want to have a look within have a look also where your supply comes from if it comes from new south wales or it comes from your state that 's fantastic if it comes from interstate that could be a challenge and over periods of time or we come internationally that is a big challenge so the current stock we 've got in the country and the current stock we 've got on on the way is okay but what is happening in those countries how is productivity the world but what 's the productivity right back in those countries are they in lockdown so have their supply chain stop so really interesting part four was really interesting to look at today we 're going to have a look at a combination of two of those staff and technology and here we 're going to have a look at how lockdown has affected your staff and how they work and the technology that they use it 's really really interesting what have you had to do to pivot quickly to keep them going teams using microsoft teams zoom you know facebook install whatever how have you communicated back into your staff and how are you managing to promote and communicate with your customer and your in your client um where what do you have to do to get your staff back to work how much will this cost and we looked at that in the budgetary section how much will this cost and uh how how much should you spend on um on getting people back so it 's really interesting some of the big businesses in town to jump back on the commute they have found that it 's really great to work from home we can uh save hours in commuting and dollars in commuting costs so there 's been a reluctance to return so do you fight that or do you grasp that turn that around and take that as an opportunity by investing in better communication tools better crms better software tools that allows you to work clearly and then this is where your microsoft teams and your zoom meetings and all of those can come together to help you if that 's your business so rather than finding that this might be the opportunity as i said in the next section we look at technology and where you work or your place of work and so we 're going to marry staff technology and the place you work over these next two webinars and it 's really interesting to see well is there opportunity for your business to change how you perform in the future to take advantage of the new way to work and the casual way so maybe the 60 or longer the way to go for your particular business maybe it is part-time maybe there 's regular time maybe you completely go to a wework style situation so really interesting that we 're going to have a look at and how can you use your learnings from lockdown to enhance your staff 's ability to perform and produce what 's your ideal team or who is in your ideal team really how does your new team work best are they full-time are they part-time casual contract at home at work a mix between the two and overall this what sort of safety management measures that you put in place um in response to the pandemic that will keep your team members safe so we 're going to drive a bit of depth on those three points over the rest of the world and are today so staffing technology this is the analyze section so when we first went off work or we went into lockdown we had to really analyze where our business was find out now how has your staff affected or how has lockdown affected your staff and use what strengths have you discovered um have certain members excelled and what strengths have you discovered from you know in those particular team members and have you found some team members that may have faulted um so what are your options around those and those particular people that you 've found haven 't stood up to the change as well as others and haven 't_''_777.839 been as beneficial to your business as you may have thought that they were second up we 're going to look at how different is your workforce environment and what has changed and how are you managing performance management through that change and third how have you been communicating with your teams how is their mental health really really really important for all of us to be caring about our team members mental health at the moment and also what changes in technology have you implemented that um that you 've had to rush out and do quickly and we 're going to have a look at those in the third section of our analyze to see whether we 've got the right technology try and um change that up so as i 'd like to mention stay here we need you to get to write this down through each of these webinar series i 've been asking you to build three different plans or three different documents one is around your analyze section um then obviously your your your re-commence section and later on your enhanced section and the reason i want you to keep these together because each of the topics that we 're doing on analyze through our webinar series you can then bundle them together towards the end and we can have a look at all the things that we 're going to analyze all the things that we need to do to recommence to make income now and all the things that we 're going to do to enhance our business over the next three to six months to 12 months so we just keep those in good luck so whatever it might be for you an ipad desktop whatever it might be pen and paper just to build your plan out so question one how has lockdown affected as i mentioned before have you found certain team members that have really excelled for working remotely that have stood up that have helped and assisted your business greatly more greatly than you ever thought they could or maybe that 's their standard role and they 've managed to pivot to online really really well and that they are deserving of your further attention and and working with you and taking them forward into the you know into the future um yes so have you ever discovered any any any uh gems out there any hidden gems amongst your staff um did you find that uh maybe somebody had some strengths you didn 't know that they had and they might be great with technology they might have been the person who ended up running your zoom meetings or your team meetings on the technology side that you really didn 't think that they will know that they had and that was just a skill that they had in their background and uh was really really handy to you so how can you utilize these skills in the long term thought would have been better would have would have been better and could have done better and have they i suppose not have performed at the optimum level that you thought they might and so what are your options around this with this person maybe you 've discovered that maybe in your new revenue stream where in your new customer maybe you don 't need everybody so what are you going to do around getting the right people on board and in this time of change maybe it 's the time do you look at changing up some of those staff members and some of those staff members maybe people who you thought you 'd never change but maybe in the new world maybe they 're the ones who need to um you know need to step aside so you 've got to look at what you can do along those particular lines hard subject but it 's reality we 're looking at your revenue looking at how to get your profit and loss back into a really healthy state and sometimes you 've got to make these really strong do this bit later to get some professionals on board to help you to do that if you um indeed um so what 's going to think about at this point in analyzing how your staff has been affected through lockdown is how do they suit your new business and this is where i 'm going again with your current staff is how do these how do your all your staff members individually suit what the new business looks like and as we did in part two we analyzed what our customer is doing and the changing buying patterns of a lot of people in businesses some businesses are still coming back but how will they come back what are they going to do um you know even if we look at the travel at the moment in trust state within our own state is open for travel and holidays so your international teams are really not doing anything is there some talent there that you need to bring across into looking at your more local support and holiday people and maybe this local support and holiday people haven 't changes that 's been there so you just need to have a look at each of your businesses see who 's capable and who 's who 's going to best work in the new working environment once again looking at the short term and the longer term and we 're concentrating no more today than over the next three to 12 months things are changing so rapidly if you can plan outside that at the moment you 're doing well um do you need to look at alternative struggle workers it 's really really interesting just prior to lockdown the gig economy was taking off people had multiple jobs short-term jobs contract jobs come in do a job for you go and do a job for someone else maybe a competitor but they go and they have the skills that they have and you pay for them for what you need maybe you need more casual stuff rather than full-time staff maybe you need to work on partnerships who are they what are they um working with your suppliers and working with your your client does your relationship become instead are there things that you can share is there a product you no longer need from there but you do need more from here once again have you become more important when we do this in our supply chain session have you become more important to a particular buyer or particular supplier and can you now make a partnership from that rather than the server master situation so once again looking at your staff members who could fit into that patent better who 's able to have those conversations with your suppliers and to support you and it may not just be the person possibly order taking maybe you need someone who 's a bit more outgoing whatever it may be maybe you need people who have got higher tech skills because you can do a lot more online we 're looking at the tech side of this as well with your people so do you need you know to have will you be upgrading your tech will you be getting better faster cleaner and sort of methods and systems and processes all online to marry with the way that are the new workers where do they need to work and when when will you need them to actually start making revenue dollars right now so point two in the analyze section how different is your workforce environment and what has changed and how you 're dealing with performance management so how can you keep how can your business keep a focus on the employee health and mental well-being what is your approach and policies to um to this and do you have everything in place to abide by the government guidelines and employee wellbeing needs it 's a really really important section so many people have actually struggled being on their own there might be a portion out there who really loved it but a whole lot of people may be struggling financially there 's a lot of people struggling they 're becoming you know worried about their self their self worth and you 've got to look at you know your all of your staff members from all avenues there 's some really good focus groups that are out there beyond blue there 's a there is exceptionally banksia project projects like that there 's many many many more out there that you can dive down to but have a look at um what they 're there you know and and really introduce some sort of health program into your business no matter how small you are you need to do that maybe maybe it 's you maybe you need just to have that connection and that support not just you know your own support network but a professional support network as well that can assist you just to make sure that you are on track it 's really really important because it 's been a challenging time no doubt the lockdown covert the whole scariness of it it 's been very very challenging for everybody you are not alone um how are you managing performance management in in in this and what sort of new tools and tech and expert assistance have you been getting so what tools are available to best manage performance in in a diverse and dispersed uh virtual workforce and said you know what sort of crm sales tools are you using how let 's say microsoft teams what are you doing what sort of crm programs are they good enough they might have been okay because you 've had to pivot really quickly but right now to get back into revenue and for the future actually sit back have a look analyze and see if they are good enough for your business and they 're good enough for you to actually um move forward and make money out of them and make sure that they 're strong enough reach out for some professional help with your people to make sure you understand what you 're going on there 's people like the hr department dot com that are you if you 're concerned about how to bring people back whether they 're on the right hours if you need to change up their hours change up their style of working whatever it may be it 's very very complicated um it 's covert is not an excuse to break the law and change the rules so you need some really strong guidance along that so there 's plenty of assistance out there go out there and get some advice there 's advice everywhere that you need to actually go and reach out that you may never have done before to make sure that you can turn and run your business effectively and efficiently to into the future because the new business with the new customer and the new supply chain is different and maybe you need some real advice and people have been up to speed and getting some really great knowledge in this area um have you determined the kinds of work that will remain virtual in your business and which will return to an office environment either on a temporary a full-time basis and sort of um so what processes and practices are anchoring your employees to the physical workspace and can they be changed i mean if you look down to the future can you have this mixed environment of virtual and um and in in-office sort of working you know can it can that virtual and physical space can you make that mixed up can you actually get this really good vibe that your business may have right and saying you must do this have you had to make any structural change changes to to your teams have you had to look at you know what you 're doing in your reporting lines and maybe how to change up there so what you 've got to do right now to earn money you 've had a look you 've had to change some people around you 've found their strengths so have a look at who 's who in your team who 's best to go for it and work with them to make that happen i said reach out for advice if you need that with the right people our third section now third question in this the analyze section is what how are you communicating with your teams what changes in tech have you implemented um are your current staff able to supply and service what is required for your new customer as i said i 've seen in part two we looked at the new customer so do you actually have the right team members in the right roles in the right space are they to have a look at that are you spending enough time ensuring your employees are okay are you remembering to devote enough time to check in on your employees during these uncertain times how are you checking and communicating with them and and and how is their response to you be very very careful around this how have your staff reacted to their change circumstances potentially their reduced income and how do you feel their loyalty is and it 's really really important you build some staff members you 've built this loyalty everybody 's saying she 's okay that 's all right i 'll do it four days a week i 'll do three days a week i 'll do this i 'll do that it 'll be okay but realistically how do they feel about that if things come back all the businesses go out i said disruption creates opportunity have you been a business that 's looked after your team members effectively if not do they come back and change you up for another employer and you lose that fantastic ip because you had to go into you because really they have no choice but when choice comes back to the turnaround say you know what david you didn 't treat me correctly i 'm gone and so you need to be reaching back into your staff members it is really important because there is a whole underway of unhappiness and disgruntled it 's easy to say hey i 'm doing okay yeah she 's good it 's fine but is that the reality i think we need to have a real good reality check on what 's going on a lot of people are unhappy about the fact that they 're earning less money we all are so let 's not be yeah let 's be realistic around the fact that this may mean that we may lose good members of staff so now is the time to address that get some one to ones going while you can actually come back and meet some people make sure that happens so that 's a fantastic opportunity for you to take advantage of that and potentially an opportunity for you to obtain really good staff from some successfully also can all your employees and their man and your managers access new government mental health support programs tools and resources i once again just get expert advice in this area go to people who help are there and they 're trained to help people and you know so you go and get going get people great with mental health if you 're having trouble with your staff members go and find someone who can help you with your staff whatever it might be and we 'll go through a whole list of other things shortly so moving into recommend so right now you can re-operate your business or most of us can in some form away so the next section we 're going to look at is we 're reopening following the lockdown to make sure that we can afford the staff as they return um which government incentives can you still access to assist to keep to keep servicing your customer and your clients so what we want to do here is just to check on part three we looked at cash flow so to check which projected cash flow return or revenue can you actually afford you had 20 staff can you bring them all back on can you bring the map out of uh back into full time work or back into the roles that they once were once again it 's analyzing who has been working well for your business and this might be the time that we change this up a little bit um staffing we 're going to check back once again on our budgets and cash flow who is the best who are the best people for your new normal how will you support the teams as you recommence what are you doing technology wise to keep that support going does anyone come back to what they were are they part-time do you still need to keep some of the remote working going when they come back what is safety measures you 've got in place and what technology do you have in place that you have do you have a covert plan for safety especially if you 're dealing with customer facing employees so in your shops or in uh is the safety measures that you had to go and pivot to really quickly and now recommencing what you definitely have to have in place for those in the way that um your customers and the way that your staff interact you need to have that in place you need to have the in writing you need to have it documented and plans thereof so there are covert plans on the government website you can download and work with and i said there 's people who were in the people industry hr people who can help you with that if you need to if you 're not sure exactly what to do and once again all this is underpinned by the technology that 's changing how will be able to support people in the hybrid virtual world so really really important that you get your technology right once again write down our ideas here in in the re-commence phase and we 'll get into these particular questions so staffing check back on your budget from club and cash flow in part three sorry part three your cash flow boost incentives is the cost of your current staff what changes do you need to make to service the customer today and what about your people salaries ours and the products so get you you know are you eligible for cash flow boost incentives are you on job keeper do you have job keeper payments coming through for your teams what further changes in demand to your services do you anticipate and how will that impact your workplace requirements have you found a niche that 's just gone berserk and your business is about to go crazy down avenue a avenues b and c are close to you so the people who are working in b and c do they pivot across the a and support that or do some of them um come and some others and what is that what does that look like so what changes can you make do you delay the scheduled new hires of people or do you bring them in at this particular time and boost your staff to the opportunity or do you need to say you know what i was going to grow was going to do this i was going to bring on extra tech people what do you need do you need to reevaluate salary increases over the next 12 months if your business has been adversely affected this may be the fact you will not be able to introduce any salary increases over the next 12 months is this an opportunity to engage your teams in this it is on their mind you can bury it and let them make the decision as to whether you 're treating them right or you can bring it out and talk to your team about the future of their income about how much money they 're going to be getting on their normal weekly wage and is there any increase coming yes no or maybe so and you can put that over 3 6 9 and 12 months planned so you know right now it 's no i 've just got back to work we 've got three months worth of debt i 've got my rent and my mortgage on later there 's a tsunami of debt coming i need to get bonus you after six months x_:_1971.039 nine months why 12 months there if we get to xyz that sort of conversation rather than just nothing nothing gets you nothing back and people start to worry on the other side of it do you have to consider redundancies options to including reduced hours for your new staff and through shutdown periods or do you have to once again we just mentioned the financial packages where are you looking and do your staff understand where your business is at really and um you know your business your staff can see the revenue coming through so you want them to understand where some of those costs are so they 're not sitting there thinking you 're pocketing a lot and they 're getting nothing [Music] so once again the following our analysis of the buying patterns in in part two and our cash flow in part three we want to work out what the highest priority is for you in your business to be able to attract and keep your original customer to keep your revenue rolling plus pivot to the opportunity that up a new customer so really really important we have the right people on board with the right salaries as we go how will you support i 'm sorry this one people so people who is the best for your new normal business so have you planned for potential shortage in talent supply now this sounds really crazy but um if you come back and you need people are they about is job keeper keeping them away they 're going to stick in their current role because they know they 're getting paid under this period of time so if you actually need these people what are you going to do to attract them do you have to go to contractors the gig economy casual whatever it might be to pull these people across what is your employee value proposition in the new normal how does the business and how does the business address concerns of on-the-job security and uncertainty over the future so really really important here that as i mentioned before what are you doing to allay the concerns of your teams about their uncertainty in the future 're going to be working and the income that they 're going to receive so they can manage their own home budgets if you don 't have the conversation people assume the worst and you could actually get lose really good talent um just by not communicating with them how does the business yeah uh how do you imagine or manage the volatility in work shifts and in work activities to redeploy skills so if you said who is best in your team who is the best people in your team for the right job where they 've been before may not be the best place for them now as i said while they 've been in lockdown or remote you may have found absolutely really good sources that all these team members might have new talent that you can actually grab and um and utilize it 's a really really good uh to touch base with that and then once again on communication what tools and tech are you using do you have the right tools in tech have you just when things hit in a rush did you go online and offline now is the time what do you need right now to recommence and turn a dollar and get that going it might just be the same as it is and then in the next section we 're going to look at planning do we have the right tools so here we 're going to look at how we recommence what items can you action right now in our third section so how will you support your teams as you recommence and what technology needs to be implemented so once again we 're touching on the mental health and well-being of getting your stuff back to back to our work how do you connect engage with support with your virtual team and are you equipping leaders and managers with resources they need to support the teams and install trust in a virtual and hybrid workforce so really important that you actually sit down and manage where your people are do you have enough two-way communication in place uh with your remote employees to um answer their concerns to manage their their their challenges um how do you happening in many many parts of the country and how are you managing to change around your your your needs or how you need that particular person to operate and so that you can be flexible enough for that what tools and platforms continue to be effective to support physical and virtual work this hybrid work and is there another way so it 's a really good time to get professional advice get professional advice around your people get professional advice around the mental health get professional advice around your i.t your systems and your processes get someone have a look at it and maybe they can come up with a brand new brand new there 's been such a boost in technology through the lockdown and the covered period that things have been developed so quickly zoom platform on for instance when they started in december had 10 million customers by march they had 210 million customers they 've had to change what they do how do we change what we do so now is a really good time to look at that to recommence to get dollars going the three things we 're going to look at here is how to enhance our business so what does it look like we 've pivoted out of the emergency of changing straight away and we 've had to have a look and analyze our business we 've got our doors open we 're trying to create revenue any old way possible and manage our staff the way it goes that 's fantastic run turn that revenue there we are now take a chance and have a look just take a moment and say well what are what 's going to be most beneficial to me and my business in the next three six nine and 12 months because business has changed i 'm running today but do i need to be over there is there an opportunity does has the disruption created more having for my competitor than it has for me so what changes can you make to enhance your business we 'll have a look at that which team members will best scale post covert 19 and what do you need to become a better business through technology into those once again writing down what we 've got building up a plan so this is where we 're going to build our plan under the three different sections where we can enhance what we 're doing to um and prosper into the future so what changes can you make to enhance your current business and who and how many people are your ideal workforce based on your customer analysis part two so in part two we asked how will your revenue model change based on the change relationship with your customer and your client what changes could you make to your current business to take advantage of that changes so now we add to that what is the ideal workf workforce size to enable flexibility sustainability in the current environment so that you can move forward um what capabilities are most valued as you evolve work priorities and outcomes and then what training and upskilling is required and where do you need to invest in your people in this particular area and it may be different to what it was if you 're a very sales-focused business the your ladies and your team around getting things going and how they actually communicate with the customer and what technology they 're using to do so may have changed over that period of time the face to face in the doorstep meeting is not as easy to get today so what sort of skills do you need to do on that have you learned uh what have you learned also around effective collaboration and working together did you find that people teamed up and they 're much more effective working as a team or a pair out there selling rather than out there on their own whatever it might be whatever industry that you are in however it may be done is your technology up to scratch and what do you need to improve upon to be competitive so what changes can you make now to enhance your current business is your tech right what do you need to do do you need to get advice around that and if so how much and you start to budget how much you need to change remember we 've got revenue coming to do but what are we going to look at into the future to be better and to be ready with the lock down again it 's happening there 's going to be waves coming we spoke about this in our opening um our opening webinar part 1 how the different waves will make us change i want you to lock in some plans three or four different plans so you can pull out plan two we 're locked down again this is what happens plan three my competitors shut how do i take advantage of that plan four things are going really really well but i 've got to change up some people what do i look like there my tech needs to change and this is where we 're asking those questions and i need you to go out there and get some answers build those plans in to enhance your business to make sure that your business platform is secure so that 's really really important really really important and if you 've got that staff how are you going to support your staff so they support tools especially when they 're remotely working which will allow them to remain engaged and work effectively and you 've got to reach in you 've got to reach into them there 's no point just talking to them maybe once a day in a work environment you 're communicating all the time if you 're sitting around and opposite people you 're throwing queries and questions if you decide that you know an email in the morning and a telephone call in the afternoon or a zoom meeting once a week is enough i 'm telling you i don 't think it is so you need to have a higher level of communication you need to as the manager push that not wait for that to come back really really really important to keep the team engaged over the period of time which team members will be best to scale postcode of 19 and i touched on this earlier have you found any new stars in your business can can you work more efficiently from your lockdown so um and from your lockdown learnings have you managed to find 't actually know how good they were in all the areas that you need and have you found people who have not so good so do you have to move people on and you have to analyze how each person how important each person is or is not to your business and there can be some really difficult decisions to have to make here who 's going to work best in your business and if your business looks like it needs to be skinnier your customer has changed the revenue is less your products are actually sold for less whatever it might be then you 're going to have less revenue through to keep your profit to a reasonable level you might have to have less cost and so people may need to multitask moment to manage more and do a lot more for you so do you have the right people in place for this to occur are there opportunities to cross train your people and your employees so that they have can perform a variety of roles to future proof your business so really really important and if code that happens what processes what employee processes do you need and can you actually put online such as induction onboarding access to remote hardware performance management all of those things can you know what systems and processes can you put in place so they can be done remotely so once again really really important to have a look at that in your business right a now question in this section what do you need to do to become a better business through technology training people and support so what have you learned through this crisis and how can you implement the best parts of those learnings in the next three to 12 months to make sure that your business is on an upswing and that you 're taking advantage of the disruption taking advantage of the opportunity have you updated your covert safe plan do people actually know what it is where it is how they can work remotely how they can work face-to-face with customer whether they 're in your office environment dealing with client whatever it may be um so you 've got to work around your the different changes that we 've got coming and get expert advice cannot push you enough with your people and your technology when we did the uh when we did cash flow we want to check back with our accountants and our expertise here there with your people get to the hr departments we 've done with your technology go to it support and find out what 's going on check out what is there be ahead of your competitor and this is the important part the improved phase will determine the future of your business your customers your staff your suppliers and your competitors will be watching what you 're doing how you return and improve will define your reputation as a business your performance and potential to prosper into the future so we 're really over this series of webinars been looking at how we are reacting improving and prospering in your business how did you react to covert wasn 't successful what have you done now as you 've reopened your business to enhance and improve your business to improve your business and what are you going in the new ways and in the new um the new way of business the new way of of customer the new way of employee new way of actually creating revenue and trade so you 're really going to have a look at all those so this has been part five which is looking at our people and technology around our people one more part six we 'll be looking at technology and the places that we work from and our customer environments so thank you once again for joining me today and i hope you 're getting something out of these webinars feel free to reach out and contact me as i said my name is david coleman feel free to reach out and contact me if you need any further conversation or comment around this i look forward to seeing you at the next webinar thank you _"

    "text": "hi there my name is David Cole for many years I 've been working with small and medium-sized businesses helping to grow and thrive we decided to put together a six-part series called react improve prosper and in this series we 've been looking at many aspects of small and medium-sized business and assisting them to ask questions around how the best way for them to come out of the rock down period through the recent pandemic and also what to do to kick-start their businesses he immediately starts up revenue immediately and look at the future three six twelve months and decide how their businesses will look in that period of time so we 're going to go through a little bit of the backstory of where we are today today is part four this six part series and today we 're going to focus on supply chain and our partners and supply chain so we 'll be looking at those and I 'll give you a summary of what we 've been doing through that particular period of time so welcome to Veda hope you 've been enjoying with you with the presentation that we currently have so as I said our four-part series or six-part series and this is part four react improve and prosper so covet 19 as you 're aware has caused many great disturbance and to disruption to many small large and medium-sized businesses and business has changed for a lot of us even from 3 months ago when we started how we 're doing business how we 've conducted business what we 've had to do to create some turnover and some revenue even through the lockdown period the restaurants doing takeaway and delivery we 've got company companies that work in in in shop service and now doing online service we 've got their delivery services going through the roof and people are doing a lot of work shopping so your business might be I think that same way the last three or four months we 're going to have to have a look at what we 've got to do to capture the customer and their change patterns of behavior how we have to make those changes to our business to and so we take advantage of the opportunities that disruption does occur now this has been one of the greatest disruptions across business and industry and what happens in the disruption that this is opportunity for those who really want to go and take it so we 're going to have a look at that we 're going to do that by analyzing where we are taking action to get going and planning what the short to medium term future might look like and how you may be our to move your particular business to take advantage so we call the first part react we 've had to pivot to the destruction with no notice during lockdown what did your business do having it you know managed to survive did you manage the keeps of revenue going are you people working from home and you a shot protector closed down or businesses actually have to completely closed down because your businesses is all wrong industry was completely shut because of this the improves we need to take action and going to talk about how we 're going to take action to do to start now in the current circumstances and we 're doing that by analyzing different sections of our business to see what 's happened and it starts with the customer and the customers buying patterns have changed and we will see that through how they 're traveling or not traveling the stay-at-home worker is doing less commuting the less commuting meant all those businesses that that worker may pass on their way to their community and no longer have that opportunity to sell product for that particular person so where are you if your business that 's nearly commuter huh or your business that 's in the city then numbers of people that and opportunities for you have reduced dramatically so we 're going to have a look at what you can do this restart your business now your revenue now and become attractive based on those into each of the sections that we 're looking at and then we want to quickly plan and have a look at how we 're going to win in the future how we 're going to win new opportunities that are change their buying patterns what do you have to do to become relevant and to find new customers in a different way so we 're going to look at those I said across all the different areas that we 're looking at our business small business is the essence to the Australian economy and we know times have challenged as business owners we 've needed to react entering and we need to improve to sign up for prosperity now is the time that you 've really got a good look at your business if you 've been an established business for many many years good luck if your business is just turn straight back down but you 're reaching out into these webinars I 'm sure that there is a change in your business and we need to analyze that change have a clear mind on to why that has happened and reality check as to what we 've got to do to restart that particular business what you can do now can affect the ability for you you 'll across them in the future now is the time to it and we 're going to have to push back into that whole reasons they were really very established business or in new business the whole reason you went into business small medium business owners it 's because they 've got extraordinary determination and we 're gonna need your flexibility we 're going to need your persistence on the journey and have locked down and back into reality and back into normal or whatever the new normal maybe and so from your journey to recovery we need you to have those great for the truth that got you to where you are now can be difficult to detect those steps back before you move forward but that 's what we 're looking to do this series is to assist you through those particular challenges the way we 're going to look at this the Murray commence phase we 're going to look at three actions will then analyze what we 're doing so where is your business now so when you react improve cross by to find out where your business is now looking at what we 've got to 're going to look at what actions in the recommence phase then look at what actions you can take right now to read kick off your business in all the different areas in six different areas of the businesses that we 're looking at and then we 're going to look at how you can enhance your business what changes can you make to your business to grow your business to take advantage of the disruption that 's out there to recreate yourself and be attractive to potentially a brand new set of customer because your current customer may no longer be available to you or you may no longer be in their firing line so what do we have to do so we 're going to have a look at for each the second that we look the redeeming space analyze where we are telling ana recomment and how to enhance what we are as we said there were six sections of the business that we 've been looking at part one of the six part series we actually do an overview of what we 're going to do our entire business needs to focus on changing behaviour of the client or the customer and what has happened to them and from there we can reset and we focus all the other avenues that we look at so it 's essentially going apart to have a look apart and really analyze your business through where your customer changes I have a look at that one that particular webinar part three was on cashflow really important of course where 's your money how much have you got where we going to spend it how 's it gonna go caution was the word get expert advice was the other thing so you thrall through that webinar is about being cautious with your funds and also getting expert advice in helping you place your funds in the right areas to read kickstart your business today we 're going to talk about suppliers and partners and how they 're affecting affected in the young with the with the pandemic and in the lockdown period and so how that 's going to affect them and how they their businesses might be affected which might with we 're next we 're going to wrap up our next webinar will be start in technology combination and our last one will be our technology and is this combination and we know that all those things have changed as well potentially have changed for what we need to do now and more importantly that panic stage you know where we are now we 've pivoted so we 've been a little bit of time on that pivot stage but we have the itch that recommends how do we make Domon right now how do we actually get going into the future and what that looks like for your particular business and for many many of us it 's going to change what I 've said today we 're getting at suppliers and partners so let 's analyze what 's happened to your suppliers through the lockdown period how has a lockdown period affecting your suppliers in your partners are their businesses robust enough to support your restart many suppliers have suffered as you have many suppliers have had to send people home everybody has been through the same their to their ability mystifying you your products or the services that you need to supply to your customer and what about their surprise and what has happened with their surprise once again out there where is that line go and the way to do that is to communicate with your supplier so we 're going to have a look at how the lockdowns effective supplies are their business is robust enough to support rules and in your restart and what do you need to change up to allow your business to grow so what happens next what do you need to do to make that yeah that next step how come those suppliers and partners assist you how do you know they 're going to be the right people the right people do you need to look elsewhere so we 're we 're going to have a look at um all of these centers to ask questions so you can go and have a look and ask questions around this you might need to obtain new service level agreements and even perception edging up suppliers depending on your legally our first question is how secure is your supply chain and where is your business today so still we don 't look here we want to find out initially what do you know about your key suppliers and partners what do you know about their business so we 're going to find out about that do you understand their business model and the viability of their business in the current circumstances but they can be a small supplier they can be a massive supplier but they may have had some changes in their own viability at the moment so I said that very relevant there 's huge industries yo that have actually shot ending in ending a real real trouble with us at the moment to look at an industry which is very public and how the whole travel industry is is really quite shut down the tourism industry and all the suppliers the jus tourism industry of course so quite close you 've got your speaking industry in your events industry it 's just gone your holiday and hotels you know how are they given it was some of people who are in quarantine and they 've managed to survive along those lines on government funds but well what happens to the people supplying family here in that industry and if you 're part of that supply what 's happened to you in client how 's that change to what you need from the people in your supply chain so if you are supplying one of those industries with product and that is stopped how do you need to pivot to keep going in your business and do the people whose I mean your supply chain to the south of you how are their businesses change and what is affected happens you may look there they may not be able to come back open they 've been change dramatically yeah we have been kept alive at the moment with some really good government subsidies part three around the finance and money went into that subsidies available however what happens with all these changes so how do you understand them business models in their viability and then looking into the future what pipelines in their analysis do you need a and do you mix there any renegotiation whether it be with a supplier a contract how that contract looks the terms and conditions or costs of that contract and where lady your call so there 's unit nobody 's asking questions Deven for you to go and have a look and how your business may look in the future as I do quite regularly ten notes this is where you sit down we 're going to go into the analyze section where your businesses today and all through these these webinars and seminars I want you to take notes down so that penalized section or recommend section and a planning a section and so that three different sections and notes so you can drop in each of the webinar sections underneath here 's our analyze at the end we can bring that all together so create that document and keep that government whichever works for you how you create a doctor so in the analyze phase how security of plug that supply train overall where is your business today how has lockdown affected your suppliers and your partners so what how much do you know about their business and what has happened where are they located nationally which state away in and at the moment in Australia that 's very relevant as to their ability to supply you are they met international if their supplier is international or their supply chain has international links how has that affected their ability to supply you with the product once again we look at the customers demand as to what kind of will be needed and therefore what supply what supply I do you need in which products and services do you need sealing your customers needed to make change so all of these things where they located what the top of this is serious how they looking how they 're sort of coming Yona can be planning definitive and lock them how does that impact their supply to you and you definitely how have your suppliers been impacted and how important are they with you so we 're looking at all these particular areas and the way to do this is down to communicate and then do something that you may not back bring back in talk of the people who are in use hue of supplying your supply chain rebuild those relationships don 't just be the customer getting there so as people calling you it 's time to go back and analyze what those relationships are like are they there other the right people do you have the right set of pipeline coming is their pipeline and is their supply chain relevant the only way you can find out is to communicate with them pick up the phone talk to them it 's the best way yes you 're doing that but really to hear how they are how their business is you know when it 's like when you 're on the phone if your business is in stress is coming it may not be fair but it 's the survival and your business that we were interested in today and it 's so important if you can 't get the right cut up regularly enough the right price to service the customers who needs your businesses in jeopardy so you need to be able to pivot with the and we can analyze that when we come to the end of the webinar series as to what we have to do next I hope that extends their businesses robust enough to support your restart so I analyzed their businesses who and where have your operations being impacted so we won 't have a look at what you where you 've been in that and then what is currently happening with your supply of that product to where you 've been impacted so you may have a supplier you can supply you with a whole on a stuff that your customer no more balloons however your customer may want a specific type of item all your competitors customers more importantly may want a specific type of item by type of item so you want to find a supplier you can subdivide that and as we said in part two of the webinar series one of your customers needs charge and we said right at the beginning of this series it 's all about that you need to be communicating with your customer to find out where they are today and business doesn 't mean that customer now is the same customer nor going to demand or need the same items so how is this impacting on your ability to create revenue was realistic you know getting the right product you know can sell and you need to look at you know the right products and the right ability of the right goods the right services that are coming through can they certify that if you 're a service industry looking at so people servicing you and they 've got everybody stood down then how can they assist you if they 're your call center or they 're your you know your emergency IT team or whatever it might be and they 're scattered and and don 't have coordination and no plans to come back and put in the right technology to make that efficient these are the type of questions you 've got to ask in your supply chain they you 've gotta change it up your business dollar is being spent every minute whereas coming from as we 've said before it 's really really important to understand 's all around your area that might be great if the production is international and forgetting our product from China or India or anywhere in our usual anyway now what is that product what is that travel and communication importing like at the moment for your product the southern might be okay shoots and flames coming in with the imports and exports but what about your product how often are they coming in how difficult is the car industry we 're here this week selling lots of cars people are transacting their product and supply train has been disrupted there 's not as many cars coming on boats from the suppliers overseas so there 's becoming a shortage so that might be artificially killing prices in a group level right now but what does that mean if you have to fill more cars in your boats to your craft get affected the one you need for your business it 's time for you to take a little bit of control what 's going on really really important your suppliers how well are their existing facilities in supply line set up have them you may have to look at your physical distancing you 've got to look at your sanitation and what can happen what 's happening to your product who 's touching them how well are they going to be sanitized and what does that look like as you go down with your no supply chain this is really important because the more and more we rely on overseas or international or interstate supplies to come the more challenge or more opportunity we have of bringing the pandemic across and actually more people become infected with the virus so we need to make sure that everybody is playing their part to make sure that you your staff and your customer remain safe secure and able to continue to create revenue do what this entire series is about I hope that makes sense to third and a large section for the question we have is what do you need to change out to allow your business growth so as we 've said are your current suppliers and partners able to have enough supply what is required for your new customer and referring to that 's where we analyzed our customers behaviour and some ideas in there as to how to do that one 's going to have your supply chain people change their businesses practice especially with the new laws and regulations and our neighbors secure in this challenge economy it is going to ask the question what am i doing are they on job Cleveland did they qualify for job Cupra the to be what have they done and people stood down as their technology people work and in the office or out of a factory or a nadare shop how are they working how are they able to supply and come together and do the things that they need to do for you you may also if you 've got some time at this point explore alternative suppliers of partners if those particular supply lines seem a bit shaky if I see people start supplier lines don 't look so good and here 's a chance for you to take advantage of the current disruption to business to see if you can get better alternative supply chain and a become very difficult so what wise doesn 't necessarily have to be the same it might be the same with your end product you may into the future not beyond a charge as much of your end product if the economy all takes a hit you may need to move your own pricing every color that section three as to what you 've got to do to keep your business going do you have to skinny your margins to make sure you make a dollar so you 've got to be aware and if that 's the case there 's everybody going to get down the line with your supply chain then these are the questions that you 're going to be working with next second we move into the recommence so we 've been pivoted we 've looked at what we 're doing with analyze where we are look at all these things our supply chain now what do we do right now what are we going to do to recommence which products services does norm you customer need now can you restarting meeting with the current supply chain are now in play with you what new technologies are now and play with your supply chain what timelines are those deliveries on and how regular are those deliveries the delivery section at the moment seems to be pretty good and lyrical but what about down further needs to come from other places so that 's what you need to do what works now so you come back to part two of the customer so this is what the customer needs this is the product that I have I need more of this product who can get it to me now by the way I don 't need this product it 's sitting on my shelf what can I do about that it 's actually a debate Kinley you know what does that look like getting refunds whatever that might be the customers change what they wanted to do this is happening everywhere so you need to look at how you can turn your revenue dollar right now and in the finance side or the cash flow side in part three we looked at what you got to do just 's about what about the profit as much immediately get started get going what have you been doing and to it now and if we were doing takeaway and delivery maybe inducers sit there but then again anything remember the costs that sit there on what 's happening on with the restrictions that we 've got so how quickly do you come back and what suppliers can bring you the right amount at the right time so all of that 's gonna happen to break up right now once again get it onto your plan through your recommend section get it in there underneath the other subjects so that we can plan it and bring it all together towards the end so recommence what items can you action now in your supply chain which products service does your new customer need so the next section we 're going to look at how we when we reopen following lock down which products and services do we need following analysis or the new the new buying patterns of the customer so what 's the highest priority for you to be able to profit or good turnover of revenue or quick sales the more the better behind that you 've got the marketing which was spoken about previously to actually push out those products out to your current customer your past customer and to future customers out there that potentially your competitor hasn 't been able to attract dealer because they haven 't come out of we 're gonna order the right product but haven 't will do this into my trade this is where you 've got an opportunity to take advantage of disruption this is where business to really flourish you 've got to be brave but you 've also got to do your investigation start running now cautious with your money but be open and start to work with the customer that you 've got through your database through the customer walks through the door and then your future customer which is through your marketing advertising through your facebook through social local area whatever it might be then you need to do to bring your customer in whichever type of business you are small marketing or advertising or large market surprise we supply those products it 's really interesting as we 're speaking today there 's new supermarket shelves are being stripped of product again and you look at that and we know that the supply for these products is out there however the supply chain just doesn 't physically able to keep up with the amount of product that can be taken off the shelves when everybody takes the same product and takes too much the same product so what does that look like in your business are you the person who can sell all the toilet paper but you 're still safe with all these items of products that still don 't sell you 're on a smaller organization you want to be on a supply chain the product that 's moving more quickly so do you need another supplier in that supply chain and really you don 't need any more supply of the product that everybody wants and it might just be now but as we know that we 've been to go back to normal all the products sell way back supermarket however right now pastures and the products along there for the chair but I want to be I would have them every single day in my pipeline and that 's a tough call that that 's what you 're looking at when you 're looking at how fast can your suppliers read to try these products because you 're looking at churn you want to make revenue you want to be able to get back on and start to fill some of the holes than the last 12 weeks not down have taken out of your cash flow so can you restart immediately with your current supply chain do your customer do your suppliers have the right systems and and are they the right suppliers you in the wire so you just want to do with the ones indeed the right product what do you need to change up in your goods and services middly create revenue so we 've mentioned this comes back to part two around together customer where are their needs today supply chain I need that supply now can you do it I don 't need that product I and you and that 's the way you might be going up and growing your particular business what are your cash terms and we look at that in part three what are your cash terms looking like what is your own cash supply looking right but can you really go check does your customer is your customer point paying new one terms if your cash business across the counter that 's fine but if you are you a customer that has terms of your client and one your turns back to your supply chain Tim you had some extra time in there so that you can save the product and delay payment but receive your payment forward just look after yourself that 's what this is about at the moment get you through the next section and that recommencing right now just negotiate you the best deal possible if you can 't reach out for advice so that 's the best thing to do reach out for help someone can help you do that negotiation meanwhile you may have some legal documentation they tie you into things let 's see regulation says everybody 's there to help so let 's see who will open your supply train you give you some time to get going again once again can you supply a replace out-of-date stock they 've known depends what it is what are your contacts say can he look back it hasn 't been done it hasn 't been used because you haven 't been open so how do you dispose at this age of the tree is it just in the bin or is there something in your contract that allows for this particular circumstance and allows you to go back or is it insurance a problem and are the insurance company on board so once again check check check ask for support that 's correct if it is if you 're not sure third section a third question in the recommend space Hana make a dollar now is what items to you action immediately order actually immediately and the question is what has changed what new technology what timelines worth delivery so do you have enough understanding of your supplier train and what 's moving through that your supply chain management that you 're not aware of there you need to find out of it so there might be some changes coming in your supply chain that can conversely or proactively affect your business and so whenever it 's coming you need to be aware of it if it 's bonus fantastic if it 's firstly you need to be able to manage that change it up or whatever it might be do your clients give them the shut down lock down period has been a huge growth in technology and how things have done remote working new systems new processes new crms whatever it might be might be out there all this tech it 's this time we need to technology technological changes and so we 're going to have a look at what 's happening are you are up to date with where it all suits or have you been left behind so you need to really understand what you need to do now to actually change up obviously in Italy you cyber security get advice in this because it 's such a minefield you also cyber safe and then you at the end of that have the ability to reflect that cyber safer 's so is really really important because you can be exposed by the changes to some of your trading partners have made and they might not even realize they 're exposing you to it so you really need to have a look at how that cross-pollination of information happens and what changes are there to be really careful because we 've seen and heard some very very disturbing attacks through technology in the business especially taking money taking spy training taking data whatever it might be that is valuable to to the person looking to grab that then we 're looking at pursue each piece of information that you need that you understand all you learn about trying to get going now will it assist or detract from your immediately revenue opportunities worried about the future at the moment just getting open and going so take what you need to make that dollar happen so then you can just got an income coming in the third section we 're willing to just run for now I 'd rather have some money coming in even if you 're not even carrying covering your losses in your profit and loss and least you 're chipping away in it and your loss is not so big we need to be prepared for when the government subsidies stop they moment it 's the end of September if they continue on us then what happens then so you need to be prepared to get going and we 're ready and uniquely the business satisfies doesn 't matter you may have to take your competitions business but it needs to be you so in our third section it 's the enhanced section what are we going to do to grow how does it have what changes can you make in your business to enhance your current business who 's going to be best to partner with in a post kind of at nineteen world considering this is just going to continue and continue for quite a while so who is there who 's made the changes who 's made it easy who do you want to be the right time at the right prices these are the type of thing that we need to look at for the next three six twelve months that 's a short-term turnaround while we mean this crazy period that we are what do you need to do to become a better business yourself technology automation how much investment do you need can you cut some money out of your current cash flow to put into that investment to make it better invest to grow this is about opportunity in revenue it 's about opportunity for growth into that opportunity for survival it 's not necessarily a period of time about opportunity for profit it 's now later so let 's add into now and the great advantages of all the people who need some work there 's a lot of people who 've got time to help you and they will be pleased to be working rather than expecting you to be paying top dollar you use that sounds tough that 's your business that we 're talking about here you need to be able to survive so you use this does what I remind you take your notes put it under the prosper and hand section so that all the sections together so what changes can you make to enhance your current business it 's a set in part two we 've mentioned it many times we analyzed the customer and we 've discovered the customers have changed in most businesses whether it be their travel pack patents to work or not whether it be how they find what they 're buying what their needs are where they 're going where they 're not going where they 're going to go in the future whatever it might be their needs have changed so we need to reach out and find out how that affects our business then we found that we 've got to work out where are the best suppliers if they 're not like current suppliers you need to engage new suppliers you need to look at what they can do either at you supplier list or start moving your supplier list across depending on your contrast getting rights if you 're not sure but that 's what under scratch it 's your cybersecurity I cannot mention cybersecurity enough there are some specialists either companies that they engage them what do you need to be to improve to be competitive if you 're in the service industry everything 's gone online this webinar series this is online we weren 't doing this 12 weeks ago we 'll face to face in small groups in in with with small companies in libraries and in small areas in your council in your local area now we 're doing this across a larger audience there 's more people who are looking to have an understanding of where they are most amazing things about this series that I 'm seeing people who are established business owners who have done it all before who know that I 've got established business now going on my goodness my business is not there I 'm coming back at 20% revenue I 'm coming back at 30% revenue what am I going to do to obtain that other 60 70 percent and been usable this secure business but the customer has changed in needs at once and you in their pipelines on your team with the right product also does your system give you enough warning cracks or shortages so let 's go back to yeah then the clearing of supermarket shelves it 's pretty hard but from our point of view as a consumer will get empty shells from the supermarket the point of view they 're looking into the supply lines to see what that supply looks like and how long it 'll take them to refill those shelves and where they are so had a chance once this is second term there should be no problems with a third chart they should be surprised built in warehouses we know what 's going to happen third time around you will come and then we will be able to prayer so in your business if you 're stealing you 're a frontline business in your selling crap tons and tons of hand sanitizer for 10 weeks and then it stops and you 're caught with the hand sanitizer we try to seem and super in in in some businesses and then all of a sudden is work out what those patterns are you want to be on it pick up the phone SI and need the hand sanitizer for this period of time and you 'll consumer in your supply chain need and react to that as we were that 's new stuff don 't don 't just react to the consumer be proactive and ready to go when the consumer changes their pattern again you 're ready the next day with your supplier because you had a plan you 're first off the cab you 've got the communication going so does your current system of give you enough warning surfaces are shortages so then you want to go back to your supply chain and say what are you going to do with this what are you going to do how your supplier they how we go to work so really really important that your trading partners I 'm also aware and able to be proactive in their reaction Milligan 's you know what does it look like in a post transition period post September plumber says subsidies go away how are you feeling 've got to start paying in mortgages you 've got to start paying your rent again what happens with foreign balance in a constricted economy and you know mainly to fight really really hard to the next question in section question to who will be your best partner with postcode with covered a lot of this how do you manage your supply chain who were the best people in that particular supply chain to to partner and collaborate with are they all necessary they may no longer be necessary all people or their products all that natural supply chain that you had may no longer be necessary with the new consumer demands so work out what you need to do there collaboration opportunities instead of being a servant master relationship with supply chain maybe you can work together to fill those supermarket shelves whatever it may be in your business to work with your suppliers in a collaborative way and can you negotiate pricing I mean how important are you to their business you all revenues are gonna get skinnier your turnover might be less if dollar value of a surviving to get out there and you 're gonna ask your surprise to do everybody needs to take a hit the economy is going to be prices may not be going up there might be only reverse they haven 't seen that a lot in our country be prepared be proactive go in the front foot keep your little net profit as strong as you possibly can finally how can you invest in your businesses by China really really interesting how do you become a better business look at your technology and again look at that over the next two series or two webinars that we 've got have an internal look at that to staff technology and also without how our place of work of technology so we get that 's our next two weather us and help you invest in the business supply chain management to better mitigate future risk so whether it be automation new technology collaboration new safety met methods new standards of product new standards of supply whatever it might be you need to understand what 's going to happen so you at the end-user to do to turn dollars and what does that look better in X 3 6 9 months 4 months people and property what changes and facilities and layout to your actual works like do you need to make to make little people safe where are your people today some in the office some in your shops I mean your factories some working remotely is that available is that possible can you still keep them stone safe can you still manage with other code that 19 regulations that I 've come across Australia can you do your suppliers have the same ability which suppliers can do it which ones can do you know yes you need to find out who you going to partner with into the future so that better technology better automation better collaboration few people safe in an area environment that you can all work with you 've got to take control of that pipeline otherwise you 're just reacting to everybody else and then your business is vulnerable to everybody else 's movements so ladies and gentlemen react improve prosper this is the end of part 4 in there to provide training but where we go into the improved funds so we

bringing up my next song because it has been it has been a while since I 've played some of these anyway I 'm gonna play another song from the same EP actually this song I co-wrote actually with Dylan Nash and I bought this idea of this chorus to the studio session and this is kind of like my my Taylor Swift breakup song with my ex and a lot of things happened in in this relationship that wasn 't too fun but I decided that I would write it all in a song instead of telling the whole world alright so it 's kind of discreetly hidden in the song and this was actually a lot of fun to write and then I recorded this whole EP action with my friend Josh Satterfield who is based in Queensland with his studio and his music and yeah we had a lot of fun with this song in the studio recording obviously all these songs have a full band on this year recording so it sounds a little bit I wrote them all so it 's kind of cool to yet to play them like this but yeah in this song there is a few little little background digs we have it at the situation which you can hear on this studio version if you do enjoy yeah it 's called nothing like you [Music] I wonder what led you to a lot of laughs tell me who did you wrong major hey anyone that 's loved yeah but wonder why drove you to drop me insane now I 've known what to say now I know everything well there 's two ways I could go about it I can tell

yeah it 's been a while since I played that one actually so yeah hope you guys enjoyed that one hope you 're all been alright with lockdown and everything it 's good to see that some restrictions are easing which is nice and we can sort of get back to normal life but obviously it 's been really hard um yeah not not having music and I mean not not having music but not being able to go out and play and venues and stuff so um if I do have a gig anyway in the air Canterbury Bankstown again thank you for the council for putting this on and I 've seen a lot of the other videos that they 've been posting in this group which is a really cool idea to keep everyone connected during this time which one am I gonna play now actually how much time we got okay alright so I 'm gonna play a song which is from the same AP but it 's actually a duet on the EP with Joshua I recorded the AP width and originally this song was was not written as a duet I wrote it yeah just obviously as a as a solo sort of acoustic thing just for all from the girl 's point of view but when we 're in the studio yeah I just thought might be a cool idea to to mix it up a little bit and have have jatta Singh on it as well so we sort of changed up the second verse and made it from a guy 's point of view but obviously I 'm just gonna sing the original which I wrote for this version but if you do want to hear the full one I think it 's actually the most streamed one of the most streamed songs on Spotify from my EP which is quite cool so yeah if you want to check it out check play this one for you now this one is a song I wrote sort of about that feeling after a hard time or ablation ship or a hard friendship or anything like that where it starts to feel okay again and you realize like new beginnings happen and whatever that was in the past wasn 't the end of the world and you do survive it but not time sometimes you think that you don 't know you won 't_''_1322.28 this is kind of that moment where you literally start over and and you start to feel okay again so yeah it 's called starting over [Music] cutter I don 't wet I saw him walking up I 'm looking down [Music] where I came from in our where I wanna go hard in my head it 's beatin fast now it 's like wind [Music] when he 's in number the second chance paths cuz there 's nothing like a new beginning like the first half you leave the pass in the past and animals like a heart that 's broken to be made bringing you closer there 's turns up to my door hardened his hands I 'm looking up now like a new day that 's arising from that dawn the stars are there in exhaust and it 's mine striking when he lands first is new beginning first I 'm feelin in [Music] it 's broken [Music] it 's nothing like starting on [Music] there 's nothing like a new beginning nothing like first time feeling you leave the past in the past of animals broken to be made brand-new clothes starting on [Music] we go alright I 've got a couple of songs left for this little livestream so I released a single on to my YouTube channel and on to country radio I think it 's two years ago now and yeah it was a really cool song that I got an idea for actually in the middle of a gig when I was in the break with my gig and I was literally sitting on like a sofa at this bar where I was playing and I got this idea for this song and the chorus idea came into my head and I sort of like went into a corner with my phone and yes turned on the voice memos and sort of like sung this chorus idea like without my guitar anything just sung it straight into the phone people were probably looking at me being like like what is she doing talking into her phone but that became the chorus of this song and I recorded this song with with a guy called Sean Carey I don 't know why I just pause them and he 's a really cool guy he actually was to be in the band thirsty murk if anyone knows of that band and he 's got an amazing studio in in Sydney City and yeah I went there and recorded this and he like totally brought this on to life it was a little acoustic song like here now but we put in yeah a lot of work into it and I was so happy with this recording and I definitely want to go and do some more recording with him because he was just an awesome guy and just yeah super supportive and really yeah wanted it to be so then I actually filmed a video with a really awesome amazing young and up-and-coming filmmaker who saw me at a gig actually and we got chatting and he was like I want to do a video clip for you so when you have a single ready let me know so once I recorded this song I hit him up on Instagram and was like hey we should do that video clip now and we did it and we spent like a full day on this beautiful property in western Sydney and basically got to run around on this on this farm and and then dress up and do a cute little band scene which you can see all this on youtube if you just search this song called heartbreak it 'll come up there but I actually got played on country radio which is really cool and yeah this is one of yeah one of my favorite songs and I was just super super happy with how everything turned out for this single it 's gonna play it free now just have a little drink hum to get standard so yeah anyway this song is called heartbreak and I hope you enjoy this one [Music] Oh [Music] turn it again I got lost then I fell then his arms and when I sunk oh man I should have started running that is gone instead of moving on I need a heart break no more hey I 'm a clown nose and jump in the fast lane okay [Music] I need I need I need aha [Music] the girls I should have just listened oh why they say [Music] hey boys are killing going I need a hot [Music] Hey Oh [Music] myself [Music] so hey hey you see

this on and keeping us all connected during this time I really appreciate you guys listening as well it means a lot especially to be able to play all originals too which is amazing it 's like yeah so

instagram Facebook or anything like that I post all my gigs all my music in my videos and all that on all the platforms basically so I will leave some sort of will leave some links or something anyway so you can check it out but I 'm going to finish off this little set with um a song which actually never recorded yeah it 's never been recorded I played it at a couple of gigs awhile ago but it 's just yeah a little acoustic song which I actually just love playing and it was one of those ones writing it and it 's kind of about basically about music and I think it 's kind of applicable to this whole situation that we 're going through with corona and just having something that 's keeping you making you feel okay and keep keeping you connected and whether that 's friends family some sort of art or your work or music for me obviously definitely is music and so this song yeah it 's pretty much about how important music is to me and sort of no matter where I go or what I do I 'm always just gonna come back to music and this one 's called run you [Music] have a fighting back a feeling drifting slowly there 's a man in blue skies ax used to reach for open windows feel closed in [Music] in alpha [Music] get away you 're making everything feel hard but right back to where [Music] I can never leave a sick stream never give in cuz a feeling when I 'm playing but I could call my love saving

    "text": "hi there my name 's David Coleman hi for many years I 've been working with small to medium businesses to help them to grow and thrive so we 've recently put together a series of webinars to help people to look at their businesses in a positive light coming out of the pandemic in the lockdown time and how to get their businesses kick-started how to have an analysis of where we 've been what we 're going to do to get businesses back up and running and how we 're going to plan to make them bigger stronger and better than before so we 've created a series of webinars as I said called react improve in the prosper and this is part 3 today and we 're going to hit in a cat 3 which is around cash flow so we 're looking at that as we go so I 'll share my screen with you with the presentation so as I said Kovach 19 has caused major disruptions to many small medium and large businesses across the country and really across the world and business has change from how we do business only 3 months ago example food venues in in business focused areas may not be this episode walk by customers you may have had to change up how you do your business rather than sit down you might completely take away you might have created a home delivery service within that particular business and you had to change out what you what you 've done and what you have to do if you 're looking at a service industry your customers may be spread around being in singular office so you had to work out different ways how to service those particular customers and satisfy their needs in looking towards technology I 'm sure in a big way to help you to do that so what we 're going to do to manage the changes that have occurred there 's three parts a week there was three paths in recovery where react react is what 's happened now we quickly had a lockdown the quick thing you know this pandemic the virus came very quickly so we needed to react very very quickly some trying to get our head around that staff may be working remotely would life have had to downsize very quickly some of us important have to shut completely and and their businesses still may not be open or when

plan as to what we 're going to do into the future and how that will enhance your business and grow him into the future so that 's what we 're going to look at across the presentation for this point as I said the three things we 've better react when we 've pivoted to the disruption improve take action to restart and plan and implement to win had to scramble so quickly in the reactor mode probably haven 't had a lot of time and chance to plan so we 're going to have a look at that as we go I 'm gonna look at areas opportunity where we can build and grow and the one thing about disruption is that opportunities are there for those businesses willing to take those chances how well have you have you recovered are recovering how will live your customers recovered and how well have the competition recovered so we 'll have a look and all those things do just our business is the essential is the essence of the Australian economy we small to medium business is a huge portion

for a lot of you with established businesses if this is a restart these are things that you 've got a steady business and then a portion of business may have been affected may not be there anymore you might have to look at doing things differently even if it deep back into those feelings in that I really the persistence that really started you in your in your business journey and reset Enrica the reason you know we you start small business and you start million business is that you have determination you are able to do this you have the ability and the determination to actually 's a you 're going to have to reach back into those strengths and work out over the next few years how that 's going to why are we going to create a great business ever than its previous in the improve phrase where we are we 're looking at six parts of our visas we 're looking at the client customer section we 're going to analyze read comments and enhance each of these topics so it 's been some time we will work out what 's changed and how we can take advantage of each of these changes in these areas so each of our webinars will concentrate on as I said one of those particular topics the client customer cash flow suppliers and partners the star technology and you know where you are your business space what happens with that and how does that look today really importantly we 're going to concentrate on the cash flow side so we 're going to look at how we where is our money how 's it looking at the moment he 'll again invest wisely into the future who 's a very important part it 's one of the parts a young entrepreneurs tend to miss enthusiastic company businesses and and great ideas and want to get things going and love what they do with the customer level in with the client but it 's the financial side that we really have to look at to make sure that we 're able to continue so it 's gonna tone down your entrepreneurship in the end and we put on our financial hats okay so know your numbers plainly prosperity where is your business today so initially we will be looking at your current financial situation analyze what you 've done since lockdown how have you managed if you have managed to keep revenue flowing and where your business stands financially we 're going to get you to the look through what financial packages are available for you to survive in to keep start new businesses as we move through lockdown and I 'm sure you 've taken advantage of some of those we 're going to reiterate some of those that are out there and finally we 're going support the growth of your business as we and hence your business as we grow in the future and plan over the next three six twelve months just to kick-start it 's really turbulent time ahead of us yo RIA we 're not through what we need to be yet so we need to plan and be ready financially as well as the other areas as well so what I want you to do is just take a moment and we stop at this point and say this is where you do need to take down some notes this is where you need to create a document written pen and paper document on the screen whenever it suits you in the way you work to create a document to write down the analysis of your business so that you can plan for your future success so again death challenge you with some some thoughts and write these down so when you 're talking to your advisers and you 're talking to the people who support you in your business you 've got these notes across each of the topics that later into an Excel spreadsheet you get the numbers out of 0 or quickbooks on my árbol one of the numerous and airy packages out there so have a look good thing for that help you can work moving work work in the best way to document this particular subject so do you understand your financial situation can you effort lis work out where you stand today do you have a zero on my of a QuickBooks whatever it may be if not can you read and do do you understand your cash flow report and can you read and do you understand your thoughts so it 's really important you understand the story the financial story of your business being able to read through your cash flow report and read through your P&L in profit and loss to find out where your business is sitting for those of you who qualify for job keeper you know you would have had somebody look at this already I 'm sure because you have to prove 30% down on business so you understand that 's where you see so how do you the job keeper have a look at it before John came after John cleaver to find out what your the situation have a look at the young other areas that you may have been able to take advantage of that 's relief all whether you 've taken advantage of some Avenue super take it on loan from the small loans and were available whatever it might be have a look at where you are special for you your P&L you 're going to have a look at to what you may have deferred in payments to see really where you are bring those back into the law that you choose going to look like so very very important is sit down and understand what that is there might be working with your accountant on the same streets and you 're really clear what was your revenue stream what were your outgoing to what was your profit gross and net and now what is it today what does it look like in the last quarter really important we have a look at this and understand what levels of cash or equity what cash is in your business accounts how much line of credit or overdraft facilities do you have how much are you currently using what is available left because we 'll need that to have a look at where we 're going to how to keep that our business where our investment needs to go and also when we 're looking at growing and enhancing our business how much we 're going to have to reuse that to invest to keep start our business and to make sure that our business becomes stronger in grows and thrives in the future I have a look at if there 's any business equity in your business so yeah that 's your business however you hasn 't been making a profit have you built wealth within that business and can you scroll down on some of that wealth to drive back into your business to keep it going and get it going today where your way to your business have said it 's really easy just go out there pay your bills spend whatever it might be over this period of time really really good look at where we are today so you know exactly where you are when we 're sitting there look at your creditors and evidence how much do you owe how much is owed to you at this point in time where the sector where is it balanced there was a cash flow look like in two if you do not understand I suppose I understand these numbers then my recommendation is that you gain personal personal assistance from an advisor an accountant who can help you here a consultant who can help you plan with these numbers over these slides today I 'm not asking used to do this on your own go to your help go to your core people we 've been looking after you and get them to help the accountants they were looking busy it 's really important with the numbers that they understand and you understand where you are and then maybe you have advisors consultants who can look into your business and assist with you to take stock understand what you 've got to do to rethink your business which we 're going to do to plan into the future so really important that you 've got these particular points available to you and they know what 's going on finally what is your financial plan for the next three to 12 months as you come out of lockdown what is your expected revenue ballast with your customer nurses from part to part three of our webinar in part two we looked at the customer how the customer is changed how their buying patterns have changed if your business relies on water by table people normal can buy they 're not going to work if you 're in the city or you 'll end up on a commuting section people are not committing at the moment slowly coming back but even in the city at the moment Ruggero is probably only 20 or 25 percent the workers that come back is entire buildings they still not open so once again at section 2 and part 2 which we looked at the changes in your customer any analysis of that so one is you you 're now expected revenue immediate expected revenue from 've gone through your customer analysis why do you current expenses fixed and variable they may have been they may be down at the moment the the the fixed revenues salaries you may have people down on the towers or maybe stood down or whatever it may be so you 're fixed it may have dropped a little bit your variable may have dropped a lot because you 're not actually going out you 're not spending you may be your sales people out to actually visit customers so they travel their costs they 're on road may not be in your business at the moment so you 've got an opportunity to to secure some of the cash in your business that they develop and reinvest it wisely in the future don 't just keeps that what you did before there 's what you did before may not balance into what the market allows you to do at the moment once your work where your revenue streams are now and your customer care your cast customer throws and their habits they may have changed your client habits may change at them how they worked and then we 'll affect your cash through your fixed and variable expenses what is your even contracted revenue look like do you have set effective revenue and what 's happened to their business through the covert locked in a variable revenue and what happens there as well then the feast revenue might be fantastic those businesses are not open is that thing swimming lets you secure for the next three to six months you know there may be debtors now and may not ever pay you so we need to reach out find out what 's happening in their businesses find out what 's happening in their cash flows and this is a thing we need to go out to our suppliers go out to our partners go out to the people who we work with on a daily basis who are important to our business to make sure they 're secure and find out just how secure they are listen in your conversations as to really think they are financially and what is a livelihood and then coming out you may need to talk about in the future when we talk about a survive hackers but you may need to have a really good look at those and you 'll variable within you so that 's the revenue that comes and flows and you 're unsure where it is what does that look like from a pasture analysis what women look at that what does that look like for your revenue and you really need to drive down to assume then it will be back to where you were before needs a little no you need to actually have a really good solid look start to pick up a phone communicate talk to your own suppliers talk to other people out there even competitors to find out whether they 're seeing the same thing that you are seeing I said every business has their fixed fixed expenses rent you know regular salaries electricity basic stock they are the burial expenses maybe travel events extra stock extra staff extra work that comes out of your minimum running costs you want a lot of future cash flow analysis so including the government stimulus future cash governments in deceases is this a negative and how long can your business sustain a monthly running love so when the stimulus goes away are you actually running profitable profitably so you need to do your analysis with the current stimulus in to see where you are now but you need to do your analysis the future stimulus out or the customers out to actually see what your future revenue looks like on today 's videos because that may even plan to see what you need to do to be profitable you cannot make profit on today 's figures then how long can you sustain a monthly loss I 'm tweaking that around in your business let 's say to reach out into thee so your supply chain or your partner 's reach out into that particular area healthy check their businesses and their viability to make sure you are connected with the right people to secure your business moving forward okay plan your prosperity so in recommends this is where we start looking at when you 're coming back through up they 're really getting stuck into how we suggest that now you have a financial plan what 's the reality in reopening your business and regrowing business right now I recommend you keep your expenses limited until you understand your revenue prospects open wish caution stay within your current financial living stoking those leads consider your customer and client and their movements how fast back to pre lockdown Domini da ones do you think you can come really really important that we don 't just go out there open up every door in your business region it 's everybody to find that baby of revenue strings and not where they were and you 're currently only huge huge cost each month that you are not traveling close obtain financial advice accountants financial advisors experts to help we trim costs in your business keep fixed and variable costs in check now and into the future it 's a great chance to really have a good look at your business to really understand hey this could be the transfer meter to to move those things around to renegotiate that supply train to make sure that those people who have taken have a chat to their competitors just to see how valuable you are to them and make sure it 's a really good chance for you to really have this in looking to the future no it can 't_''_1249.629 be difficult there are government 's are talking about recessions and and the whole world is a teacher from the entropy of that area recessions and further so we really want to make sure that you are skinny as possible in your outgoings to make sure that your revenue streams start to come up all of your costs intricate mechanism their profits negotiate turning on contracts with suppliers or landlords take advice around there from the people that Experian then feel you could sell quickly sell quick turnover and spendable assets we had a look at consider stopping and deferring payments for a short term but how do they affect you and when and run through the government revenue packages so that 's what we 've got coming up I said a lot in the next couple of minutes get proper advice make sure that that happens in your business as how you 're going to recommence your business whatever you got to do we 've actually understood where you 're at now what have you going to do financially to create your business about the next few slides we 're going to run that those particular numbers and how to recommence so as i spare the beginning open with caution stay within your financial means and obtain advice so now we 've got a financial plan yeah I said what is the reality in reopening or growing your business team expenses limited until you understand your revenue prospects really important slowly little bit regrowing consider caution over boldness now I know we 're entrepreneurial and now we 've got a small business or medium business some of you may have been used to great incomes take it easy hoping with caution just make sure your customer is there the more chance we have come and knock down the wall people who go back but then again your customer may not have their spending dollar available because a day may their particular jobs their small businesses their income stream may have be not having a worker there may be a job seeker they may be you 're not working there might have been stood down they may be on shorter hours so the expected revenue from everybody may be reduced supported this is a really good way to start to reopen set obtain financial advice through accountants financial advisors experts to him to help you trim your costs and negotiate terms of contracts chase your debtors whilst keeping your own on terms and within your cash flow borders it 's really important that you 've got to keep the cash flow moving and keep it happen so do that very very quickly and if you need to create opportunities sell any quick turnover expendable assets quickly so we 'll easily move parts we 've got quite a bit too easy to move get it on sale get it out the door create a revenue even you have to sell it out you know reopening style create activity around your business so you know marketing campaign around there to get rid of the stock that 's there because we need to move it doesn 't have a timeline your stock or your service doesn 't have a timeline now 's the opportunity to re-engage with the people who are also looking at you in a supply chain option and whether you 're the best efficient or your customers looking at you as we look to whether you 're the best person to buy product from or to take that service from so now is the time to create opportunity for your supply chain for your customer and your client to re-engage with you by creating opportunity and creating sore cash really really good idea get things going create opportunity now maybe some sales whether another so what are what items can you action now initiate plan part two to increase revenue as possibly so you keep off the Risa cure the customer plan from that to three as I said about webinar series so Pat to when we run through how to Risa cure your customer keep that plan off immediately let your customer know that your back then you 're available what you can do what 's available you might be you can actually supply to them to make sure you engage in what you can do as I said a minute ago maybe offer some kickstart renewal sales items that can we enhance a relationship and get them used to reordering the supplies from you post they 're checking you air you should be checking out your your own supply chain and Pamela 's I haven 't really deferred payments that can find Paymentech that can be deferred reduced or stopped completely for a period of time and I know we look at some of this but now it 's still appropriate now get back with some revenue you might say you know just a couple of months it allows me at a lower revenue to keep things running so have a look at what those payments are engage your financial institutions see where they can help you have a look been to your accountant as to how that impacts on your P&L and on your cash flow and whether it 's wise you have a cast later to the other babies better these payments in a third so they 'm hearing out there some people are not renewing leases and they 're go into a virtual world fantastic so you know we look Section six we 'll be looking at how your personal space is being impacted your business faces leaning back but if that 's not an option for you if you need your space to cost a lot of you need your space for business then you need to have a look at how that 's been affected and maybe you can negotiate some term turns around how that works for you so that looks better on your cash flow but once again be cautious about the lane opportunity or delaying payments if they 're going to have to be paid at some stage you get to build your cash flow to do that get proper advice just take it from me make sure that the experts in your field your consultants your financial adviser so it happens you trust I 'm looking at your P&L with you and giving you the correct advice so let 's have a look at some of the government packages that allowance which I 'm sure you 're all aware of but that whereas allow small business or medium business or business to actually continue supply and then pay their staff even though they may not have the income the Quatermain qualification is that you need to be down on 30% of business month on month from last year once again your financial people will help you with that if you 're not on it because you haven 't qualified have a really look and see how you 're going if things are changing as you come back out you get allows you to bring those terrific staff members back you 've got to a PAYG withholding cash boost so that 's allowed you to sit of some money to inject in your business through these periods right so use these funds really wisely in people that 's grabbing is money off their going elsewhere you need this degree building your business as the 80-odd best relief which has been a fantastic especially for small businesses that the best is one of their larger out going to one of the more been fantastic to a level to reject that into their businesses which is awesome what else do we have here we 've had the instant asset write off which is coming up towards the end of the financial year so take advantage of that if you 're looking at buying and investing in your business take advance the internet behind it can happen immediately there 's been small business loans available and low or zero interest rates very little scrutiny around there so once again have a look at them be cautious it alone you 've got to pay it back so they 're going to make sure you invest in them to recoup revenue movie your cash flow look at your customer look at your supplier trade look at your current areas of where you work and how that looks and make sure that this is all going to get in an investment and look at your return on investment of having a look at that yeah what else are we done there 's the small Lean Enterprise commercial leasing code of contact if you have a look at retail or commercial or industrial premises so go through and have a look at that this government grants available for small business on the ATO website Australian Tax Office website there 's a link there that takes you to all the support that 's available for all the business out there so if you haven 't been on that site and it 's been good time driving through there trying to understand what 's going on I recommend you do find out what 's good in there then go back to you financial advisors in twelve we deliver getting some knowledge just don 't trust what everyone 's telling you there 's so many different options available for businesses to assist flow miss your chance to keep back in take advantage of these to be open now okay final section we 're looking at here is how we 're going to enhance our business into the future and plan that makes three six twelve months we got how we 're going to manage our cash flow growth we 're going to lock in future financial support the banks and and are we going to do then we 're going to forecast fixed and variable costs and forecasts that had a section on that and then forecast our long term beneficial changes then I have a look at all these to do finish up our webinar this morning and look at what we can do to enhance and grow so then we would have ended where our cash flow is now what we 've got to do to use that cash flow kick it open our businesses to create some revenue right now you know in a very cautious way and now we 're going to look at how we can enhance and grow our business how that should be done who are going to do that with and what is the end result what is that financial plan number and as I say this is where you need to write this down so you can read back into your financial suppliers and your financial health to make sure they 're on board with you to make sure that you are getting the best advice and allowing your financial people to a bit of little bit in the dark sometimes with our numbers and so we really need to understand specially I 'm planning what we think it might be looking at past P&L x '_''_1915.34 may not be the way to go so we have to understand what the future may look like the revenue change may have changed so maintain the cash flow growth for long term so prepare for the worst-case scenario on your customer analysis part twos are impact who we asked how will your revenue model change based upon your relationship with your customer or your client so now we 've got a look at how swirls and our phone area questions we need to look at our pricing I 'm gonna supply a cost imaginative third payments so we need to plan to grow but not to overspend we need to look at our pricing on what we 're offering our customer this may need to change you might be okay to come back right now and charge what you were charging before however if your customer is not owning the same money they were current product or service or be afforded as often so if you are a food organization you might be 10 or 12 a plate and your customer used to be a GU coming by food you three times a week or now it might be works and so are you two-thirds down on that particular plane turnover at that price if that was a reduced cost and smaller margin to keep you going for now with that customer out and come two times three times until they come back and their business puts it back on the full-time income just have to talk to your customer to find out what 's going on which is what we spoke about in our to look at your supplier costs if you have to think about what you 've got to charge your customer then your suppliers may need to be looking at the same thing you need to be asking them about this look at your cash flow they won 't they need you as much as you need them they need you to buy their product or they need you to they introduce their product into your business to selling the final customer so maybe we all need to renegotiate what that looks like in the next three to 12 months look I say this doesn 't come back in the future but there 's no point just reopening expectation is we are whether we are and then budget for any deferred payments so anybody even a lot of people run out defer their mortgages defer their loan deferment they rinse had a great conversation with their commercial landlord to actually cut they rinse down or knock it down but these rents are not white these deferment payments are not bad so you 've been running a very closed profit loss situation through good times what 's going to happen when these come back at the same time the government stimulus packages will be taken away so you 've got to actually plan for this and make sure that you can afford to come back and get your cash flow raising up so you can actually be aware of what 's better come in the next three six and 12 months in the government stimulus package happens for six months or 12 that 's how you 're looking to find balance in a constricted economy it 's time to negotiate and make sure that you are getting a fair go from everybody that you can actually manage that cash flow for so you know also okay next we 'll get taken some notes we 're locking in future financial support and your banks and your finance now to turn to re-establish relationships if you haven 't been to see your financial banks go if you would have been able to go and see them much talk to them you can go build that relationship catch free meaning whatever it might be to re-establish that relationship to let them know that you 're back give them an idea that your you 're going to be successful and now you know now they need you need their support and you 'll be able to manage their support if I natural support and when support is now is on everyone 's mind everyone 's been told to get out there and support one another know they need to support us but they want to be sure this according the right people backing the right horse so you try to let them know that 's you take your P&L take your plans your three six nines and go and meet with those financial institutions to reassure them and you 're the best person to be partnering with so you need to be well planned or a growing business that 's who they want to be with so you need to show them how you 're well planned anything have you re growing your business take advantage of their expertise and meet regularly large financial organization kindness that will it will take advantage of this they want you to be successful so really don 't hide from them embrace them they can share your success however they can also support the deficiencies they can help you get through a period of time where you may need some extra cash you may need some extra revenue you may need to actually be able to push and and till you actually are able to increase your revenue stream whatever it might be and they can help you through that also rework your debts reassess your loans in your overdraft facilities and then need to be extended for a period of time so how 's that going to work what my abilities will that create business what lanes will that be on your business and other businesses just time to really analyze where you are what you need to race there is just like that is so important to all businesses and here we go forecasting fixed and variable costs and for glass in the long term beneficial traders for absolute nightmare but we 've got to do them fixed and variable cost as I mentioned at the top I fixed and variable cost may have changed if you 've got people on reduced wages in the fixed cost has come down it may have been out of all the resume a new negotiation and you 're loose and in that once again if you are talking to your suppliers reducing some of those fees costs that comes through that you need for your product and your variable costs and out and about and doing stuff variable costs have dropped and those people have realized they actually haven 't_''_2298.95 been spending much they 've had more net to actually spend it 's been quite amusing for those that do have money they seem to have a reasonable amount of it so what is happening with you variable cost but being realistic to kick start your business again you need to actually start to spend some of those variable costs so you need to look at that with creating winning opportunities with your partners with your suppliers with your customer and each of the companies you can deal with them have been effected through lock down as well so where are they what aren 't I doing how are you how can you don 't_''_2334.229 them come back how to label the full course the long term beneficial changes do you have the best products products that you want the products you need to sell now might really change up your business focus um are you in the right service how you 're offering more about service do you have however might people have they been paid the right amount of money do you have the right people to help new securities Navan time to change a business fantastic opportunity when there 's Fox there is disruption take advantage of it do you have the right materials or like material suppliers all these questions that you can look at are you in the right location do you actually as a segment some officers do actual knee dislocation equal have you learned to work and certify a different way so you get in place to create a best return on each of these investments that you 've got in practice those interview people notation they 're all investments so let 's look at the greatest return that you can actually get out of those so let 's sit down and plan work with your advisors get advice reach and talk to someone who can help you reject me if you need to get some advice on where to get that advice and we 'll certainly give you a hand to make sure that no business comes back and stay successful as regardless of your business and regardless of the size of your business the industry your business is in and then how that business in looks what are the business industry relevant let 's go again what other industry relevant options that will be maintained or expanded upon so you can have a look at your business and how the whole industry they 're learning looks and how it 's going to expand in the future and what can you take and learn from the timing lock down then you can take them in how to move forward and that might be in reducing some of the things that you do or pivoting or changing the focus of your business or your product so really interesting time to change and now might be the absolute perfect time to pivot and and create a different style of business or service for your customer so there we have it react improve and prosper part 3 we 've looked at how where we are currently with our finance what we 're going to do and how we 're going to spend cautiously to kick-start and doing

    "text": "namaste and welcome to giles magic workshop today I 've made for you a version of a famous trick called the nest of boxes it involves a coin this coin is marked by your volunteer this is my volunteer mr. Rupert he will inspect the coin make sure it 's a normal 20 cent coin and market with his initial with any mark he will remember in the future the coin is folded tightly into a piece of paper and it 's Rupert is asked to feel to make sure the coin is there then he peeps it inside his pocket he doesn 't have a pocket so it 's under this foot inside my bag I have a small present this present is kept way over here on the other side of the room now nothing has happened dessert now the magic begins the coin will float across into the present and watch inside the bag is another bag inside this bag yet another container seal with two rubber bands inside another box sealed with two more bands and finally inside is the coin with the initial as I items you can find around your house you 're going to need to find a bag ideally a drawstring bag some rubber bands text a pen matchbox is good and most importantly to make a coin slide now this coin slide is just a piece of cardboard you could make it with plastic you fold it in such a way as it will fit in the mouth of the matchbox and the coin will slide down it without getting stuck straight down so now to prepare the matchbox we 'll have the rubber band across like this this allows when the coin slide is removed the Box should close like so just sits inside the next box again go together inside a drawstring bag you can be creative with this depending on what you have around your house you can keep stacking it inside inside inside another one so long as you can get your coin into the mouth of the coin slide and remember you need to pull it out so if this is on the top of the bag you pull it out this way not going to chance that we will see the coin slide coming out good with the paper the trick here is in how you fold the paper up down down down this allows the coin to just slide out slide out like that so essentially the thumb is holding it when you release the thumb it comes out which works nicely when you let your friend or friends even all touch the coin they can feel it 's there as soon as you tip it up it will fall down into your fingers place it in the pocket and bring your hand into the bag to take out the present you can say you have a very special present eventually it shouldn 't take long for the coin to now be in the bag the plane slide has been removed and you 're all set to do the magic to the audience 's mind nothing has happened this is how you should feel you have just prepared the coin is here the Box present is over here and now you 're ready to do the magic clap imagine the coin is coming oh reach into his pocket he can take then you can hand him the bag empty they can open everything its strongest like that let them do the work they will be more convinced as they open the box especially the final one when they look inside you should see a look of surprise as they see the coin with their initial well this trick takes a little bit more work than my other workshops but it 's well worth the effort I hope you practice it practice it hard I 'd like to thank you for watching this workshop I 'd like to thank the candidly thanks town for having me as part of this they connected program that 's all from me today _"

    "text": "hi guys i 'm going to show you how to make this cute little bear in watercolors or colored pencils as you please here we 're going to start with a nice empty page and first thing and you should do this with all your drawings we 're going to draw a border now there 's a couple of reasons why we draw a border it 's easier for framing if you do a really nice picture and you want to show it off it 's easier to put a nice frame about it it also defines the page so if you had multiple pages like if you 're doing a book or if you 're doing a bunch of pictures all the same you can make them all the same size also it 's just neat and tidy so you know where the edges of your page are which is your lines drawn if you paint over them it doesn 't matter because your picture ends there so that 's that bit first okay now for the drawing oh first i should tell you about our tools ruler we going to use a pencil and eraser to draw our bear then we 're i 'm going to use some watercolors and uh we 'll go step by step coloring in our bear we 're going to use a couple of techniques we 're going to use dry on dry wet on dry sorry wet on dry and then we 're also going to try a wet on wet technique uh for this bear to make you extra cute so first thing our bear needs is a body so you can see our bear here he 's an oval shape big hoop goes to just past halfway up the page so we want to leave lots of room for our party hat so let 's do that first so we have nice big long lines don 't do the little hairy lines just nice long lines if for whatever reason you don 't like that shape you can go over and you know try and even him out with some little lines but on the whole i think i 'm pretty happy with how he looks right there next step of room for our party hat so ears go either side and they 're little little hoops i 'm going to try and try and make them the same something like that so it 's not is it no matter what erasers were made for let 's see when you use your pencil don 't press too hard it 's hard to erase your lines again afterwards just really light this is a hb you use whatever you 've got softer pencils of course leave darker lines yeah now i want that one the same but harder pencils are sometimes harder to erase look i 'm gonna leave it with it i know it 's not the same but never mind okay so there 's our bear shape so we have next to do the party hat so the party hat 's really easy it is a triangle going up from his head i 'm gonna leave a little room at the top here like that there we go and i 'm gonna leave a little decoration at the top to do just in watercolors i don 't need to now the eyes on our bear and just little dots two little dots sort of down from the ears so if we find that line with the ears if we find that line with the ears so about there then we could put our eyes in and as i said two little dots that one looks a little higher we don 't want him to look at the sweet bear next step is the muzzle or his nose and mouth which is an oval with a d shape and a little smile underneath so we 'll do the oval first between the two eyes just underneath there we go d is about halfway would you say halfway lying face down capital d red nose and then we have a lovely happy birthday smile so there we are we 've got a got a bare shape there now as i said if you don 't have watercolors that 's fine you can go ahead and just color in with your pencils i 've got some lovely watercolors here and what 's handy is these watercolors come with a plastic lid which mixing colors because you never want to mix your colors here you want to keep these the colors they are always mix your colors somewhere else first thing is we 're going to paint the hat so let 's get some color on i think purple today watercolors need well lots of water there 's our water here when you use watercolors uh it 's always a good idea to put down some paper or in a place that 's easy to clean it 's also really handy to have some paper towel for cleaning your brush if you can it 's actually really good to have two containers of water too one that you wash your brush in one that you take water from i 've only got the one today that 'll do that 'll do now notice i haven 't erased my lines they 're gonna stay this bear is just he 's just an everyday bear he 's not a fancy bear a bit more water and decorate now you can see the more water you have the runnier the paint becomes which allows you to let 's do that like here or you can even sort of wash it out let me see that get a paper towel get a little dab and make it a bit lighter in that space so it 's like it 's got a bit of shape to it we 're giving our hats a bit of shape shape next color is bear color i 'm choosing to make my bear color just normal bear brown you can make your bear whatever color you like just remember uh we 're going to do some washing afterwards with a little bit of black in the color so whatever your color you use make sure it 's a lighter color so we can add some black to and do a bit of this shadow work right now we 're just filling in a big block of color so we 're going to do everywhere on our bear except the muzzle now i just went over the line is it a bad thing it 's your work i think it 's actually better if you for this to go over the lines and don 't leave them exposed get some color on them color all the way into there color over the line you can see each time i 'm adding color it starts darkening it 's lighter so you can always go over the top or add some water to an area that 's particularly dark yeah there that 's what i wanted so i needed some water up here sort of smooth that out a bit there we go nearly there and remember he 's a bear he can be a bit shaggy if you 're doing fish you might actually do the painting as little scales but i 'll leave that up to you we 're doing bears today okay so there 's all the brown now i promised you we were going to use a little black to make darker brown i 'll show you again for these shadows here so either side of bear 's head from his ears all the way down we 're going to take some of whatever color his body is and we 're going to add a little black now start with a once you add it look see i 'll put it down here can you see once you add it it makes it really really dark i 'm trying to work quickly here because we want to put this on while our bear is still wet okay so let 's go this is called wet on wet technique and we do this because it blends in the dark color and the light color and if i put some more white water and it 's starting to dry out there we go it blends in those two colors so you don 't even notice that there is two colors it 's just bare okay now our hat is dry i 'm going to do the second of our techniques which is wet on dry now for this one i 'm going to put a little decoration for our original bear he has blue polka dots on a red background uh i 'm going to do let 's see i 'll do blue again needs to be darker if you want to use a lighter dots you will have to leave holes spaces a darker color we can just go straight over the top and do dot start start starts all over the hats and now i 'll put in my streamers new yeah looks pretty good now i 'm not doing it all the time i must admit but a lot of the time i am washing my brush and then drying it uh good thing to remember especially if you don 't want to mix mix up your colors now our bear is nearly complete we have a couple more things to do oh i forgot something with our our darker brown have you spotted it yet here 's a hairy bear i 'll just put in some some stripes to show his fur there we go okay now we can do the black now this is we 're sort of coloring in like we would do with a texture here so we don 't need a lot of water on our black just enough to get some on the brush you want a nice fine point if you can get it i have a very dry room here my paint can be that way and wiggle i 'm gonna make it cheeky there we go okay there 's our beard how did you do why don 't you try some watercolors they 're great fun and you can see how simple this bear was maybe you can do some other animals just like him _"

    "text": "hey guys welcome to another video of the simple chef today we 're going to make something super easy and simple and be ready in 15 minutes chicken lab in lettuce cups so let 's begin so to start off with ingredients guys over here I have shallots coriander ginger chicken mince freshly cracked pepper trust me it makes a big difference in food lettuce which we got a total lettuce cups salt garlic lemongrass kaffir lime leaves lime brown rice which is going to take its places with white rice to make sure it 's healthier chilli mint and then over here a nice mix peanut oil fish sauce in so begin what we 're gonna do is slice the white bit of the shalat and then later once you do that use the green bit to slice it as thin as possible and then chop it up a little bit more once you 've sliced the white part of shalad next take your ginger take the skin off and finely chop that as well now once that 's done I 'm gonna do the same with the kaffir lime leaves if I 'll be cutting them into nice individual strips add in your brown rice and your water now to this what you 're going to do is add in your white shallots your ginger and your kaffir lime leaves and add in a bit of salt at the same time so once that 's done bring the water to a really high boil and boil it for about good five minutes and once that 's done bring it to a simmer on a very low heat cover it and let it just cook away till there 's no bite to the rice now if there still abide what you can do is add some more water and let it cook now once that 's done add in your green shallot and give it a good nice mix through and you can also remove the kaffir lime leaves if you want to but there you go that 's the rice component done for the lab now I 'm gonna really dice up the chiles for the lab and cut it into really tiny bits then with the lemongrass it along the line and then cut it into two strips because I will be taking them out later or if you really want to keep the lemongrass in your lab you can dice them up quite finely and just mix it through with the chicken then finally I 'm just gonna roughly chop up the kaffir lime leaves because these are something you 'll be taking off so keep them in big chunks also what I 'm gonna do is press it down slightly just to Bruce them so all those amazing kaffir lime leaf flavors will flow through your chicken now for the garlic it 's gonna peel the outside skin then I 'm going to chop it up for anything now what we gonna do is the most essential bin now we 're gonna separate the lettuce leaves so what I 'm gonna do over here is I 'm going to take off the most outer leaves which are really soft and you can just eat them as a peanut butter like I actually do all the time it 's actually amazing guys and then what I the lettuce bunch so the end will actually loosen up all the leaves it 'll be much easier for you to pull apart without tearing all the leaves now taking a nonstick pan add some sesame oil or peanut oil but if oil you have a hand and to this I 'm gonna add my garlic kaffir lime leaves and a bit of the chili once you 've added all you ingredients then just saute it around for about two to three minutes just to get all those amazing flavors into the oil and then to this mix you 'll be adding your chicken mince now the chicken means can be a little bit difficult to work with compared to beef mince so take your time and break it apart in the oil and as its cooking just keep mixing it around and pulling apart the big chunks of chicken that 's being cooked now if you would like to take out your pieces of lemongrass that 's what I 'm gonna do over here but you 've diced it up just leave it in there because as it cooks it but I still don 't like it in my chicken so I 'm just gonna take the big pieces of lemongrass that I 've cut through and then finally to the chicken I 'm gonna add my soy sauce and sugar mixture and cook it through for another three to five minutes till it gets thick so guys this is where the fun begins now you can take all the ingredients you 've made to the table and everyone can do it there while you have a nice jolly good time or you can do with the kids and get them to make dinner because it 's such an easy recipe to put together at the end so over here what I 'm gonna do is I 'll be putting two to three tablespoons off the cooked brown rice into the lettuce and then on to the top I 'll be putting about two to three tablespoons off the chicken now you can change the quantities around so you can either put more chicken and less rice or more rice and less chicken whatever you would like I usually then to finish it off I 'm just going to put a sprinkle of the mint and coriander and some of the chili and then a nice squeeze of the lemon juice on the top now there 's two ways of serving this you can either serve it just open like this or what I would like to do sometimes it actually turned into nice little parcels so I 'll bring one side in other side and then close it over and wrap it up how easy was that guys an easy healthy parcel to eat now keep repeating to use up all the ingredients and this will be ready for a quick and easy dinner when you come from a long day after work if you enjoyed this recipe do not forget to comment like share and most importantly hit that subscribe button for more easy 15 30 minute recipes let me know how this recipe goes and take care and I 'll see you next time bye _"

freak wave wash me clean off the deck right why not freak weather wash me off right but the old catwalk be terrible lots of sailors swinging it over I hate this is growing up and or beverage here so dang cold right you don 't bother swimming because it frees endeavor anyway right so you never bother we learn and so a lot of sale is once you 're over the day you 're pretty gone right there 's not much going on after that right tell me how much of a but the old captain he 'd be a brave old soul the old county had their cap not too thin read from the all the herald right what he did is he grabbed the main she great remember the sheet so the ones at the end of one there are the end of the boom there on the old you know for to IRC like that one there and this is the there 's rope on there 's the captain 's here right he 's grabbed on me and great bein brainy 's it main sheet right remember the sheets at ropes right he 's grabbing and he 's leapt off the ship right this is him tell stories bleeding after ship and as they 're going for my friends going single Abbas there 's he 's going back those people for the current watch specifics a aware of us he 's leapt off and grabbed me by the hair right he 's grabbed me by the hair and then the crew will have the other end of the street right there open port and they pull him back to the show right make Photo Story pulled him right back to the Saudi drain and then both grab the sewing wow that 's great Jews like I said but he said oh well you see what happened was they 're all so excited about the cabin right cuz cabins not supposed to leave the ship you let 's say they don 't can wash it off in their real royal DAV you get annoyed trouble better private ground they say the captain should leave the ship to be the rest right that 's what you know part it 's weird people are friendly you know so they 'll drag him off for the role collect late and slap these back and these go hey man no weird hey saying oh don 't be so lazy and I forget throw your leg over why it 's really late already said no don 't be stupid alright then so what now I know your legs what happened I reached over recess and I grabbed the boy in Pinole he 's grabbed the boy and could run away and pin pins to go into the little fox there 's all the seals on that he 's pulling himself already the party 's over but then what happened was the wave and swell now you don 't when you 're at the beach right you got the surf with the crashing waves well that another times it 's just a bee Roy 's a water but no actual Sophie fluffy bits that 's a swell untidy out water was a shark and it bit his leg clean off of him clean it off oh he screeched he 's had any rot daughter they pulled him over town how did you lose your hand in the shock take that as well no no he says no no no I didn 't do that I got me a wooden leg you know the copper come on knock me up a really nice wood leg you stick around because I always make some laughs there you think so he 's not at all they said no but I lost what happened was my pants kept falling down right because when the sheriff take my leg it took me bail cop goes well right from people walk away so I figure what I 'll do is I 'll called me a fresh one I 've been assaulted beef rare to me how hard that pits are all beat so he 's our baby someone wishes people nowadays we 've got a really odd piece of beef right to be never oh good on eight months right okay I 'll show not be broke it was so hard he said it was so hard he broke his butter knife on it right so then he decided to use these cutlets right you see his Cutlass your cut that 's right remember your Cutlass big one that is you use that right he 's used that to sharpen it up like took over nobody 's car and all these colors but it 's still hard and shiny still a hardened shorty so it has to be bloated he 's cutlets right so he hadn 't quite finished so he thought he should take a stone to his colors that were used to sharpen him with right whatever a little stopping and stone right anybody running it across that hat to get a keen blade they call it I mean oh he 's in for you sharpener with your ACC opener waving what happening right some blowing a rat come on this huge pretty rad come back and grab his belt buckle he says it just was the hair come across the neck that even green if they grab me belt buckle what you he says I was so infuriated I thought oh I 'm gonna give that rat a damn good ticket right and so he 's going for a big swing and he 's gonna work what happened was of course yeah at this point he stick on the end remember these pirates because all fancy they leave pointed sticks but not good for kicking he 's got a straight pass a trap so I 'm going around his legs going up and he 's gonna fall and back down like flapping back down like completely knocked seems all worried I remember I said oh he was sharpening up the old Cutlass right so he didn 't have a proper grip on it so he 's going down he 's armed swallow up right not a proper grip and the sort of slow alexandrite these blades is full up I mean this guy he said I watched it say no pop I reached its apex the peak is just sitting up there just sat there for a while and then gravity Gold all right gravity took off and it come back between the sky and the deck was his hand off so that 's no good or you might have lost the battle Blackbeard or something so he didn 't like that but no no you lost it a lot oh I said but what about your Oyen what happen to you honey how 'd you lose your eyes come over to point it out oh that bastard old thing said oh no no no oh no no no he says no that didn 't do that what happened was easy what happened was he was back on duty right oh yeah just go put them on right you know I bought a honky to show you I don 't want that you owe me one of these before these are kind of oaks I use right back myself you 're a little bit there that goes over the stove wee bit on the top you do that just so you got a feel or he says sorry so let 's back up my job you know we swap on the deck some of the next so I swung by the know he said hurt somebody I thought I heard him calling my name and I looked up I suppose I looked up the skin and it was oh bugger an old bugger you memory all four first mate Wilson right the parrot it was him so I looked up at him and as I looked up the blighter hey poot in Hawaii he pooped down me are you what I said what did he be they even it was that powder at your eye out why did he be needin that would that be hard tack really our tech said no no no wasn 't that you see I still wasn 't really used to be oak and you know what I went to rub it out and well well you in the picture so that 's how he got it so I ask you is that being a good party was that just dang Tom 's a game uh-huh it 'd be a sad story you know we were playing cards off to inside right he was going really badly and threw his hand in haha of course I with partner you know he was still a good part that 's the thing with part you know you know you know you lose one hand and you all right now swabbing I talked about swab anemia so up in the next year about at all we 're told you say those are even cool swabs or swabbies you know cuz they were swabbing the decks all the time what 's swab of the necks what 's amazing we just bought from the decks going a swab is just basically a stick with a bit of absorbance up at the end like you know you have those swabs they do like when these testing for kind of stuff you know they tested on that right so that kind of thing that 's like a very bit on the end but we 'd have like rope tie in and the rags and stuff on the end of a stick can you be swabbing there with water and we do it now all the time so what 's the point of clean and all the time is getting water across that 's to keep it there and keep it clean right because the water remember I talked about the taupe so the barrels of water right you know you wouldn 't drink water cuz you drink the Roman that that 's tough because water you get slimy after time let 's say you if the worse it another this get slimy and it gets all slippery gets all slippery will all be sliding off that 's why do you imagine we go hard about right turn you the direction go out about I never had slow leads off the deck they 're all they 're full no way the ship keeps on going where 's that would be a nightmare if you knowing me I 'd tell you annoyed man but it 's all okay they 're right that what we do we clean the deck so every day they swab the deck you know same as you here I 'm cleaning the bilges bottom of the ship probably the builders the bottom of the champagne irritability the bilge pump see those kind of expression trade that 's way down the bottom over goes down holes and goes into bleats every now maybe it 's leaks and coke and gets the Caulkins of it some they saw into the ship there they join the wood together keep it from leaking in so and water it get in there so we have pumps air and yet ban the pumps right then you be there you can put away and be on the water demand the Wolpaw bilges and that was a real stinky place down there because no windows in the bilge and all that kind stuff so weren 't the best place to be that 's the dope you didn 't want to do be man in the middle Trump usually do that as a punishment you know me misbehaving or telling bad jokes like before you know that 's what you do know what buddy anyway that be legs 11 last thing we 're gonna write before we finish this one is 13 is coming up great their routines coming up next one be 12 or flat be 13 and what we 're gonna do there is have a treasure hunt it is easy right these are where they bury the treasure right you have all the locations self around there right there okay so what you got to do at home right what you got to do at home is draw up a map of your either your house inside your in so any times or outside in your backyard and so on if you gotta backyard or a park or so what I 'm at right and what you do if you draw up your own little map I bet I put an X away were you gonna hold the treasure and then when we meet together on the 13 amp is alright right I 'll go through them and I 'll tell you you know white pieces as well you know that sort of stuff oh go and willfully do treasure in your place and find a treasure of my place and we 're all fine Jason again here right well pieces of eight coming out our ears hahaha then there is one here is you know other people keep their acts up another ways because they 're ear is made by the camera div and I don 't know why they do that cuz I find it gives me splinters every time I scratch my ear if I 've got a wood here that is the story which why you come to me later I don
