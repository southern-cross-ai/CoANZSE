    "text": "what 's or public participation decision of the council and we have to know of so the forensic Club debaters Angela Macpherson and Bruce italic welcome oh you 've just got five minutes tip welcome clean okay you 've got five minutes to do with as you wish and a very warm welcome to you thank you very much for going us the opportunity to talk to Julie I 'm Angela Macpherson and this is Bruce italic and we are here to talk about a debating Club we belong to which is called forensic club and for the last 125 years the club has operated under the radar in Christchurch in that we have not publicized ourselves or actively sought new members now we have room to increase our membership and so we are here to let Christchurch know that we exist and what we do also as the only woman member I 've realized some company the forensic club was founded in Christchurch in 1890 and since the unit 's held me meetings during the winter from april through September the only occasions that meetings have ever been missed and the bar war for a period during the First World War and one night in 1970 when ice on the roads stop transport meetings are held on thursday evenings usually fortnightly and the normal format is a debate these speakers have up to 20 minutes to put their case and second speakers ten minutes the topic is then thrown open to contributions from the floor and leave us some up and the performance is voted on the results are taken lightly it is not who wins or loses as how you play the game the term forensic is of legal origin meaning the examination of evidence and the club holds that every person has to education one which they receive from others and one more importantly that they give to themselves and now with one eye on the clock I 'll hand over to my second speaker right well the club 's been going for quite a long time and the success of this and the participation and contribution that members have made to Christchurch into New Zealand those are we doing a fairly good job it 's an in the debates it 's an opportunity for people to get up and speak on a topic for 20 minutes for the lead speakers which is quite intimidating when you start but you rapidly learn to tailor your talk to the audience you 're learn to think on your feet you learn to rebut the other side to pick out the good points now these are vital skills and thus day and age because concise clear communication is essential you know this very well in the City Council a couple of examples of problems with communication where the furore over closing some of the suburban libraries to about ten years ago and more recently the Victoria Square kerfuffle and it took a little while before we were able to pull public consultation discussion and come up with very good solutions in both cases now this is the sort of the thing the forensic type can teach me we might bike Toastmasters we don 't train people and speaking but it 's an opportunity to practice and the sympathetic audience 20 minutes for the lead speaker 10 minutes for the second for anybody who wants to contribute so you learn to listen to think and respond accordingly we all know how important letters and this day of leather and spin doctoring and everything else so we have a membership maximum of 40 we 're not up to that these days modern life has meant that people can 't get along as often as they used to however we have space for new members and we would courage people are interested to come along here what we do decide whether the like join or not and generally increase their ability to take part in social and civic events around the city so we have some information here I 'll leave copies on the table outside the door and will be emailing information to the counselors as well if anybody would like more details get in touch as let us know so it 's educational it trains you up in important skills and the tail a lot of fun and it wouldn 't you mind very much fantastic now we don 't normally have time for questions but we do on your occasion be a youngest member is probably around about fuji rock right and he 's very committed and and comes up with some great ideas and also is circulated everybody with ideas about us going on facebook which at the moment is a little step too far i think i think that he 's taking care of the facebook your foray into facebook is already about to happen um and so you 're going to have to set up your own page for everyone to life thank you very much for using this public participation part to tell us about the forensics debating club I just think it 's a fantastic concept to be actually teaching people about critical listening and speaking and I just think that that analysis is sometimes lost and the demand for a 10 second sound bite so thank you so much for coming you write the next well seedling go jo daviess good morning commander self the counselors staff the public key passes crew rock on so since 2011 there 's been a lot of tension between central government and the council mostly questions over the 'm past looking at these disagreements and feeling critical or cynical towards the situation we haven 't present now maybe we need to look forward not backwards i feel as though we need to think outside of the box littleton is built over 150 years ago a lot of its stonework by the prison neighbor from the jail and crisis was settled not long after because of the fertile land space here and for people to build these model wide Road of towels that long ago what 's holding us back from building housing and our city now and not just housing but nice architecture you know with european-style departments of nice Spanish facades we have such modern technology we have such standards in place to build world-class infrastructure that will survive the test of time but we seem to be waiting to something is a private development and anchor projects so our board the happy fairy community board we had a briefing last Monday from Fletcher living to are fulfilling the government development in the Eastern frame and I 'm going to admit some of the architecture was interesting a treat to live by but the representative from Fletcher living did dutifully admitted the lowest price apartments going to be half a million dollars now that might seem like a good pop at the moment but it 's only for those who can already afford it people whom society has given that privilege the crux of it and in New Zealand our term of housing is assuming it reflects a a country where there was a lot of space at time of people had big garden but urbanization has occurred immigration to a poor management has led to a housing crisis nationally and it 's being blown up in Auckland this week which is good to have that debate and it 's simple there 's not enough supply and there 's huge demand internally and externally now we have such an opportunity to stop auckland from ever happening in christchurch one measure could be when council could create a non for profit entity use five plots that it has in the CBD or acquire them if need be and build an array of basic 1-bedroom 1-bathroom european-style departments you a range between 100 and 200 2,000 connect them of green spaces and paths and give young people and couples the biggest opportunity of a lifetime and Sweden their word for apartment it doesn 't really exist in English bus towards that means to purchase the right to live in a flat you buy a share in the building now you can find a busted set and any major town or city in Sweden for less than a million kronor which translates to two hundred thousand dollars you can get some finesse you I 've seen some on their equivalent of ebay yesterday for forty grand now this concept may differ significantly from our ideas of four bedroom single storage structures but for a moment let 's think about a different concept of housing because human development isn 't just abide by the culture that we exist in its action and we need to build a city like our forefathers and foremothers who built our roads and cities they didn 't wait for things for happen they built it with their hands and they built it with their imaginations and at this time a hands on people led recovery thank you very much and there is time for a couple of questions of people want to i 'm glenn and info thank you Joe good to hear that and you you know landing on a figure and I I started a question it then I realized we you know at home pill to sleep out for under 50,000 with the foundational requirements two bedrooms bathroom so how have you arrived at a hundred thousand which is very cheap for one bedroom one bathroom how do you yeah that 's just that 's just you know translation from from similar situations in Europe where you know and even the property values over them and housing our size is far greater than ours here but these apartments there they 're very small they 're three rooms you know like the the living space and the bed in the same area the kitchen is small it 's it 's just a different a different type of housing yeah you 're thinking of City a hundred is doable absolutely okay thank you yes yeah deputations my appointment I haven 't_''_657.59 because the banners wound up at the time that Joe came to the table I just want the people who who are putting them up at the moment just to reflect on the public participation and the distraction to people who come in to the table to make their position mode it would be better if you saved it to when the public are not participating at this part and in presenting case as you are doing as a silent protest at the council business because i think that is unfair and disrespectful to the people who are coming forward to use this as an opportunity to speak to the council that time on affordable housing the next deputation is in relation to a contractor parking permits for residential homes and I just I just ask people to reflect on whether that is respectful to people who are coming forward to speak to the council absolutely no objection to silent protest I think it 's a great idea there 's something wrong with our democracy if we didn 't allow it I 'm just the people who 've made appointments come to the council to speak on that is important to them so on that note can I call forward dr. Stewart darlin thank you to the council for the opportunity to speak to again I brought with me Andrew some just to let you know there 's more than one resident in homewood row and our talk today is really pushing for a trial of a parking permit system which we think is fair which we think is useful and which we think may have an opportunity to spread further across Christchurch in the future it 's not really we sort of seemed to be going down of preparing for a policy type thing I 'm saying no you should do the trial and that would lead to how your policies formulated if you want to in the future so far two of your sub groups engineers and others have looked at this and said there 's no need to change we in homewood Road believe we have quite a bit of skin in the game we were involved when the proposal to increasing traffic flow and parking requirement went ahead despite our warnings that there would be a parking problem and year and a half later there is a parking problem it 's been dealt with by limited parking 120-minute parks in the eastern end of Homer wrote up towards home was lame but for some of us that 's quite a problem in the main problem isn 't that our own personal parking because we quite accept the rule that your your private vehicles should be parked on your own property as long as that 's possible this is now contractors who come to do various tasks we have people that come once a week gardens and people quite big vehicles too big to get down our driveway and we have arborists to come probably a couple of times a year again with vehicles of too big to go down our driveway so we would follow an example set by the devon county council where it was possible to get people certified to be able to use a permit the permit then goes to the home owner and in the Devon at the same time but different people that could be there so might have a gardener an arborist of something else or something else where you might only have two people the they would use this permit they would get from you when they came to your place put it in the windscreen and the enforcers our friends would be able to look through the windscreen and see if that kind of fitted with the number plate they wouldn 't be allowed to get on the permit unless they have had their documentation sent to the council that they were a proper commercial provider of some sort so so far the objections have been more along as if it was for private cars to go out there this is commercial vehicles you can 't park on the property because generally their vehicles are too big to go down with driveways do those properties that 's the first thing the second thing is but they can get a permit as a one-off but when do these guys come as a one-off they 're always depended on whether and various other things and say we can come in two days time we can come one day time well at night too late to get a permit if they say two days time will it be fine in two days time so to us to have a permanent permit available it would have to be renewed yes here and that 's what we 're on about two reasons why we think we need them commercial people too big a vehicle to get down driveways etc and the fact that it 's very difficult with people that are working outside to cope with weather and to be able to guarantee that a particular date you 've got your permit for well it should be the date they 're there and that 's the burden of my song um no and in LA calling-thanks Stewart um I just wanted what from a different model how in fact they that council deals with enforcement when for example there 's in the abuse of the system or some some sort of fraudulent use by other people who are not how they just little commercial contractors okay so document that goes in from the council with the number plates on it they also have to put as a written thing themselves on the day what their they are doing which has to fit with the arrangements that have been made for them I think if your gardening it 's going to be gardening so that no there 's any point big deal about that basically they 're armed forces will ticket people who do not fit with the number plate and the use of the vehicle okay and I just wanted to though if F in fact council don 't move towards of the permit system if there 's any ways that you well ways that you think perhaps that the current system might be improved adequately so for example so that all contractors would know about that the current council process well i think it 's i think the contractors find it difficult now we 've got a different situation at the moment than i was really originally talking about which was after the earth we 've got a lot of earthquake repairs which is quite a and letting people go through it went quite so generous with my wife but it probably shouldn 't have been although he had moved out of our driveway until it the commercial people didn 't God give it DVD I think it 's way beyond even as I find out in the UK so it has spread across the UK quite significantly for parking again we are happy that residential vehicles should be on your own property that 's fine so there isn 't an easy thing that the council 's got at the moment than a one-off permit for a day that they could use and they 've got these difficulties i 'm mentioning already about being able to predict the day so just led to please it 's the the issue is that very issue because the council 's obviously saying we have a system of works and you 're suggesting that in fact it doesn 't because of the flexibility that 's required that 's the main issue well well you haven 't had a chance to see it not working really i mean be my next 's what we 're talking about we 're talking only about a trial we 're not wanting you to start doing policy on the hoof and the trial we would hope would lead you to be able to gather some information that might help the people that have don 't change anything continuity wise though we can see with the earthquakes and the repairs particularly around that part of Miravalle and Homewood row there 's been some huge work near do you see this dealing with only bad or you 'd mentioned gardens do you see no no we started this on the basis of post-earthquake now it 's a more complex issue with the earthquake I mean there are people there for a week at a time in two weeks at a time and all sorts of other things there may be some way to ease things for them I think your wardens have been generous so far for most of them but it was unfortunate that the people who were interviewed about what a great system they thought it was had smoked more dope on their t-shirts however people is a tricky thing to deal with we don 't have a clear way to do that but remember our bit of Homewood row as in the photograph on the front now here 's 120 minutes put on it we are the guys that said there 's going to be a parking problem we were told there will not be a problem now there is a parking problem we think we 've got some skill in the game and we 've made an effort to come up with an innovative solution and we would rather move on from let 's not change anything because it is a problem thank you I 'm Pauline all right thank you I 'm just a couple of questions like probably semantics but you talked about number plates being on the Puma yes so if you wanted to get a permit for your gardener and you 're a burruss remover yeah you 'd have to have the number plates of their vehicle yes we would the what if there was a bigger company and I use different vehicles how do you get around dead tough on that one that one vehicle is going to be certified all right and then the UM Devon model you talked about is there a time frame like your four hours half a day a whole day I don 't know how long yes you can they would allow them to park for a day I 'm clearly if they finish their work unless the day they 're not going to hang around just to use up their parking space holiday yes if they want yeah maybe thanks thank you sir I accept that there is a problem we 've seen it first and we 're well aware of it unfortunately um I think the trial makes a lot of scenes so policy on the fly not not so much but we can actually see if this this could could solve it would you be opposed to a cost for the to apply for one of these permits just to help offset the implementation expenditure well to get it going I probably would not be opposed you 'd be fine so I don 't know pick a number but this yeah yeah for one of these booklets it is part of the trial yep okay 14 seconds not what we go over time look thank you very much we 've got one more deputation and then we 've a group but then we 'll come back to the paper because the next paper is on the next deputations on another paper but obviously there 'll be some debate around or so if you 'd like to stay or go for the debate it will be dealt with at annex deputation thank you so the next deputation is for the can feel they can 't agree indoor bowls Association cousin Troy anybody 's research oh okay right right but internet some date David filters in David oh sweet yes Oh coming few but thank you thank you for the opportunity I 'm David Bullock daughters prison of Kennedy and no bowls and over philpott am I right here 's our financial advisor the cannery indoor bowls association was established in the mid-1940s and ninety-four t9 the City Council top became a member you have a current membership of 800 which over 90 and 36 clubs at all as in the central place for all 10 of the indoor bowls and those books are hosts national and South Arlen events national events later on this year will bring 150 and 250 people respectively into the district where York 's our hosts special olympics pain and or bowls it 's the only or large enough to accommodate at the moment they 've had to move out in the home place with a county accommodate about half the number so they 're looking forward to coming back to air all wheels yeah we 've also been approached by Bochy you want to put down a quart or two courts next to our building and use the facility they are willing to work with us and also it 's a national sport where zindel boulders we pay internationals against Australia but we don 't go to olympic games and things like that the hall is used by members and non-members for functions and meetings as it and as an integral part of the community the council uses our car park area for the linfield filled in at the back of Cal Stadium the bowling hall at 25 cooney 's road was damaged on the twenty-second of febri 2010 given earthquake our current insurance tower insurance began scoping the repair work unfortunately they decided they would not repair the building and instead player setup reasoning was that they did not undertake projects as large as ours originally terror approached us and they to get a membership list to clients for house and contents insurance policies they did that too I think all the outdoor bowling clubs in the country so having that we thought we should ensure our building through tower which we did for ever think 15 years that any problems but it was when they looked at it far greater than any other building they 'd had to repair so they took that way up this ocean went association was paid out the insurance and proceeded with reverb appear there appear was proceeding well unto until the fire on the nineteenth of September 2014 in the foiler Prince re FOIA toilet area caption our area and lana 's were all destroyed this area between the foyer and the pain area stop the fire enough for the fire breaks brigade to get the fire under control and save the bowling area the at that stage we had labor new for it had to be at the top coat on it but that had to be relayed visit of water and day and heat damage the insurance the builders insurance cover that sort of thing but doesn 't cover any of the other but because it wasn 't the fire was not her in though with the builders they weren 't actually weaken and they the area that was been the worst when our Arctic came up the draft plan for a new area attached to the volume camellia this plan went to counter for conceit and after adjustments was sent to our repairers to cry start there were significant additional costs that arose to counsel with Christian soon our items they had to be changed in a plan the rebuild is now three weeks away from being fully completed we 've had long delays and sit in the bike lane in the game council to the fire last year we achieve fifty percent national building standard for the building and part of the 15 2015 and as such we now have full insurance covering the building till the end it was still a large worry that our friend if I might come back doesn 't thankfully we 've been we have a security and fire alarm off Reagan we 've been proactive and seeking grants from various organizer patients during the year but in recent times we haven 't been successful we are seeking a loan for 135,000 in the council 's we 're short for thur appear so that we may get the hall up and running for a members and community use any grant to reduce the amount of immensely help title loan and put a lot of stress I would put a lot of stress on the administrators and members I would take it off hear me but I 'd like to add that was the that was the arson attack in September 2014 the treaty caused all this problem and stress for us in the money we receive from the also have a surplus but after that after the fire we have we 've managed to try and get grants there was a large grant that we thought we 'd get this year but then to understand hints that 's why we 're coming here now to apply for a loan 435,000 to have it fixed in the papers that you 've been given you 'll see the fire damage there if you look up up there on the the board there we 've actually got I 've just put some photos as well of what assets you look looking right now so it just to be up there that 's the the kitchen area there you can see out there that again as a part of the kitchen area where was fitting that was done about three weeks ago that that photograph again that 's the other part of the kitchen area that we 've got and that 's the bar area okay so I 've got a bar on one in kitchen the other in a lounge and then hits the the bar area there and then I that shows all the the completed items there that 's what looks like as of two days ago I went down there so all that stuff in the front there 's all been rebuilt so it 's coming along quite good that 's the floor so all the floor now has been redone and inside and it 's it 's got to be at one more coat and seen him to go anything that could be played on it is the only purpose built indoor bowls Hall in New Zealand which is quite phenomenal the exhumed indoor bowls Federation they really do want to use our facility because we can host a national events as well as inter-district between all other districts between South and North Island so they were trying to promote our hall so we really do need to get that run in terms weekend so that 's where at at the moment and that 's that 's the new entrance way that we 've got so all we we 've just got a bit of concreting to do at the front and put the paraplegic karapakkam for where it at the moment all right and I don 't know how much time we 've got oh look on 1 minute 16 secret so Phil I think this given the importance of indoor bowling and the numbers involved in the contribution I 'm hoping to the support from counselors for what you 're asking I 'm just wondering no just you 're also saying that a grant would also be useful and where I 'm coming from is if we 're to look at a grant we may need more time to look at which wich part of council funding we obtain that grand from so hell are you up clear there 's been a long road but are you able to wait a little longer so we clarify how we can press offer you the best help unfortunately no we probably looking for the loan first in then if there 's any option that we can get a grant to reduce debt loan it 'll be much appreciated to avoid the stress of the other members and the administrators thank you yep so you mentioned sorry yep rather that there is some international tests between New Zealand and Australia and that happens every two years and that this poor would be obviously the place that are displayed is it 's the only purpose built basically would be used because it 's large enough to hold it click in to run into zone mindless Australia and how many people would be to know is given us numbers because of initials sorry off so you have time okay well we 'll quit this I feel like mastermind questions being asked you know 13 yeah all right the numbers of that when we run Nationals we can have up to 200 well the 600 competitors come to come to christ church for that when we if we run the inter national tournament okay we 're probably have about two to three hundred people turn up with the players in the supporters in Australia as well as use Elam okay so it 's quite a good influx of people into Christ you thank you very much thank you very much and we 're just going to move quickly to item number back I think that the people have worked very hard to come up with a resolution that will resolve this matter so if you can take thank you very much for your dictation thank you very much if councillors could move to item number 17 there is a an additional wrecking _"

    "text": "if you can take thank you very much for your deputation thank you very much if councillors could move to item number 17 there is a an additional recommendation being included on the set of resolutions and that so the paper as you can see receives the information than the report it approves a loan of 135,000 over a 10-year repayment tomb at delegates authority to require such security from the indoor bowls Association but then also requests a report to the next council meeting on funding for Canterbury I don 't think that an amount that should be there I think we should actually just put their that requested on funding underground water on on a funding grant on funding for kendry under from the so just take the amount out because I think we actually have to get a report on what the alternatives are so what we 've heard very clearly from the bowl bowls club is that they need the sign off on the loan so they 've got the assurity to move ahead but they actually would like the council to consider a funding grant over and above one no no no it is to reduce the letters to reduce the reliance on the line and that came through very clearly and presentation yesyes could we just maybe just tweak then approve a loan of 135 to just just add in the words up 200 years approved a loan of up to I can then engage the solicitors to start preparing an agreement yeah while we work on the other one yeah right yes right so would someone like two losers yeah Annie second up by Paul is there any discussion just yonni just quickly um just certainly just went to speak in support of this and I just want to make three very quick reasons why what is that this is really you know it was a really unfortunate series of events which has led the club to being in this position or the association and i think it 's it 's really important that we provide the support just for two main reasons one is that it 's really great to see that this is activating an area in the east of the around these zealand people from across the Tasman and secondly because and kind of related to that as they 're actually we also use this land in terms of the car park for council sport and Rick and the bowling indoor bowls Association has been very good to us as a council in terms of allowing us to use their car park for community events and in conclusion really just to say you know the fact that the Special Olympics will have a home and a place where they can go as well i think is a great a great thing about about this into a space we know there 's a lack of indoor space in the city and would just be so good to get this happening and I 've done a huge amount of work Palmer eyes local councils have worked with them and I 'd really encourage you to support this today thank you thank you I r if you have two questions um no no no no no we 're debating wait yeah sorry so we do mr. by questions well I didn 't think don 't have a problem with it I don 't understand the financials they 're just not presented properly but if further people have to live it on for I 'm support i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye as opposed to know that scary _"

  {
    "text": "you the pain that we 're talking about that 's in this year 's budget it is not a next year 's budget so if you could move on to the rest of the submission okay well anyway that 's why view there on the sale of it I think you very foolish ship the other thing though is information provided I thank you I 'm not privy to what the staff advised you in public excluded meetings but when I happened to see earlier this year councillor Goths facebook page and exactly it 's very serious concern yeah believe everything on facebook the auditors categorically said that they would be unable to sign off the council 's budget long-term plan ltp unless we could point to a tangible asset sale process I actually write to the your auditor Julian Ted and he passed it on to the office of the order to general and I thought via the letter I sent to home we passed on and also their reply there concerning order faith I have also written through the council and asked what information was given to the what was happening there remain on me that they would be waiting for the 20-day to expire before they release set which happens to be monday so i can 't tell you what they 're gonna tell me minami I 'm sorry Lindsay for interrupting but just a respectful point of order he 's lodged no I a of which and staff are complying with in the supplying that information for him that he seeks and that 's all fine but again this isn 't related to the annual fan this is jonathan 's with the 1617 any know then you 've got the auditors reply here which is perfectly clear which it says that if the auditor felt the counsels approach to financial management was unreasonable we would have commented on this and the relevant audit report the approach taken by the council in this case this case the sale of assets as a policy matter for the council to make the auditors not comment on the merits of that policy it 's not the point that Jamie was making in his post what Janie was saying was the the council 's budget the only way you can do that is to look at the value of the assets and the only way you can guarantee that you can release capital from those assets as through the value of their shares so so what Jamie said is correct and what the Auditor General said is correct as well so it was a policy decision we made but as you can see from the budget that we have put forward this time we are absolutely positive that we won 't have to release any capital by way of selling shares and our strategic assets okay well anyway I 'm just quite concerned over what staff were telling you there yeah I don 't know where the 200 millions on the sell price of petrol I didn 't really I didn 't realize you were being naughty so no monetary option on the submission well ls8 there you know no but I 've already said the submissions actually out of order as far as not going to sit here goes so but I thought that it was worthwhile saying that both said but that 's because they 're talking about two different approaches and they 're different responsibilities so carry on well that 's really just about it there but I 've got there just that that the staff seem to have they do seem to have a fairly single-minded view on this and that is for sale of these particular assets no no that if you read the financial strategy and there 's a new financial strategy that we are consulting on now and it says that it does say that we are looking at alternative ways of making capital available in terms of the capital release other than selling shares on our strategic assets well I still think there 's a bit of a smoke and mirrors attitude going on and they have went when you 're having these meetings were bottled Chancellor God said on his Facebook page was quite concerning without my name is Eric right it is a desert it is a friendly way of describing what is technically correct so it is not a it is not a technical document it would never have been it that way myself but it 's that the truth of it is is that what Jamie says is create in what the auditor says is correct as well but we are absolutely confident that we are not going to be requiring to sell assets as shares and our strategic assets in order to meet our capital release obligations which are now significantly lower than what they were a year ago before we got our global insurance settlement and before we started to review and great detail our capital program we 're going to run out of time all right i 'll leave that then to put that for once I dream but I do have concerns about what goes on some of these public explicitly service what I 've realized yet like to raise I didn 't actually put it in the submission but I would like to just mention it that is that you may well be aware that I 've been involved and the proposed to district plan to do with saving prestige is notable in heritage trees now I 'm not going to any pose what a group of people we 've been having to raise funds to pay for experts witnesses and lawyers beans and all that and these things do not come cheap I would like put to you request that the council establish a community planning fun the community groups and residents associations can 't can apply to for funding to participate and district planning processes so that they can then access expert witnesses and lawyers has required an order to participate and that such a suggestion I would like to see something like that done because it 's extremely difficult to go fundraising for these issues they come up this one is costing what over 30,000 daughters we 've had to fundraise thank you very much and you 've just got 20 000 and and for those staff will make a note of it because it wasn 't included in your submission so we 'll make a note of that I am here on another piece of paper well that 's that 's fine if you can hand that over to staff after okay afterwards could I invite Cathy Morris Morris Morris of the page oh sorry Jim Jim Jim the house key good Irish new sorry I thought you worked there I thought you were with the group after you so I grouped you and when they said they 'd gone I I 'd assumed you 'd gone as well so i do apologize it 's too riveting to leave you haven 't_''_461.64 got a rush into submission and for us maybe a that is correct no this is your your-your-your actually genuinely here is your last stitch it is my last hey supplying with the agenda my name is Jim Dabrowski and I 'm representing Canterbury baseball here today I appreciate yannis encouragement to speak in front of the council and ask that the council investigate ways we can support baseball in Christchurch as part of the amended annual plan baseball has grown from 600 to 6,000 in New Zealand over the last five years across Auckland rangga Wellington and Christchurch and Christchurch we 've gone from two teams of about 20 kids for years ago in 2012 to 12 teams this last year across four leagues encompassing 170 kids a very quick rate through open days and demonstration exhibits at events like the cultural festival and working with primary schools throughout Christchurch at an early age we anticipate that membership will more than double in 2016 we currently have only two proper baseball diamonds both located at Dave and head park that are in high demand for both practices and games and they require a significant maintenance and upkeep to keep them in a playable condition we need safe convenient fields for all kids to play we 're looking to expand possibly to the east we 've met with staff at qe2 to discuss options there who is very favorable and supporting the location now it 's just a matter of trying to work with the city to develop the plan and the funding for it we 're supported by New Zealand baseball and major league baseball Major League Baseball is provided camps and coaches to come to Christchurch and train children and folks of all ages for no cost they 've provided access to their maintence staff to give recommendations on how to keep up and maintain fields major league pitcher DJ Caruso will be here for a six-month assignment to help spread baseball throughout Christchurch Facebook is back to look local community in many ways we have significant exposure at the New Zealand wide and international level across Japan every two years there was five key bees that are selected to go over for free week-long training all all expenses paid their international tournaments such as the Cal Ripken tournament in the US this year where last year we had one player from Christchurch attend this year there are three players attending as well as other tournaments in Australia and other countries what we 're looking at the future is we 're seeing the rise in college scholarships for Kiwi players to go abroad as well as getting additional major league exposure and the number of Kiwis playing at that level professionally both in the u.s. and Japan and other countries around the world is is great we also knew we also understand that it 's going to be back in the Olympics in 2020 and I 'm sure New Zeeland will be key to have a New Zealand and we want to be a leader in its growth Canterbury baseball asked that the council investigate support for baseball and Christchurch we are eagerly working with council and park staff to gain a better understanding of the processes showcase and showcase baseball 's growth at all levels we look forward to working with the council during this exciting time thank you thank you very much and that I mean because you haven 't put in a Briton submission will make sure that that is included as part of the submission process and a response will be given as part of our deliberation great even very much Thank You Cathy Morris actually not Matt Matt Gerard come forward page me up to 80 run councils beard thank you very much for the opportunity to make the submission Justin passing we like to take the knowledge take this opportunity to acknowledge the reason for Pat recent parcel near Kerry who many will will be aware was a long time member of the Christchurch utage team and its previous incarnations as well as as expertise as an act if he design initiatives Historic Places can be also wish to acknowledge the professionalism and dedication of the crosier city council here at each team and asked that you pass on our appreciation of the endeavours in addition I realized is probably passes from governance to management we are aware and it is our perception and we have practice to somebody self-restraint because we aware that here his team is flat out and so in some cases we practice self restraint and dealing with because we realize they are with visible district plan Regent Street special price etc and we think we appropriate maybe to review their funding just to ensure they can maintain contact etc but we realized it really really busy and and they 've been cooperative and professional but they 're really busy and perhaps the funding should reflect that I 've been also briefly will skip through this one is that we should remind about listed number of buildings that the council 's been involved in a retention of a number of heritage buildings and the central city and further afield Scouty you 've got example today Duncan Theatre Royal the council alone and I think you 'll agree it 's a fantastic return for the mountain money that you have expended on those bottoms and in the contribution to the city and the filling will feel good of having back and we did point out that we think that and we be obliged to say this that sixty cents and a hundred dollars and twenty-eight cents a week is really a small amount consumed the bank on the package you get in return well later this we are and I 'm realize that particular this year we actually request that you actually poured more publicity in to the Heritage that you 're appearing this year I realize going to major PR component communications team we think you 're underselling yourself and the Heritage it 's a very commendable list of repairs and restoration you 're embarking on this year and the year after it would be great we 've got a chance to celebrate at the gate he is just one of those buildings committee is going to love in the back I realize I some council spaces the reason for the submissions are always straightforward as you may recall is a slight public disturbance over Victoria Square and one of the questions are writing of the deputation was had the space being assessed for its heritage or potential here its contribution Dolansky rakesh and urban design and I still haven 't had an answer on that and maybe there are some of the patches and council that aren 't lost those heritage park some of the spaces etc that might qualify or at their time were innovative and we 've missed out and they 've been offered accordingly so we ask I notice that on what 's classified as parks open spaces here to just move quite a bit to make sure we 've got that assessment just in case of something special we may mess that might be valuable we didn 't realize what Victoria Square I think it 's important question to ask and then maybe work done could be faithful to its original design next up we 've got a weave Gus acquires a letterman creme the square where designers passive spaces we know and there 's a proposal come from evolution what I we think the great spaces and then reflect the original out of the city at a jump in time to retain next up the canterbury museum capital grants taken from the long-term plan we understand that the capital grants commence for the kennedy museum redevelopment for this year and the following two years that she is granted six million two hundred and eighty six thousand dollars my apologies leave till 40 we we don 't submit that before the grants are released to the chem museum the proposed redevelopment should have been through a meaningful consultation which should be signed before the council but also like to remind the council that according to the Environment Court decision in cary museum trust board vs croatia City Council the museum is bound to consult with a parties to the decision including this Christchurch Civic trust so we asked before we release the release fundings that you 'd be aware and what the development plan has been fully consulted and been through the process exception one is a paper item the historic 't with the landmark fund no longer becoming available and this is a sort of just in case fund and that effectively as a paper and figure that may be required just in case but that amount set aside probably could be adjusted upwards so it may be used to say the here commercial building that may be at risk and the other one is I don 't think I can be accused of complimentary since i have no longer a working there but we 'd ask the old miscible chambers known at our city if it 's impossible to be advanced in its repair and restoration and remind that the counters that as it functions is our city it was a major community asset and i reminded the other day one of the embroidered groups and their existing in the suburbs there 's nowhere for them to exhibit in the central city exhibition for hall meetings etc that some institutions are available the museum subject to scheduling as well and there 's pressure on that as well as a space that 's available for the community re edits I bit yeah and it 's also pointed to part of the project and part pops of the over river anchor projects etc and we 'll bring people in central city so we just consider that and the only point I would make is we 've got us emotionally no plan process I will follow up on that one but the communication would be fair to say i had no idea what happened turning up to date and probably turned up I 've had a number of fun phone calls and time on the phone I couldn 't do care picture of how the process of something so I would ask that you would do it with you thank you very much it 's thank you thanks very much Brooke tundle representing crush it s three associations ej9 page 8 09 on your stomach good to go yep good afternoon madam mayor and councillors chief executive and council staff think this opportunity to speak to you today I 'm here representing their christ church st association not to be confused with the even if Curt history who do I trust the formation of the trust and it is an agglomeration of water sports user groups in resonance groups and it takes along with a little bit of help from the council so set thank you for that in particular so we 're talking about the proposed capital program detailed by activity chapter I 'll just um my apologies from mrs. sandra some the Secretary of the Association she was here but had to leave so on page 78 history each project we 've placed see fifty one thousand dollars set aside to begin the construction of a pathway from lynnwood paddocks to bridge street between the history edge and the wastewater treatment ponds we would like to see this project project fast track to provide a basic track to allow public access on foot rather than wait for years for a coastal pathway level of construction to be financially possible monitoring how well the path is used in its basic state would give the council an indication when or if to prioritize it prioritize and upgrade in the meantime thousands of walkins would have the pleasure of using it on page aways detention and treatment facilities and looks on page 84 the heathkit industry in coast storm water management program we look forward to the provision of detention basins as outlined in this project which hopefully will allow improvements in the hydrology and drainage on the Aven and heathcott rivers which are badly needed to improve water quality particularly for recreational uses both on the river and further down stream in the history it would lead to a win-win solution if the design of her attention storm water detention storm water basin and eastern suburbs red zone around horseshoe lake including the assistance in the drainage of the flockton basin Darlington area could be done in such a way as to be able to incorporate the layout of a flat water sports lake such as their envisioned by the East Lake trustees no time frame has been given how soon can residents expect to see results on that Lake proposal and how will the concept of a flat water sports lake integrate into the Avon still what a measurement Wayne no mentions be made of dredging the Avon to improve flow the bank edges are allowed to naturalize will thus reduce river flow and accumulate rubbish and does the naturalization of the avon river which seems to be the current state or direction of it imply will not imply that the east lake must be built to secure the future of wrong sports and canterbury where the history of achievements have been so strong page 85 the coastal pathway project we 're disappointed the completion of this project it will all be delayed but appreciate the progress that has already been achieved thanks to such a strong community involvement page 87 cob cottage we support a pair of cob cottage under the community facilities here a tad rebuild unit page 89 south near Brighton and boardwalk south near Brighton carpark driveway and tracks south near Brighton GT an earthquake appears we 're delighted to see these small cosmetic repairs being included in the annual plan but would like to see the council 's commitment to flood protection in replacing stop banks along the eroding history edge from South Brighton bridge to South Shore many local residents feel abandoned and unsafe due measurements in discussion are needed before at least short-term amount of engines to mitigate the erosion of the stock banks are in place this would give a breathing space while the longer-term history is master plan can be prepared in implemented and I have to mention the title barrier on which our association 's submitted and port of unfavorites further research end and I 'm sure I don 't know whether the mere didn 't read the correspondence that department asked us for or chose to contradict what it said in saying that the association and history trusts both both opposed the total barrier project exploration because we did not we support them I think I 've resolved that at the time and so no time for questions so thank you very much thinking I was going to ask the Ross Johnson some year sorry you start Nick this please oh great great I haven 't_''_1415.07 got any forms to give for you folks that 's all right time I 'm another one of those people that just pop longing but that 's what we wanted this is what we 're actually giving us exactly what we set the city crazy up for I didn 't realize that this was on and and until about three quarters on air before a meeting i said wow i 'm going good and read all you cancel as I 've seen you on the TV radio and you like you even more dr. maybe last time I saw you the end was a Brighton you 're a member of parliament at the time yeah and I came to see you about the road user charges that 's right that 's right remember there yes sir do you babe that 's why I 'm here there I do get myself on TV down again so and we 'll leave that you 're on an hour by the way really live stream right thank you well I 'm on the eastern side of Christchurch here and then the two or three little issues are like to sort of discuss who are your people and wonderful people and qe2 now I 've back onto qe2 with a lot of other members of the public there and the lent can be sold to the to the government for the schools when there was a young a clause apparently in the archive saying that this Lane was not to be sold because of the are that when the new brighton trotting club when they gave it to the council they could use it as a recreational park for the all the project but now i went to a meeting with the school headmasters in the government in Chile and they said that time as well the reason why we won 't pick that part of the park is because the ground is more solid than than the golf course with a golf course wats because it takes take too much to remedy and will cost and and also the this bestest saga I believe that the council must have come up with the I think the price of to remove the spaces to about 13 and 14 million dollars when I 've heard that private contractor to put a price in and was only half that and why do they want to sort of just leave it there think the berry and it could be cheaper to take it away to Kate ship it and dump it there that 's another little issue really it 's okay what do I say sorry I 'm still awake they 're also the freedom keeping a it seems to be a bit of a mess at the moment yeah I visited New Brighton quite often and I went down to the wind service and I I watched these freedom campus now Laden were pretty good most of them pretty good I literally went down there one day to say hello to the minute I tell them to put your rubbish way things like this but only saw a member of the general public go down there with a van I thought it has been and dump teen big black rubbish bags right where the recycling part was the freedom cameras didn 't do it it wasn 't merely general product they were they were Christchurch people so the gave that freedom came as a bad name on a temperature i 'm going to self-contained mode on just to be better to training a lot of these freedom camps that they buy an asset to the city they bringing hundreds and thousands of dollars in the new Brian that they went to service station the hotels and the bottle stores they didn 't drink that much and they went to the also the the pretty cool that then the supermarket no it 's ok now another thing is that done why does it take so long for the road works and the brighton area to be done half the time the workers aren 't there and the roads are blocked off it 's a very very confusing and also frustrating and also why are the buses the big buses even at and the weekends big trailing axle jobs no one end them thundering down the road i passed their houses the whole house shakes like a magnitude for earthquake and I woke up four o 'clock one morning and I heard there 's been a big buses going down the road and he 'd hit this bump and blew the windows out I 've got literally still got the frames and my the council want to take over the running of the transport system instead of E Keynes the great great well I k Wow good good thank you thank you I think he can bring me the other day and they said ask me about this they want me to write a submission on the email to say about how these buses were thundering down the road over the bumps and blowing the windows out this might be a good opportunity for the counter to hone in on this go wow let 's take it over here and look I have these other few little issues too but I 'm read out of time other people had to be heard and thank you so much for listening to me I remember red peg a week in red bags I would have probably come a little bit more tiny that but hey we 're only human thank you once again thank you very much it was a wonderful think it was wonderful just select clingy pr2 son I page 81 on your submissions what um Yura and as many of you might hate to understand so might think i do but i absolutely hate okay so the process for everybody is different and that 's maybe why some people are better one to one I 'm better one to one mmm ok and I 'm going to be quick rubbish how can you market our city clean and green with high littering and businesses allowed to leave rubbish bags on footpaths Pizza Pizza here if it 's Street has open cut tens and glass and begs on the footpath you walk down there voveran you 're in the morning when I start at six in the morning bevier in the afternoon okay and if somebody turn around fell over they would cut themselves but it 's not just there I seen in cathedral junction we 're trying to market our city residents have knee bends I can 't see why businesses can 't those little ones just so that it looks tight and clean they can put their buns out but begs no way Cathedral jump and yeah the consenting process for big projects as you know our work in the construction unfortunately in 1984 riots so the consenting process for big projects too long we 'll just jeopardize employment and training the next few months teams of construction workers will be leaving to work and wellington and auckland one of these guys have already been here three or four years you can I have a real big problem why would want why would anybody want to work in Christchurch that is really going to be how you market the city now the thing is they can get paid more and some of them can get treated better and wellington and auckland love them have families the second book building of the casual street all the guys all the steel everything came from Taranaki or windows have all been done by guys from Wellington so with syrup kind of um you know closing and then you guys getting into the next process plus the elections I lose my job in November my son lost his job last week dick Smith 's that 's the reality so people will not be on way and this is why we need collaboration everybody working together were aware ok the biggest problem I see is a closure and relocation of quake City 20 17 and the closure and repair of canterbury museum at a later date as you may be aware i 'm an event organizer seven hundred thousand visitors are expected this year what i noticed i went down senior Regent Street the other day talked to one of the owners because I 'm organizing my arctica festival he might go bankrupt so he 's moving out that 's the I don 't want to see that that 's really sad Biggers we need a permit system ballantyne spent a thousands of dollars on your fashion show 20 15 only to have a professional bigger temple on the red carpet I saw him go from the top end of harappan street I work sometimes four in the morning six in the morning I know that he did not sleep on that street he 's doing it now but he went up to hit from here but street or somewhere they come out with a beautiful carpet they had all done all the work and he angry when we used to do fundraising at angh you are a new world they had a book you had to go and get permission it didn 't cost money to be able to use that space it 's just a natural courtesy you know and really annoyed me because Valentine 's is one of my favorite shops and if they spend all that money why should somebody it 's like pushing themselves on them and I I just walk down the street coming down here I mean I know all those guys but some of them are actually they kind of makes you put your off wanting to go and do your shopping and intimidating and we need to sort that out and it doesn 't look good for it image I am organizing an art deco festival to 16 starting at the nova hotel in your region street i 'm now confirmed i 'll be doing it in november i 'm also doing a hidden history event hopefully with becca Heritage Week labor weekend and we 're going to put on the display of Cape valley glen kiss to run a part that thinks just that i have this i 'm getting near the end well note you are at the end because we 've had to agree that everyone sticks to the five minutes you know that we can hear everyone else before people have to leave well yeah okay but I 've got to say just because it wasn 't in my thing is I 'm pushing for and I 've already doing the planning for a new pool and bright and 31 man and a new cinema for Brighton 45 to 65 men and I 'm pushing for the team Mary its possession to come to Christ judicial nothing and thank you very much thank you just saw _"

    "text": "listen that has to get away for a very good reason as Tim Shanahan James cat gaskill and Adam and ash from the New Brighton Surf Life Saving Club and Paige 790 on your submission sheets welcome thank you Smith piece off to the game time as a CEO I better be there you can have a little bit yet unfortunately though I 've had to abandon support for New Zealand on this occasion better than repentance no it 's not the reason I 'm here I do want to say well we 're waiting for us to load that thank you for your support of today 's gaming and making their possible it 's fantastic for Christchurch fantastic for the stadium that 's sold out it is absolutely absolutely right all right the reason we 're here is to talk about new bride and surf lifesaving club and specifically the club rooms located on marine parade as identified in the submission the clubrooms experienced significant damage and the earthquake as is the case with a number of facilities out in a new brighton area and the club is now and replace those club rooms it has a desire to do that in the coming 12 months hence the submission of the day as part of the 2016-17 annual plan and an estimated cost of 2.5 million to 3 million dollars for that rebuilt the club has effectively just under one third of those funds in hand itself and it 's currently seeking support from external funding sources and specific to this request seeking 1 million dollars from Christchurch City Council to assist with the build of those new facilities I hand over James gaskill president of the club hello I hope you 'll all agree with me on how important the surf club is to the community and to the safety of New Brighton Beach guys with some stats from the last year we have over 2000 lifeguard hours seven people rescued 18 requiring first aid for searches over 1,300 preventative actions with nearly 4,000 people being directly affected by this it also does a lot of work teaching water safety to its own membership and making future lifeguards love your support it would take a lot of pressure the end will leave the community and christchurch with a bit of beach experience and you brighten a surf club that we can all be proud of the amendment to long-term plan identifies three million dollars for the regeneration of New Brighton the club certainly supports that amendment any funding that can go into new broadness is wonderful and something that everybody and you Bryden is in support of in terms of the request for 1 million dollars from the club there is a potential we would think that that money could come from that specific source depending on what else has been earmarked for that and if that 3 million dollars is already being used for other projects then we would like to think that a project like this would receive counsel support and funding could be identified from other areas of council revenue at the end of the day project reflects an opportunity for council to achieve something and be part of something that is going to happen in New Brighton there have been various false starts and you brighten this project is ready to commence and we in this project so it can have some runs on the board and demonstrate something is happening in New Brighton I think it 's also appropriate to reflect on the fact that the current club rooms while they are still serving a purpose I 'm not going to be able to do that forever at some point it 's not going to be sustainable to maintain those facilities in any shape and in the changing health and safety environment council as does the club needs to be very mindful of what are we providing in the way of beach patrol services to Christ church 's most popular beach and what is the responsibility of all of us to ensure that the facilities that the Beach Patrol staff operate out match the service that they are spected to deliver to the people that use that beach and the people that come to New Brighton to use that beach but while their use other services within the new brighton area thank you for your time and thank you to all of you for your service over the last three years it 's thank you I 'd like to acknowledge ref I helped him to take part in these conversations it 's a pity he 's not here but he 's been really helpful so he had a seminar that he had to go to the far right okay sorry about yeah I 'm aware to the vents and conversations with Rob Hall as this did you want to reflect that look we had a meeting yesterday involving ref and rob hall and steven clark from the milton christchurch and the i guess the overtone is there is a great deal of support for this project there is a great deal of interest in whether this project goes in the current location does it get relocated so it 's closer to the new hot pools is a whole lot of unknowns in terms of this but i think there is still a decision that can be made at this point in time boy by council saying yes we support this club we support the service that delivers and we want to ensure that there is money set aside within the annual plan to you see it a lot of promises but nothing actually delivered yet so this I think looks about the closest David obvious like I just like to compliment the triumvirate up there for their presentation today it certainly is covered all the bases and I certainly think that it is an opportunity that we can get some runs on the board and the eastern suburbs and thank you for your presentation very good thank you she 's Dave mechanic and thank you for the presentation I was just interested in you 've referred to Sumner obviously in your submissions and that was funded through the capital some of it was funded through the capital endowment fund that put aside post it earthquake so I know you 've identified a possible one source of funding but have you talked to staff about possible access to the capital endowment fund there 's being another one we 've had discussions with with various staff members I think at this point in time the the thoughts from staff will make sure that we get a submission through the annual plan process put it on discussed there was identification as I then as I mentioned of the new bride and regeneration fund if that is not soon as the appropriate source then I would we would be open through any discussions with anyone on going to identify other options I guess at the end of the day it 's finding three million dollars at most to build a facility whether it 's just facility or something different to get the right outcome from your broad Antonio because I had in regards to funding heavy approach central government obviously surf lifesaving New Zealand and life-saving is a kind of net as much a net national issue as a local issue I think I think the best way to answer that is there is a funding process has been identified and it 's about heading shouldn 't deadlines with various funders in terms of making sure that we maximize the opportunities so for instance router foundation first of June as their deadline for expressions of interest with regard to capital projects so we 'll make sure we 're engaging with them before the first of June we is an application on mid to late august so I guess it 's looking at the timeline and saying with God have come to counsel at this point in time because this is the time to be heard it 's great look thanks guys really appreciate it see you at the game tonight thank you um now we have James in sword James has got two submissions ones on page 74 one and the other is on page 37 for and of course with their own personal copies you don 't see Emma 's up oh yeah that 's the food business isn 't what which one would you like to start with the good news at all one piece Dallben okay it 's a seven given for one the mirror leann Carly new boots to particular deputy Emir Vicki and councillors it gives me great pleasure today to bring the solution to you and brent to your attention I was really concerned with the events that have happened over this last year especially in the public area where the owners of the dog we 're very young considerate and dog was out of control each time it did quite serious damage to my clothes into my body and I ring the council and I 've had no response or reply from that the second attack was the same and there was no response to that and the dog owner was the same owner and I found them very arrogant very unreasonable no collars no ID when asked for it and it was unable to find a vehicle to identify them the third time I was in the Littleton recreation ground I 'm actually looking at some of the equivalence there and it was a quite a small dog this time and it just grabbed altima lower leg and just took quite a bit of skin off it max Leigh I have to wrap it up to stop the blood from coming out I find this quite unsatisfactory and so I consider the council need to take some action and allow some funding to deal with this issue I think it 's very very serious I 've attached the article that was in the priests I think that supports my at the bank on the way in and the telethia asked me how the day was going and I said well I 'm actually going to submit to the council on dog bites and she said well she said I 've had a real issue this year it actually freaked me completely out her daughter Natalia Natalie got two bytes in this last year when on the side of her face and the other on her lip and she was aged 10 and this is in the merrier area and she was actually welcome to school with her and she just really didn 't know how to cope with it because there was nobody there to deal with the dog the school wouldn 't deal with it and the council doesn 't deal with and I think this is really quite serious of it so this supports my case so I don 't to say a lot a lot but I just think that someone 's clothes sheets is really bad I 've been a volunteer with white wicker or done for the last four years and I 've done lot of these issues as I go round the various houses helping people sort out the earthquake issues I don 't know whether my panel would like your support we don 't absolutely yeah just doing a second oh yeah I 'm afraid I don 't know too much about what the council has in place for sort of what the price is deserved for dealing with these issues I guess it is quite difficult when the owners or or dogs can 't_''_716.85 be identified the owners of the dogs but even are these sort of hotlines or help lines with people came to report these incidences even just making the public a bit more aware of what opportunities they do have to sort of report these instances look I 'm just going to use the live stream to do this because I think it 's a really important thing we 've got animal management offices rostered 24 hours a day neither one so it 's really important that you don 't wait till you get home and ring the council if you 've got a cell phone with you as well as an 03 number so that Oh 3 number is the council number Oh 39 41 a triple 9 I 'll just repeat that a 39 41 a triple nine and the o 800 number is 0 800 800 1690 800 800 169 now it will be classified as a priority one if there are a dog attacks or biting or dogs at large and rushing at people or a single dog you know so if you 're in that situation and sort of dogs rushing towards you I 'll get out the wafers but ring that ring the council say that you 've got a priority one and as I say animal management offices of roster 24 hours a day and Vicki 's going to put those numbers all over your facebook page and it 's don 't they and all dogs regardless of type have the potential to bite and a loose dog can be aggressive for a whole lot of reasons they may bite because they feel frightened or threatened or they 're injured or when they attempt to be dominant territorial and possessive so this and I really would encourage people to take action and as you know we 're reviewing some of our bylaws in this area at the moment and I can attest to the responsiveness yes that 's right yay thank you um I just entered in your submission you see rain accounts or no response so what happened when you actually bring the council well I actually am was unexpected and they 've been heaven or as I 'm just standing talking to somebody at the rain from the dog just turns straight under behind me let 's trade on Kamali so once I tried to get some information from the dog owner got nothing I rang that our 800 number cuz i already had the council number and lodged with them and i would have expected the council to come back to me with some sort of recommendation or what they were going to do or what was going to have it about because when you can identify the dog or the dog owner it makes it very difficult to do it but i did identify this site where those two occasions and third time i was just in the recreation ground i was inspecting some equipment and these dogs actually came up completely unexpected behind me and I didn 't actually see them coming sure I was just trying to understand because it 's it 's another case of not knowing what the council number rose it 's a case of when you 've rung the council yeah you 've had no follow-up no respect no nothing back to tell you what 's happened so yeah I mean I think that something we need to honestly think about yes so what also ago I was very disappointed you any answer what you 're saying we at the school when there 's mum took it out with a school and they didn 't want to deal with it and she attacked he contacted the council as well and was no follow up on it and you know the route that she was going to school and everything and I were at the council were followed up on that as well it said that you never got interviewed by an Aquino did they come and interview you know they had no correspondence nothing I 've never heard a weird correspondence is not something I 've never heard back they 've never rang me that never contact me and I gave my details I just wonder whether it raises um possibly having a secret like a urgent request number no no no its roster 24-7 Yanni and Rick it really is and I mean I just saw it now I 'm a point it might be worthwhile following up on the particular incident which was not fat that long ago was it not yeah i 'm just wondering whether it would be better to keep using the council generic number or whether there 's a separate direct Animal Control Number that people it does go and right through it 's a priority service so as soon as you 've got if you 've got a dog complaint you would have been put through to someone I 've been out with a dog control management team and they get the call on the radio and they go straight to the site it car this is an operation load up and find out why it didn 't it 's an operation winner day so yeah what there 's nothing we can do it earlier we follow it up to see why it wasn 't actually white shut it yeah that 's what I think we 'll do great tool follow that up but I don 't know but you can certainly expect in a situation like that that an animal management officer will be dispatched there 's a dangerous dog on the loose they will be despatched so this this is something not not heaven there yeah well I I mean I was the on the site for quite some time I to event and nothing happened nobody turned up nothing happened yeah okay all right so um can we move on to the other one you can do it you 'll grow a presentation for this one now I 'd like to thank you very much the end and counselors and Colleen and deputy Mia Vicki we actually met one to one with the counselors last Friday and we found that a we get liaised to the individuals and we can answer the questions and put our proposal case together today what we 're doing is moving from proposal case to the actual construction phase which is what we 're hoping to do oh this next summer season have an operational by October subject to the family I just want to highlight some of the bits on page two points has no suitable facilities for launching and retrieving business from wellington harbour under these conditions in the club facilities are particularly bad because you slide on to the waves and very often the days start off good and they end up not satisfactory youth sailing in the harbor and large groups very vulnerable in the vessels and also when these sort of conditions are changed it is a major concern in 2016 we have to no injuries and and this is just what we know bruising to a body in broken arm have occurred while climb to particular boat while being pushed onto the finger duty because on the public one the same as the club one you actually get slammed quite and the brief history that case the proposal facilities where a benefit of 5,000 25 people we did a survey of the christchurch ratepayers of the great across each community and for the fort recovery plan and we had total support for that there was no individuals that were opposed to what we 're proposing to do in two thousand storm and that destroyed nearly all ova Scylla tease there in 16 years since work has been commenced and to improve facilities we still have nothing to show and in 2013 we commissioned a report which to improve road safety at naval point and it was supported by them now here that community board is the ultimate who community would as an agent solution to a pro boat safety then next have i 'm going to hand over the rock who 's the consultant who stunned the flames and links and he 's going to give you a bit of a brief outline of the time thank you I guess we 've got here the concept plan for the magazine baywood sports facility at we 've got a lot of however there 's been no funding for this and the long-term plan the the cost of that was priced at about 4.2 million and that was provide protection to the harbor a safe environment for people to use what we are looking at placing out as the floating GT which we believe is a low-cost option which can be placed immediately and it 's gone provide protection to the slipway together a safe environment for four people launching and treating the roads so we tell you a bit about this this proposal of the floating GT the idea is to provide an immediate low cost improvement about safety in luton harbor so the GT has three components there 's a fixed timber excess GT a gang lay down to the floating GT and a floating GT which is constructed from sort of existing breakwater units that were recovered from the marina development plan in two thousand the estimated cost of the proposal is two hundred twenty thousand dollars which excludes private contributions of approximately a hundred thousand which have been already committed to the project and that is their supply project the floating GT will help reduce the wave heights adjacent to the boat ramp and reduce surge on the rain will easily can be easily exists from the water over the full tide range being positioned on the south side of the ramp the GT will allow vessels to approach into the wound under subtly conditions giving them greater control once alongside vessels can be guided onto a trailer by letting out lines from the GGN using the winter Doric the vessels onto the trailer the details vessels to be with on both sides which will greatly improve the efficiency of the boat ramp at peak usage and allow our recreational boat users to recover their vessels quickly and safely when conditions of hammer unsafe on the water so the boat safety stakeholders group have been involved in trying to get this project going they need total support from the Christ ships in Council from this project which has so far involved 200 hours of planning by mostly skilled professionals and others the project is designed to operate in almost all with conditions including south with sleazo North Wesley the Christchurch lyttelton harbour area are totally unusable so I 'm flicking over if we have a look at the plane of the breakwater unit it shows the concept being on that the south side of public duty which makes it easier to use an deadliest conditions it 's a floating GT which allows it to be used over the full tidal range the existing timber GT on the north side of the ramp at low tide that the deck heights quite high and makes it quite difficult for people to disembark from the vessel so the intent really is to have something that can be used in all weather conditions on all tied Rangers and allows boats in their crews to get off the water safely in these in these conditions you 're going to have it to speed up because we run out of time ok ok Pizza free contravene and you have been through this whole presentation yeah we 've seen a slightly later ok there 's a lot of differences in this and proposal be giving from what we had before yeah peps if we could James is a fight recently as he secured opportunities to use the dry dock for to reduce costs and cleaning the existing units and helping sort of construct that the new components onto them he 's got permission from stacks and elution quilt company are there three time slots available um July late July August in August October to use this dry dock to help with the construction also important to note is that this facility is outside of the the area that 's been designated as at risk of an overburden pressure incident at once and tank farm we realized that the quantity of risk assessment of this isn 't really Adam to August but preliminary information shows that rear side of this area there are few photos on Leah showing what this our facility will look like will be similar to our existing fury booth at the looms and Paul can link so that 's something that we 're we 're aiming to reap and now now on the next page we 've got the wee bit about this we 're just doing stage one of it which do the whole lot was a mention made and some of the characters will correspondents about we didn 't have a plan long-term plan we certainly have unless you are Leah in what Jesus wants to very quickly just meet you a cup of things here the the order the number one is the floating jeffy which should provide shelton but then the next proposal is number two which is the red breakwater and that will give prediction for a separate ramp number three and that will be very popular and I 've spoken to a number number of pinging owners and small boat owners and that gets the school boat owners out of the way of the bigger craft I mean they can be craft up to three or four ton being launched and you don 't want that with youngsters with optimists so that red breakwater would pick that artificial beach and then the next one is a breakwater number four which would allow the existing marina come back into action the parking area I presents a number of problems and I think it needs to be carefully don 't really fit they are not very good at all I have over the last three weeks last three Saturdays previous Saturdays and Sundays I 've gone down between 1200 hours 1300 it sees its out that way and I have counted the and recorded all the trailer numbers in the public slip and where possible I have spoken to the boat owners usually are about four people to a boat and often their family groups and they all support will support us in this proposal even a Northlander was there launching his boat of sad to say because Christ Church does not show up particularly well against the Auckland facilities but we are really well over time now and look there are a number of people who haven 't been here at all and the idea of this was to give people an opportunity that hadn 't taken one of the other opportunities to come and make up as a submission I member so I appreciate the fact that you 've highlighted the additional costings work that you 've done and I think that 's an appropriate thing that was available last Friday but they 're really this is the opportunity for those that haven 't presented in a different forums that we 've held over the last few weeks to to make their if their point honest veena so look I 'd like to draw this to a close so thank you very much appreciate you so sticky thank you very much I 've got a request from Stephan browning who 's got a plane to catch Stefano i noticed that yours is really just the purpose is to table a report on the glass aphasia is that right if you cannot just take you to speak to i 'll be quite rude please be brief yeah thank you Oh start right into it if that helps thank you that 's it yep thanks cute Cure tout how I am very pleased that to see the decision the council made to look at more than look at to phase out glyphosate based herbicide such as round up into ended put it into the annual plan for submissions I was interested enough to be actually watching your live that decision and I think you I could see that option to was probably the pragmatic be serving option and I look forward to the day but you might move to the other one and removing it all together as some jurisdictions internationally and the reason I say that is that having it out of areas that are open to the public it goes a long long way and and and I commend you for that but you do have a lot of area that is not open to the public but is still quite expensive and may pose a risk to the community and time if you keep this approach a glyphosate based approach I do understand the logistics in the difficulty in maybe finding alternatives at times one other point that I felt the staff report which I think was went a long way to showing alternatives needs to the staff need to consider some of the other options that are currently in use in Auckland for example and certainly internationally and that 's hot water and hot foam the hot flavors are it 's a product that obviously bubbles up the the water keeps her heat around the leaf of the plant your target plant for longer but appears to be as effective at all that 's not a systemic and herbicide it seems to be the most effective tool possible floor a lot of uses beyond that of course mechanical aging as the other one I 've given you three documents I did aim to do for and the fourth one would have been a two-page summary of the biggest document because then my role and no in your role it 's almost impossible to get through all the papers but I would suggest it you use that glyphosate no safe level as a reference it is online and we 've put it online on a website that i 'll make sure well in fact that 's it 's on the the next document at the top of it that is heavily referenced it 's been peer-reviewed it 's been gone through had critique EPA 's looked at it and others no one has come back and said any of those items such as glyphosate probably an endocrine disruptor his reproductive and infertility effects digestible pneus issues issues around antibiotics and nervous system effects and affecting organs also affecting colonizers like bees and the fact that the actual product used is much stronger than the glyphosate that has been used as the measure glyphosate just their principal ingredient and the herbicide you never use glyphosate straight you can 't get it basically and the roundup has end or other the 70 different glyphosate based herbicides in New Zealand have a range of other products and them edge events they call them stickers penetrators and other things that can be way way in our way more toxic particularly in combination so that 's all in that big document it 's all referenced and there was no kickback as to the actual science involved in that the other thing that I 've please me so much to see you go down this path is that the EPA that so many people refer back to and rely on for the decision making it is not using independent science in fact it is owned only and the last time it was science that was supplied to them by Dow AgroSciences who are applying at the time for one of the 70 different formulations that are out there before that it was 2004 was to pond before that was Monsanto who the patent holders of glyphosate at the time this document picks up on much of the research that is generally independent peer-reviewed and published so I support you very strongly in the direction you appear to be going thanks Stephanie one more minute would be very helpful oh you 75 okay um sorry one no no no I 'm sorry I brought you forward you said that you would be quick yes I am being I 've known even PowerPoint and give you a half an hour but and I won 't_''_2078.45 I just just tell you what the other documents are and I 'll leave it at that 's yeah what you want and the which I find us not the Beast paradigm shift is a discussion that I would ask you to read and it is the rationale for chemical free week controlled by councils and commercial operators pure a comb purely on the dollar sign so I noticed there was a counselor that disagreed with the stance last time and particularly asked that counselor who 's left the room I notice to have a look at that and you may come across it is absolutely imperative that we look beyond that I would also say that I think your costs will be less than then you anticipate in going to alternatives because if you look at some of these other alternatives they will be more effective than some of the ones that the council staff have suggested there 's another document the list of alternatives for councils and that may help and I 'm happy to come and speak to a particular committee that with a bit more depth if necessary but thank you and for your time and appreciate you 're going down the track that you appear to be going you can 't you very much thank you um I think they 'd like to pick up on that offer to nothing obviously there is a committee back yessum could be good as far as different tie _"

    "text": "first I 've been here for quite some time we could help them up here so Richard Peebles Brian Geddes Murray button and Stephen Mitchell was that right Stewart it 's my ice folk I should have put my glasses on that 's to be the writing with cheer I think you can sit bullshitter finish a wish you whatever thank you sinfully say 10 times less of a step we came up on the screen baby anyone say that okay just dim the lights up there for us he 'd be good every page down squad season huh thanks guys ready aura thank you very much for opportunity to speak today and after their grass mystery owners and basin with God presentation that would just like to understand get you counselors to understand obviously where we 've been and paths pause on the way that grasmere can be changed from its current wasteland environment to the reasoning to environment then it is surrounded by if we just to bring you up to speed with the location this this is the location of the site it 's 200 metres from the canterbury university it has parks schools amenity all the way around it I think we all know about built infrastructure around it proposed right on that bordering of shorts site there 's actually medium density proposed by counsel for the last review cycle way runs right past this gate bus route goes past its gate and the site is ready for developed you 've got people ready to to develop that it 's 1.5 kilometers to Miraval mall which there is no other large piece of land that close to the city to help regenerate christchurch that the history of the site we that there 's been a long process since 2008 when the submissions for pc one with put in and the it 's been it 's been in and out the commissioner and pc one agreed and stated that there is no other site that is more development ready than this site with infrastructure in line with council and regional councils plans to use the existing structure as opposed to building on greenfield sites as you 're looking through here the it was it was within pc1 we understand why there was the storm water issues and they 're the most way issues so both of those two issues now have been have been sorted too and then what happens obviously at got included in the lip Jerry took it out of the lip so it 's been quite a roller coaster ride for the owners for them the Grasmere area and as we 've gone through we 've been into a mediation and this year oh sorry the end of last year we went to the mediation and within the mediation counselor planners agree that it should be res owned we went through that a number of issues that the world that were perceived with the site they 've all been counteracted and and then we got to claims in it at that point as well because of our higher or the document the loop which now has been changed the loop has been made and decorative only so the loop map has been changed to be indicative only which means that there is the opportunity now that it can be a plan change being read a previously used to be if we go through to the next one so this is this is from the mediation that we had and within the mediation I 'm just trying to get this big if I can i push control wireless you 'll give two tricks go down the bottom to 12 worked exactly I and toe box really fun that didn 't figure was there was a screw ya cat it 's better go at least now I can see me if we could go to the view let me go to the view document of the view at the top and or next to the IGI XV no you 're just so down the hole and liquid screen no no no no no no what you need is to is to get rid of the screen a few up to the pick up to the top next to the X put it as a slideshow or is it and then just control- to get lots of PDA that 's not as media yeah i trow voice will bring it back in the screen control minus a got copies in front of us okay so you can go through anyway as long as you can understand so the mediation that we had with the council planners and the Commissioner we all parties agreed and principal the merits of rezoning the land the parties accepted that the loop and the RPS needed to change the the parties agreed that cream for Basin can be distinguished differently to other parcels of land around around the urban boundaries that aren 't included within that map and the parties recognized that that that subdivision is possible to to go so the actions from that mediation and it would be interesting to understand whether that has happened or not where the council 's we 're going to undertake the water monitoring modifier modeling to make sure the site could get water well enough and then obviously the the cat that council planners were presenting to you the counselors on the merits of getting it reads owned and to get money allocated for just coming financial year crusher City Council history with the site crusher City Council has submitted twice on various processes 've submitted twice for it to be rezoned the full section 32 report which is the costly report there 's been hundreds of thousands of dollars spent on this by council and further further reports were undertaken a start of the chef which concluded this site was development ready and and acknowledging that all the previous constraints that we would the site have now been fixed so what what needs to happen now is council nice elif cap funds to the site and stats and the great thing is the section 32 report has been done which is the costly path of of any rezoning of any land and it 's been done and it 's been paid for so the process from here from a monetary point of view should be relatively straightforward this this is quite a critical point this was back when pc1 pre-earthquake was the commissioner judged on this to be included within the urban limits and if you have if you have a read through this this is a it 's some sums the site up perfectly it would be quite wrong in our view that the cream for Basin become within the urban limits ironically when one takes into account the overall approach and greater christchurch taken by the regional city and district councils to the importance of Maxima maximizing and utilizing built infrastructure one could not average a clearer example than the site the the principle of consolidation to achieve efficiencies of built infrastructure has been relatively reputed repetitively and vigorously urged upon us and an overall context by regional and territorial authorities but came from cranford Basin appears to have been over locked so that was the commissioners decision at the time obviously there was there was issues it at the time why people are white council head and oppose that but they have all been now fixed I 'm worried that you 're going to run out of time so I mean there we go good boy absolutely nothing in here that anyone disagrees with ya the only issue is the weather you go down the room and the one thing I don 't know and be really helpful if I could understand as whether the regeneration planning process because it need to change the up years so as you rightly say the loop has become more facilitative in that regard than it was before so we were stuck between a rock and a hard place and that 's the only reason that it doesn 't proceed through the under pennant hearings path so and as you say we 've done all of the work it 's all set to go every reason that was standing in the way of it going under PC one in the first place has been removed so all the constraints have gone so it 's all good to go and we are totally on side with it but the RPS needs to change so the question is do we go down the route of working what they can to get the RPS change which is a costly exercise on top of the section 32 and I know that that 's part of it but there is a costly exercise to do there or does that does and this is a question does the hierarchy of documents allow us to do a regeneration plan and would that does not sit within the urban runoff because that 's the issue right now what we are asking for and the annual plan what we 're asking you for today is that the council shows that council takes the initiative and that you allocate a new in your 2016 17 annual plan work program the funding in the direction to staff to do a council initiated plan change the effort turns out that the council initiated plan change isn 't the best way or the most cost efficient way to resolve the issue and that the regeneration actors a better way we 're fine with that we just want to see the count so it 's not a question of that we actually don 't have the legal power right now to initiate a plan change until we don 't anyone until the replacement district plan is in place that 's step one all of them go through the under pendant hearings panel but it 's not a plan chat it 's not our plan that needs to change first that 's secondary to them we 're all with so it 's the first question as how do we get I mean we 've got it we 've got to get the rps changed yes so council staff have advised us that if they have it in the work program and they have that they have the funding and the time allocation and the work program that they can initiate an application to change the rps yes that 's right so so that 's what we want such take any work even currently with other parties to try and reduce gym clothes I personally you know would have liked to have seen the loop bring the Sun and it could 've and it 's just a shame that it didn 't but I don 't think that there 's any one round the table that disagrees with what you have the intention is and you 're defining the status of the lane in terms of its accessibility its infrastructure support the whole nine yards it 's a no-brainer but I guess the question we 've got is have we got a faster track option through the outline development process and the question I don 't know the answer to and we will find out as does that get us around the problem of the RPS and if it doesn 't we still have to initiate the change where they can if you look on that page MCC sees next step required yeah and which I 've just put up there now yeah and and obviously this is sort of a four pronged attack that we can have on this one is to lobby the minister to change the regional policy statement I don 't think that what 's going to happen you don 't know what he done well well he had the chance to do it yup but the lid yeah and and all he needed to do was make that that 's map within the regional policy statement or negative as well I know which is crazy yep they obviously leave a plan to counsel to lead through the plan change and and and also lobby regeneration and we 're working on plans on how we can actually deal with that as well yeah so we 're make the case to regeneration on why we need this and so that 's that 's effectively how I think there 's got to be we 've all got to work together yeah and not have this boundary I 'm sure with that without you know sort of calling for a vote because we 've already discussed this in detail in terms of the district plan review yearly quiz it 's clarification is it true though that we can 't was it correct that we can 't actually make any plan changes till 20 21 if it 's an our plan right our plan so what I 'm saying is it right past your energy you know the end of your sentence are without the agreement of the minister okay so it is perfectly and and look that there is no question that the squander no-brainer yeah it really is so if that 's deep can I just say I look I think we understand that and all the boys women have been very positive but it 's not just about accepting the acknowledging we want the scans will work in the central government bodies that we once again indirectly is there away in this this is a question that I understand that selwyn has worked through housing a cool process you know there 's other councils working through processes on different things is there a way that we can maybe be allocated a counselor to work with that we can actually have direct access to to work whether they can report back to the council on a par Ford council staff yes I think that 's very good we can give you a that the chief executive can provide you with a council staff member to work with but I think we 'll keep the process you know at that level and then but you are you hearing from everyone I mean where is caught between a rock and a hard place on the system as sure as you are we are absolutely committed to getting the change however which way is the best way to do it in the quickest way to diet and which is why i asked the question around the Greater Christchurch regeneration egg which we could leave it at that thank you very much for coming and presenting to us and thank you for such and as at a detailed turn interrupt me and just one probably one thing I 'd like to point out is that we 're talking about the cost of doing this plane change but you got those figures here the fact is you know that the lens ready for development infrastructure doesn 't need to be built so I think there 's something like if you get 2,000 homes you join up 20 30 36 million 36 million develop an appreciation xandret chen you write 24 25 million so it 's not a cost we 're talking about no no no no that there is there there is an amount we have to put on the budget in order to facilitate the change to the regional policy statement so and obviously we 're very patient about central city as well yeah richard and i doing my job as well and in getting more people within itself within this council as opposed to going to i 'm xl1 look you forty thousand homes no no no sense about 17,000 new homes being built when it 's a quote forty-four percent of them have been done by seven and one tracking their wives which is why I wouldn 't get too excited about freeing up the the regional policy statement and making it and decorative only because that will build more houses on the outskirts then it will in these and fill areas you know so i mean it it yeah you 've got to think about it and the whole of the situation so but in terms of the annual plan today yeah you know what we 're here for today we really like an assurance that we 're not going to give you an assurance here we are going to we 've heard your submission and you 've heard that there is support for getting there how we get there as as now up to the council to make the decision thank you thank you alright so could we um Pam you 've come back to make an individual submission and David and Victoria here as well I don together and still make I mean make your individual submissions but I just is there anyone else from a corolla that wanted to join the group David Epstein I believers as well don 't you Spencer hmm yeah okay right well I 've been given the opportunity to go first but just to remind you what I am today I 'm a sheep farm today so there we are I 've got my with me today rather than my head so do you have my submission do you have what I put through the earlier on and this is family in richardson about a significant dekhe logical site on our property what numbers are submission so what 's the time up there I don 't like the look of it hey Jay to the three hmm for the three hey jealousy five minutes each yeah well what right okay Oh double reading okay right well do you block my submission is crushed me hi Becca someone 's head over to central hey Jake I haven 't got it thanks in front of me but it 's about a significant dekhe 's been working through the district plan process I 'm not sure where councillors are where they 're aware that way around you are you have got obligations under the resource management actual identified significant decal I follicle sites on property we have one so I 'm asking for some funding to go towards this program to ensure that is completed they 're about 50 sites have been visited to date in this verse 17 hundred sites all together that will be logged air so it 's progressively moving through it I just wanted to show the yellow lines are the the areas around our significant viva la jewel sites on our property 13 kilometers of things lying around back at a cost of between 400 and 500 thousand dollars to fence our area and probably make our farm an economic and I 'm also asking for a contestable fund to assist with fencing of these areas as we are able to do them so it is a program that 's been it 's worth the district plan and asking that some funding be allocated that we 've been told allocated short which just seems of mere pittance so it is an obligation on the council to do it through the resource management deck section 5 or 6 or section 6 I think it might be of the edge or that nuked it no it 's not sorry it 's the wrong ones about 30 31 or 32 of the app that the counselors has to identify these areas so it 's quite clear in my submission what I 'm asking for I 'll leave it at that thank you any questions at Eleanor if pen you might just explain the specifics of that the big nickel ecological sites the it is also the regional policy statement that directs what has to be our child identified on our properties and it 's about the indigenous vegetation whether it 's good vegetation or not so it is based on Hugh Wilson 's work that was done a number of years ago that 's been revisited again and is the basis of this whole survey that 's going forward okay thanks so just so I 'm clear what 's the deadline for it yani the deadline for fencing oh no there 's no deadline on it but there is just pressure from other people to say right you should be fencing that and keeping your stock out of it b.pharm like this for for many years and the indigenous vegetation has continued to improve if you as a as the council or the community says hey look we want to see all these areas protected that remains removing stop we would have a pencil but at the moment we manage it as it is and fence off areas that we can do I start but so just so I 'm clear there 's no legal current legal requirement or deadline for use your fins no hero currently but what what you 're asking for is a process to have a contestable fund which you can anyone can apply force rice basis assistance to do yes yes yes great thank you very much thank you Victoria I 'd like to thank the elected representatives for their service over the past three years I know it 's not been an easy hole for you you 're light years ahead of previous councils but in my view the annual can 't plan process is fundamentally flawed this year in an effort to make the process more user-friendly the council is put to cart in front of the horse submitters who appear today will address the council without the option of presenting a PowerPoint presentation or at least that 's what I was told the previous bidder was allowed to give a PowerPoint presentation nor have x been allocated to be heard you will likely not have the actual submission before you which will make asking just asking questions more difficult in terms of making them meaningful Stanley who I behaved got the submission paid you 200 yeah ok well yeah I wasn 't aware of that um staff were quoted in the press is saying there they are working to offer a wider range of ways to engage with the plan process instead an effective barrier has been placed between rapiers and elected representatives I value my five minutes before the full council of the year the new process disadvantages both submitters and elected representatives like to know what weight the council will give to tweaks when considered against all research submissions and the major points of my submission as usual the cruise ship industry the port company should be encouraged to build the cruise ship terminal as soon as possible residents were told that Ackroyd be a temporary point of entry but now it seems to be permanent the port company should be a urge to build their facility as soon as possible especially with megaships of 6500 passengers on stream and I also think the worst they should be creased by twenty-five to fifty percent with a considerable amount of that money coming back to a Corot because we have to actually carry the weight in terms of infrastructure and costs of all those passengers and crew I 've also heard it said that that 's not possible Yanni attended our public session and he had requested that of staff to look into increasing were fees and he was told it was not possible so I have to really wonder who 's calling the shots here the revenue from war fees should hopefully think ham has probably addressed you on that point earlier today the small green rubbish bins were installed in two thousand and they 're no longer adequate in terms of coping with a number of visitors that we now have and I see Christchurch fund walkways and cycleways and yet a Corot has a serious problem with rubbish and we can 't seem to deal with it the other topic is the acro Museum and I 'd like to thank the council for carrying out the repair work on the museum but I think thanks are also due to the effort and good management of the director Linda Wallace the director should have been Frederick congratulated for securing five hundred thousand dollars of funding from the ministry of culture and heritage but to my knowledge no recognition or acknowledgement has ever been extended through unfortunately the effort and dedicated work of a museum staff remains largely unrecognized within the wider organizational structure rate the museum rarely receives a mention in contrast to numerous media releases articles ads interviews which give extensive coverage to the Christchurch art gallery and i support the communications teams great coverage of the facility but in comparison the museum in a pariah is a four and distant stepchild I hope the council understands and appreciates the important role the acro museum plays within the wider context akaroa banks peninsula and canterbury in addition to forming very very strong bonds and links to the enugu Runanga and night ahoo which is due largely to the dedication of the staff the council may not fully appreciate the fact that the acro museum underpins the local and regional economy which is based on tourism the council 's lack of funding to reinstall exhibitions leaves no option but for the museum to be open with its core gallery 's closed to the public for the foreseeable future the museum requires adequate funding as a core council resource and council facility that provides a fundamental service to residents and visitors as well as adding to community well-being it remains to be seen why the museum has not been funded to allow it to fully function to not install exhibitions in the museum 's newly renovated galleries is like having a library similar level of service as rapiers in the city I ask that you fund 250 thousand dollars to allow the museum to reinstall its collections and long-term exhibition freedom camping I know you had a long meeting on Thursday about that and I 'm pleased by the general discussion but again in my view providing free facilities paid for by ratepayers will only increase numbers and will directly compete with legitimate campgrounds and holiday parks there are several campgrounds near a gorilla including one owned by the council existing phila tea facility should be fully utilized as a rapier I do not want my rates used to find new facilities for non self contained freedom camping these individuals add very little to the local economy freedom camping will not be resolved at a local level a consistent nash national ID approach is required the existing by law is largely unenforceable due to the transient nature of freedom camping fines if imposed should be linked to the individuals driver 's license or passport acura 's narrow streets and limited parking presents a problem given a number of camper vans many of little room for other visitors and residents and I ask that you banned freedom camping and non self-contained vehicles on banks peninsula and that you provide funding for appropriate monitoring of parking and freedom camping as though my law is being reviewed and also I 'd like to speak on behalf of the Gaiety as a very very important community facility but the council has failed to recognize the value of community volunteers the Friends of the Gaiety has worked for nearly 20 years to restore maintained purchase equipment pretty facility and take care of it all funds raised have been redirected back into the betterment of the Gaiety saving the council tens of thousands of dollars the council has never acknowledged the significant contribution the acura community has made over the years the acura akaroa area school was not charged nine hundred dollars for the use of the gating four stars in their eyes a recent fundraiser for the school the same consideration should be extended to the Friends of the Gaiety and Friends of the Acura museum as nonprofit volunteer groups that raise money which is redirected back terms of applying policy with regard to nonprofit groups in closing the arranged marriage between banks peninsula in the city is now 10 years old but it appears that the council still has a lot to learn about the needs of its rural partner thank you thanks very much thank you could we reset the clock and at 10 minutes thanks David Cara Madame mayor and thank you very much to you and the council for hearing me today I 'm speaking on behalf of two organizations one is the Friends of Acura museum the second is Friends of the Gaiety today it seems I 'm everybody 's friend um if I may start with the submission from the Friends baka dawa museum the occurred or Museum currently has a funding shortfall as we 've heard of twenty-two hundred and fifty thousand dollars the building is now world-class having been extensively strengthened and improved since the earthquakes in 2010-11 for example with the addition of internal climate control but there is currently funding available for completing the rejuvenation of only two out of five galleries three additional galleries cannot be of the massive increase in local tourism from cruise ships in akaroa harbour as the historical and cultural center of Ecuador the museum is presently only offering one gallery for exhibition represents about ten percent of the floor space of ocular museum a second gallery will be committed indeed as currently being rejuvenated it started this month and when that 's completed that will represent a total of thirty percent of the museum space actually being used for showing the collections and all the other elements of the museum the courthouse the attend of 070 cottage and the Customs House are currently closed for refurbishment almost the entire museum collection is now in storage in fact out of twenty thousand objects in the museum collection currently there are two on show in the menzies exhibit which was opened recently accordingly the community and visitors are being denied access to banks peninsulas heritage having experienced significant opportunity costs and strengthening the building it seems senseless for the council not to finish the job particularly as the financial cost of doing so is relatively modest no funding has been forthcoming from the the Christchurch art gallery on behalf of farm I request the council to ensure that two hundred and fifty thousand dollars is made immediately available to enable completion of the rejuvenation of Ecuador museum as soon as possible the second point is about inappropriate management oversight of arka-dal museum part of the reason for the continued underfunding of the rejuvenation of our own Museum I don 't mean to do this but the next part of your submission is really a management i show that i 'd rather that the chief executive went away and dealt with it 's not something that governance can derive perhaps it would be possible to have a word with the chief executive after this meeting or you know in the next few days yep more than happy i mentioned it to him Ben thank you very much is may I then move would you like to ask questions about the akaroa museum now or shall I new hate it with hate from pain relief inventory I 'm surrounded by very good hearing the message okay good I 'll move to the Gaiety submission and some of the information given by Victoria and secondly I 'd like to apologize for not being Dale Thomas whose submission I re I can 't find it yeah well Thomas know and she sends her apologies for being unable to present this herself and she asked if I would do so so again thanks for the opportunity to speak I speak on behalf of the Friends of the Gaiety a community group of more than 50 members say when factoring in our khadora dale says at the turn of the century we completed a major refurbishment that brought the Gaiety back from a derelict and unused state to again being the vibrant center of community life in Ecuador the sole reason we the Friends of the Gaiety raised three hundred thousand dollars and spent three years of voluntary hours on the project was love love of the Gaiety and love of our community since then the Friends of the Gaiety have used the Gaiety to present numerous shows and functions for the community we have never paid for hire of the hall because all prophets have gone into further these items are outside the council scope like stage lights a sound system mirrors kitchen equipment stage extensions etc we hold working bees to paint and so do extra cleaning plant at the stream banks at the side of the theater etc we support the employed manager and keep the Gaiety alive and wealth because we would not want her any other way we are very grateful that Christchurch City Council has recently strengthened and repaired the Gaiety to reach near building codes but at the same time we are concerned that beside the strengthening the city council has created a very undesirable weakening of community involvement it is incomprehensible and indeed offensive that the Friends of the Gaiety are still being refused a key after requesting 15 times how can we look after her if we are locked out we are also being refused use of the Gaiety to raise funds for the upkeep of the Gaiety how can we keep up keep and improve her when the Christchurch City Council insist that funds raised raised be given to them as rent no council has treated us like this the Gaiety have been appreciated and seen as during valuable service to our Kirara we were recipients of a community service award from a previous council for our dedication to the Gaiety for quote a special and unique contribution unquote we 're all shocked we 're sitting here shocked well I 'm glad you 've got the written submission the current situation makes knows sense it needs to be recognized that we are not just people who hire the Gaiety but we actually are a valuable asset to the gate insulating tarakanov and indeed to the council so our gaiety is a cannoli ethering place and an ornament to the town there are counselors and indeed yourself who are here today who experienced the opening weekend that the Friends of the Gaiety put on last month and let me say thank you for coming to grace that event you must have felt the love and pride for the Garrity that we all hold so dear the friends are asking for three things today first that the council continues to employ a whole manager second that the Friends of the Gaiety the Gaiety continue to have free use of the Gaiety when raising funds for the maintenance of the Gaiety it is our hope that the City Council 's show the same understanding it showed in taking the decision to strengthen and repair the Gaiety you recognized that she is essential for community well-being the Friends of the Gaiety are a community group who ensure she continues to be alive and well on behalf of Dale Thomas thank you very much good look I 'll just hand over to Andrea because I suspect he may be out her face in life so the reaction that most of us around the table or probably all of us around the table have had to your submission this afternoon it was the experience I had less Saturday when I went to visit Dale Thomas and Friends of the Gaiety when I was in a Corral on another matter and since then there have been a number of conversations with staff so what 's outlined in the submission was indeed where this conversation started and I think the reaction that you 've seen this afternoon better in that spike um so the mess has been raised internally in particular the three issues that you have raised in the submission we need to take a far more collaborative approach and that 's understood we have an activity management plan that talks about community involvement in management of local facilities and you know clearly here I don 't think there was a full understanding of the amount of work that the Friends of the goethe and the wider community have put into this facility over a very long time and the way that that needs to be respected in a new arrangement where this will go is that we will have and I think there may already be a appointment in the the diary for a meeting between staff and the friends to work out what a MoU looks like between the friends and council which determines what council will do and what friends will do and essentially what collaborative partnership looks like in the context of the gating we need to make sure that we get the right answer to the three questions that you 've conversations with staff this we can put that processing train that we will get to the correct answer to what you 're asking for quite quickly and it 's not a bad because it was five seconds to go so thank you very much thank you very much very much I got here you 're quick with that apply to the Friends of the museum in terms of using the goethe to raise money to put back into the museum I don 't know it I mean it sounds like that there 's an MoU with the Friends of the gas he could could be extended to include the forensic literature on Rosie M as well thank you good morning shooting good point thank you very much thank you and thank you for coming all the way over thank you for hearing us all at the beginning of the year and _"

    "text": "and I 've got my hat head to bring a hat cookie I 've also brought with me the aircar mail which would actually be a McLain process the peasant it 's got about the reopening of the Gaiety it 's got about me integrated health center which I don 't talk in the annual plan process but it 's on its way and there are a lot of letters to the Arizona about the stage of the tournament so I 've never never up there 's an echo mail leave for you to all he 'll take breaks and I 've also brought the community development play I 'm sorry a community board plan which M if you notice reflex we were figure from the bottom of our and your plan submitted it affected us so I 've got something here for you too if you 'd like posted a but wait there 's more yes Russell Crowe alien pass out but I haven 't bought a picture or two and so I 'm control of this in control of this machine so that 's good look I want beside us banana banana peel in e-governance team we couldn 't do what we do without them and they were involved in our board on our board and your plan process as well and of assisted us in getting here today and organizing meetings with our community and things so it feels a bit like deja vu sitting here again today you know we 've been talking about the same issues year after year after year and if I go back to this is a paper that was prepared on the fifteenth December 2014 we talked about a well cared for environment maintaining and even improving standards for all contracts and echo I owari reward street cleaning rubbish collection general maintenance we talked about a well-managed roading network the importance of maintaining improving standards and then we talked about that the the slipway anecca rod needs some repairs rebuild some cemetery improvements in ayer pero yo cottage repairs facilities for cruise ship industry development of new walking trees now this was this was no 2014 and those same things are coming through today so a lot of what 's on us over the year over the the past 12 months communities have come come to talk Russell people in that individuals in our community have come to talk to us about it and then we had a very positive meeting where all of these sort of came to the table again so we we are aware that the city is and strife or and that the eastern suburbs are in real striving but we too are part of the rebuild and that we provide the the tourism opportunities in our town to support the city so we 're looking at a few processes around that that will help our town look much better in Jung provide that visitor experience that people will come back and spend a dollar or two and our town and also in the city itself right we 're am i right and the first one in the submission is the lower gallery of air crime now I 'm not going to go all through all the submission it 's quite clear what we 're asking for and things but this is one of the important ones as also for the tourists that come to our town to visit and the cruise ship passengers and things so we 've got a wonderful museum and thank you very much for all the the developments that have been done on it but the parts of it that are inching which are disappointing so if you go to the back page of our submission on page seven the pie chart there that gives you a bit of an idea of where things have come to for the repair of it you know I haven 't got my time in front of me so how do I know please go right so if you look at that there that that the pipe chart shows you where the funding came from thirty-five percent of that came from a central government ground which Linda our museum director found or applied for and we received and that basically gone towards the strengthening to sixty-seven percent of the building and a number of other things the long-term plan of committed fans that 's been in the long-term plan for quite some time the insurance was the museum if I asked ends for the facilities build infrastructure rebuild five percent came from that the long-term plan was repurposed 92,000 so that was has been taken away the funding around the museum has started buildings Liam the signage boards and other things around that and has been put towards the the opening of the museum the Friends of the museum have provided 24,000 from their own efforts fundraising and things and that the cadbury community trust right foundation thirty percent so there is a suit for shortfall of 250 thousand dollars and we are asking the council to consider this so that we have a well a well-presented museum both to our local tourists the tourists of Canterbury New Zealand and those tourists for overseas that are coming that is a 1 point 4 to 8 million dollar project and many of those exhibits inside the museum and hadn 't been done up for 25 years so it 's time something with steam timer look doesn 't it look great and we we 're very focused on rubbish in a garage and it 's um and I well Little River because they 've got the similar sort of rubbish ones here and we would like that included on it and the way there are they do their work because they contractors do their work as they actually drive by and have a look and see if the rubbish bin is full or if there 's some rubbish sitting out the top of that rubbish bin it 's not they 'll leave it and and we know that the rubbish bin maybe three-quarters full they can 't see it at the top and they 'll leave it as we 're going into a weekend so that we understand that hair that 's how the contractors has done I just drive by and see if the rubbish bin can be seen from the side of the road so we need to look at those levels of surface and this is not acceptable for a tourist a look at the size of that rubbish done that some it 's unreasonable mean X in the recreation ground opposite Presbyterian Church we 've got another one this is in the recreation ground and and and where we have our community board meetings and there 's all sorts of activity going out on that part and that playing field and we 've got this potty little rubbished him and it 's the full almost every day that 's it 's ridiculous and we need to be asking for some more funding to be assigned to that to looking at our rubbish bins and the style we use there are some in the town that look pretty pretty posh and we hardly ever well I don 't think I 've ever seen one over flying in the center of the town which are blue big blue drums the next one I want to talk about is little bit of a big ideas now this little little lung working group as of a subcommittee of the community board that applied for some funding last year without a clean 15,000 we have worked throughout the year we 've had a number of issues that we needed to work on including flooding the warrior river rating district was sort of part of this process as well and of experts have got citizen balance from Lincoln University genet reads an urban planner Mike O 'Donnell or communicate advisor from the community from Canterbury district health ball board we 've got John boils from Mariah reroute Runanga the community board and other community members so we sit sit around the table and we 're actually drawing up a little plan we 've got importantly a couple of council staff working with us too and that some we 're doing some amazing work with it so we 're just asking for a little bit of extra funding to allow us to do a few projects next year sixth one have a look can you see it 's like the sea this is the a wheaty tennis courts and little river and very important netball courts vital for sports activities in effect our school children now and our teams in the Serie H you have to travel to other areas because they do not have the courts here so you can see it 's a very poor condition and there 's also another set of courts in a Curragh that a that 's a vital that we had good exercise for our children they use this for skateboarding all sorts of things tennis and it 's um it 's considerable project that was affected by the floods and it needs that we need to do some work with us so there 's just another one of them the present condition with grass growing up between them up between the the area but it is a safe flat space for kids to Reich and ride and do all sorts of things edits in the domain so it 's not a very good looking site so but we do have a community that 's willing to work together and do things and this is a partnership that we had afterwards where they cleaned up and took the silt over and that this community is willing to fund and assist with with them with doing something that these courts so we 're asking for some assistance and to upgrade those courts plus the echo ones as well and that ever are ones of the very good flesh and one of the Fletcher series of work that 's been done this week and the improvements that have been achieved and moving forward to a DLNA for freedom camping issues it 's obviously quite appropriate that it 's come at a time when the government is also looking at providing some funds for small communities I 'm not quite sure that we 're small communities of the City Council but it would be nice to think that we were actually going to get something to help us along the way it 's a good the freedom camping by law and what we were evolved with with our community was a good example of how a community working together in a small community with a leader and amongst that community can come together with sound information present it to the board presented to the council and then we get an extremely good outcome so I do actually I do thank you for for that process and we look forward to being involved and perhaps some of us being involved with a working group as we go forward and enroute there 's a lot of things we could Pegasus board is looking at as asking for some dump sites and we also need to think about you know if we 've got new sewage systems going and we need to have dump sites with I 'm also beginning to suggest that we we need to look up tourism for a Curragh if the cruise ships are going to remain for some time and it looks as though it 's evident we need to do some better management of what 's going on it 's no longer temporary it 's all my tats permit and that 's what they say is temporary is always permanent but you know we need do need to look at something that 's that 's more sustainable things as we move forward the next one is across slipway it 's on page three of the submission I hope you 're following these through the submission I should be saying where they are on them on the pages but we 're on page three and about us as well this is like a worn-out record to it i 've been talking about this for a wrong area you can see there on the Left I can 't_''_694.44 put the I have got an arrow I don 't know where it is but on the left there long below those piles on me on that GT area there 's the end of the jetty so and they can as the end of the slipway sorry it 's the end of the slipway there 's concrete there so this is where the boats are expected to come in and out so they can only do that either side of the high tide two hours either side we r us a seaside town and we expect good facilities for our boaties to use and what we have it was dredged six years ago the channel was improved hasn 't been done sensors some issues around some silly digger drivers or some digger Dreiser 's didn 't deal with it appropriately and got stuck and there 's been all sorts of problems around there and people not prepared to take their diggers out but we are a seaside town and expect to see good facilities for our bodies and budget to do this but it hasn 't been it hasn 't been done so we 're asking it for it to be relooked at a number of these issues that I 'm bringing up now are also being suggested in the submission that come that 's been tabled from about 40 residents in fer so these these issues like the subways the freedom champions of Robert rubbish bins are all mentioned in it and that is well you were to think I would have written this but I haven 't totally independent and so there are other a couple of others that plays into town to there 's the bridge Bruce bridge slipway which is another one that needs to have a little bit of work done on it it 's down by the area where the school children and young use it for with their boating and sailing schools and things that it 's a very important part of our activities so if we now think a little bit more about tourism and the city I know the city is all about the rebuild but we understand that is also for the city and growth and sound business so the rebuild of Canterbury and Christchurch is dependent on a good tourism industry and we need to see that a Curragh has the right sort of infrastructure just the infrastructure that 's maintained and in a better condition than what we 've got now I 'm not we 're not asking at the stage for huge improvements but just been management of what we 've got now you know and there 's an example of the buses in a morning at some stage so a Curragh and the peninsula had crushes our older part of this tourism opportunity and we need to make sure that we 're actually looking after our tour as well it 's our shop window and we need to have our town and good order so that they will come back and visit us and provide them with a wonderful visitor experience so here 's another one of the tourist that 's what the streets are like you can see there 's no vehicles on the road but the people are walking down the footpath 's over perhaps over 200,000 plus visitors that are coming to our town local visitors in plus local visitors and day-trippers and it 's um we 're an easy place to reach so we have to be dealing with some of these tourists issues that are being presented to us too well this is rather they not a nice an embarrassment really this is you cottage one of the City Council 's little old cottages that it owns and it just indicates a general standard of maintenance and presentation of the town and it just lets us down we 've been grappling with us for a number of years a couple of years now it hasn 't come up with an alternative use we have asked for options on it but just seeing this like this in the middle of our town and tourists working past it 's very sad but there are the things that we see around the town as well you know we see this in the footpaths and in the gutters you know we understand that that no there 's contractors over there they should be putting in requests for service but it 's a dismal site that we 're seeing so how can it be allowed to stay like this so Justin and going to the the end of the submission here I just want to talk about and the process is being used look we had a wonderful process that worked very well for our community was the way the annual plan was done this year but I the Board finds it very challenging and it 's difficult to identify any projects that are associated with with banks peninsula and our board area it would be much easier if the plan was designed in a better way so that a Carrara came up with all the things on a corral that somebody could see what was going on we also put in a number of submissions in before Christmas to go into the the pre annual plan process they still apparently haven 't got to the table and so we would like to know what 's happening with that process when the community boards were allowed to put things forward for the annual plan that are in this annual plan do they go back to staff where do they go and what happens with them and then finally I makes you expecting a detailed response to some of my some of our issues that our borders brought up not a gineering decision I 'm asking for something official plan or individual responses to what we have said so we have enjoyed the opportunity of working together we want a vibrant community you want to focus on the rebuild and the growth of tourism and the good businesses and both Canterbury thanks furniture and a car and we we look forward to having your nature are some time thank you and Android it 's thank you very much thank you um thanks Pam for a detailed submission and certainly a very compelling verbal submission this morning complete with props which is good to say I just wanted to talk a little bit more about the a Kuro Museum situation yes are you able to tell us um how much of the a Kuro museum was currently open compared to the amount of the museum that applied and the amount of the collection which is available for public viewing at the moment compared to the amount of the collection that would be available for public viewing if the 250,000 were to be applied to this project and I appreciate you might not have specifics but maybe just to to to give something of an overview of what we 're actually talking about here compared to what 's going on at the moment look Andrew I can 't give you that there 's only a very small proportion of the museum open at the moment maybe it 's a third of the museum is open for it but to see twenty percent but yes very small yes but certainly the presentation this afternoon or one of the submitter sasakyan will be able to tell you a whole lot more I would hope about what is open yeah but it is rather a vacant space when you walk into it yeah and it 's fair to say that there 's significant frustration in the wider community that 's where the museum 's been left is nothing we 've that john menzies exhibition which is amazing and it 's beautifully presented but it 's just disappointing you go into one room then you look through the door and the rest of it 's closed yeah thank you if we turn to another part of the district the the hour ET reserved Little River the netball courts there yes do you believe I mean community board has had some interaction with the community in the community group there do you believe that there is genuine capacity and willingness in that community to partner with council to get a good result its most differently they 're enthusiastic they 're ready to go tomorrow to do something and there 's some amazing people in the community that could help them along the way to do it they are zuzia stood there are little river as an amazing community its vibrant exciting a lot of young people there are things are happening with the school and a lot of development at the school and yes I believe that the community good dirt they 're up for it that 's great thank you yeah about the road through devotion I think ends it because it NZTA or is it so you just make the comment that giving toddler because it 's a 70 k zone it 's within your certain councils maintenance our board has raised since in around in GTA maintenance yes so I was just we didn 't get that response I just curious with it we did that response come from and is absolutely correct the council maintains is ta roads through 70 k zone that 's what I 'm aware does it 's been a footpath that 's been discussed for some time it goes from the camping ground around to the cafe and and and devotions well used but the vehicles are traveling at Sydney kaizen our big trucks trailers buses and it just feels a very unsafe area so did staff give you any kind of reason why it 's not currently being maintained well it the path itself is being reasonably maintained there 's been some discussion about that that it 's not appropriate not too good enough to take a pushchair or someone on crutches along dividing line between the road and the footpath right so can our cells resourceful maintaining footpaths on NZT a bronze yes well over seventy days when it 's in respect we the open deep we can get thank you yeah I think it 'd be good me and I 've certainly appreciate the comment you motivate indicate a more detailed response back would be good they can ref and then Jamie yeah my phone just a quick question on the tourism stuff yes have you had any conversations with anyone the Tourism Board or whatever about getting central government funding for this kind of day no no and I haven 't got the capacity to do that at the moment where that comes from I mean I hope that the city has some sort of tourism management but you 're looking at to bring in these small communities that are having impact ensures no I don 't have an opportunity to talk well I haven 't taken an opportunity to talk to christchurch and canopy tourism or or anyone about it but certainly it is impacting our communities and we I might suggest it would be useful to get some data of the chain so that that conversation can be had yeah but I think that we should be leading their time in at some it is something that 's being picked up by the mayoral forum and in terms of raising the issues with the Prime Minister automate your arrows on the map yep conversation people think christchurch city and they don 't think so not just is so I mean we are crashing to the end banks pancha we 're one but the issues and thanks Blanche are exactly the same as that issues on some of the small district councils in you know Mackenzie country is all of those Queenstown various other places so yeah I 'll certainly I 've got a there 's been some correspondence between the Prime Minister and Dame Margaret so i might just feed back to her that we need to be explicit that crushes city isn 't justice yeah i wouldn 't want us to miss out because i think this research city and nor well we miss out on the government assistance for small communities and because we 're part of the biggest city yeah which wasn 't the reason for the shotgun meeting and Jamie thanks lien Thank You Pam I 'm on the rubber sure shoot yes a lot of the photos that you showed it was clearly visible to as household rubber I know that Terrace rubbish can we go do you want to go back to the may open in there so no time wise we don 't need to go back yeah but no they had a number of love foursquare bags and packing size air bags out of your car maybe they Sam 's light beam commercial rubbish I mean might be household rubbish but it says no household rubbish at us about ideally for tourists so I will be inept being cut to the chase foot so it 's not about enforcement of household rubbish so you don 't think it 's a household rubbish problem no i think it 's it 's a they making trips are the bananas aren 't big enough a naughty indeed Ricky they 're not big enough photographs yeah I think you showed up and be really helpful and there is one photograph I want to go back to that shows you the the big freedom camping vans in our town and the issues with the streets so I don 't know whether I did have been my finger on that one before not you can see the sea eyes of God the freedom camper their part longer side the recreation ground and the impacts that the big freedom campers are having on our roads in agoura they 're not appropriate doing that to the pelicans finally yeah it 's been negatively with us yes it is illegal hmm be surely the local cop it is that gives you know if you put signs up side my camper van zeeland it is an issue of the driver low intelligence is it is yes it 's Lisa but nips it needs an area where they can go on park during the day in school spirit it 's nothing no thank you very much payment appreciate you coming over the hill and and bringing the flavor of the fridge in the community boards mushrooms so I had to look at the other things that are in there the symmetries and yeah absolutely sorry more good reply thank you very much and will adjourn the meeting now until 11 p.m. plans and at that point we will come back for public is open might injure this lunch upstairs and the counselors now what are we having it

    "text": "this breakfast at lunch haha but everyone please take the seats okay guys was it everyone is everyone I 'm always she 's like a yellow brick just in the way alright tomorrow when the other night right all right thank you welcome I kenora everyone and the spreading his community board submission on the annual plane and mel and i are going to share responsibilities and for presenting it to you I just like to comment before I start that the process this year wasn 't as successful as last year in terms of getting the residents and last year we had two meetings one of 35 and one of 50 residents and both of them were reasonably stroppy and this time we managed to get only 12 and and one of the 12 actually asked me at the meeting of our submission on the annual root plants would reflect the comments that have been made at the meeting and I said yes world the extent that we also know what some residents outside of this meeting thinking there 's only 12 people here and first of all in opposition of sale of council assets and that has been spoken about at many a meeting and the meeting specifically to discuss the annual cameras no different and we have very few voices raised in support of selling our council as its at any meeting that we attend and it is a consistent refrain in our ward water I don 't think anything 's changed in the 30 years I 've lived in Canterbury in that water is the most important thing to cantab Rian 's they are very proud of their pure clean clear water everywhere it is and everywhere we are and I don 't think we could make a submission without commenting on water and I think I should speak louder on the topic I think that they should be telling the unelected he can and the partially elected weekend in the future that water is more valuable to its residents than the pure chemical whatever it contains it has a spiritual value to the people of Christchurch and Canterbury and we should be fighting for us in every way with that we care i also have broke will have even less wherewithal to be able to counter the Palouse the pollution and of the waterways around them and that the situation may well get worse this year and I think we should be addressing that too II came as well we have always supported disability access I 'm disappointed that many buildings and the rebuild and those that in particular that are three stories or less and will house fewer than 70 people do not have to have left just for example and I know Liam has mentioned before the fact that getting into a building is one thing being able to hear if you are deaf in terms of having loops and stalled is another and she 's quite right we shouldn 't always go on about access but it is a fact that have disabled people can get into a building they can then fight for the other things that give true disability access in that building and the factors there are a whole bunch of buildings in Christchurch in the rebuild that cannot provide services or employment to disabled people and that 's SN Lee in your plan for barrington plaque playground to increase its accessibility for children with disabilities and we 'd like to see more specific projects like that in the future finally in my introduction the board recognizes the significant loss of access to aquatic facilities for residents and these and subs the lynnwood swimming pool lies outside our borders but is a very important to people in Waltham 's and Martin 's and so on Oh power and they will be using it but secondly the principle of children in particular and families in general having access to water and aquatic facilities is very very important and notwithstanding the swimming pool is outside our border our Board believes that we should always be seeking to provide access to children in particular but all ages to water and swimming pools melon thank you um so with you 'll know that our board it puts the heat get river at the top priority we 've been supporting the mother or cleanups that happened last weekend we are concerned and residents are concerned about the mid Heathcott linear park master plan being still going into the river at times but in particular the annual plan has seat only 120,000 for the next ten years towards that plan which seems to us to not really be enough and we 'd rather that money is spent earlier rather than later so it 's front-loaded so that people can start seeing improvements to be made especially round flooding but of course around the beauty of it as well street renewals which have just been mentioned with some chili pepper nui grange street as i 've been told was at the top of the less than fevery 2011 and the residents of week 14 years to get it on to that point and to be renewed if you go down there straight you will see that it doesn 't look too good at all we would like that to be worked on and money put towards that Ward 's traitors and addington their street is quite wide and curves and as used as a racetrack by people trying to avoid going down cell when straighten other streets even last night I met a lady who had she was cycling on the other side that 's how people take that road so it needs them to be slowed down and worked on even a white lined in the middle road would actually be very helpful right tuning into sections which are obviously an issue all throughout the city any intersection you go through you will see people running red lights it doesn 't matter where we are because there are no right tuning arrows well you know in not as many as we would like but in particular and our ward as the right turning intersections on to Kashmir rodents in Taurus road coming from wheels wizz-wizz road heck film road tires pass road and people are just too scared to turn right so it needs to be looked at and something added to the plan for that and there 's also of course right turns onto halls we rolled as well are very difficult so obviously as traffic gets busier with developments outside of or hallsville area and other ones up the hill these will just get worse and worse so they really need to be meeting spaces in community facilities in general and spread and heath get lyrics been carried out by Community Development and visors we would like to see more spaces made available when I do realize that there 's work happening and with a specific staff member this I 'm actually mapping all those facilities across the city I believe but we would like I 'm some money put in to help support as well former children 's librarian 90 hoon hay road because it may me it would probably will need um large upgrades in the future as that becomes more used could I just say that the children 's library building was on the full sail list and Mel here litter box twelve hundred houses in hoon hay to say that this was a facility that was possibly going to not be available in the future and we received large numbers of expressions of interest in and from that Mel 's initiative has come a resident association that has now taken from guardianship of the children 's library at 19 who hey road and so we 've established a new well as a group looking at further uses as well as expressions of interest from a large number of other groups and using that facility hoon hay used to have a working men 's club there 's nothing now and this has been fortuitous that Mel put the energy in at the right time you 're going to mutual didn 't attend your meeting like you genoqs behind us as in support of a synonym cemetery and some feel Park landscape playing as well as the summer field and residents association so we would like provision for a plan to be made their power adult library which is something that Carolyn 's been supporting those volunteers who 've been waiting incredibly patiently to find out what 's happening we 've been informed that workers to happen on appearing yet but there 's no clear statement of that within the annual plan is no line that says of power adult library and we would like to see that so we can feel confident that we believe believe it not that we don 't trust off but it would be nice to other buildings in the community and the power at adults library in children 's library committee who have been so hard working on this issue very much want to see it identified in the annual plan as being done and be go be able to see it in the annual plan there was nowhere where they can see work being done on the adult library on this week color we were surprised to see proposals come out asking the community to discuss using non-poisonous methods in the suppression of weeds because this last spring I raised with staff including the contractors the issue of poisoning because there was poison everywhere this last spring including in parks where they would be run off into the rivers end at nappeun away I 'm just south south of the A&P show ground and the poison had access to the water our boards very much in support of this it was raised by a Residents Association and we support their raising of it and we very much support the proposal and we 'd like to see Farley 's poison than was apparent last spring of the memorial at Wilson Memorial gates and with these six thousand lived and this annual budget and we look forward to seeing the grass sewing and the plantings that will come from net 6,000 for the last two years we have laid a wreath at Walter Memorial great gates and have been joined by a dozen 15 residents who have read out the biographies provided by the librarians of men from Christchurch who went to the First World War and what happened to them one bloke had been downgraded from corporal to private 16 times so he must have been promoted 16 times too and he was downgraded 16 times and was close to being charged with desertion when he was finally wounded and sent home where he was safe and didn 't was not killed in the war but then he promptly fell off a footbridge so I 've got a feeling that in my had ingested a few of the nutritious substances that we all do from time to time home finally we oppose the lincoln road widening the widening of roads as a reaction to increase of Waltham historic suburb of all term in our ward and they are widening of lincoln road through addington has the potential to destroy Eddington we believe that the old founding suburbs surprised you should not be destroyed by widening of roads and increase traffic to allow people who live in the southern suburbs to the southwest of us to get to work in 15 minutes they should know if they live in those suburbs that they either take public transport or they bike or they expect to be in their vehicles for 40 minutes because we are not going to sacrifice the inner city suburbs to get them there quicker and that 's up thank you okay yes you know terms so Andrew gleam I 'm thinking I 'll just concentrate on one because I know it feels good a few things but just it 's a it 's a surprise I know yeah yeah I 'm going to be grew over Hydra I just really want to just emphasize the work that Melanie did for 90 hoon hay road and its absolute you can taste it what you and the biggest concern really I have as a difference of opinion between the staff here as in this building and the comments made to the staff and and the service center the community board and the counselors and this actually shows that when you have a building that 's Caroline to find Dutch scenic slightly back you a shot of Suzie oh that is the season to season but in all seriousness that is a real concern because we 've got a community it has felt so strongly about a building and not only the work you 've done I can 't emphasize how how amazing it is but that 's my biggest concern as zero there 's a disconnect that seems between some of the staff in this built-in isight some and our community board staff our community board and its counselors so I just want to is discovery some work done then I think thank you whether it 's so um thank you and tim has alluded to consumers both here but I just want to clarify it just to make sure um you I think Cara 's Library that previously there have been in terms of communicability the Baylor and discipline hey was the men 's club but that 's Neil closed is I 'm just checking your only do I have you know any other community facility in Hoonah hi so there there is the Downing Street change how much is true yeah yeah yeah but there 's no community facility of tools okay thank you that answers that and then the other thing was just going to ask you about it is around the letters get master thing it is to given that there 's a prioritization for flag navigation and it is it possible that what the board might want to focus on now around the plane might be to prioritize what actually happens along the river itself in writing that material to the scrub yeah for example including besides flood mitigation that would be a way to actually start cleaning up the river as well i 'm just wondering does it affect something they 've all and so deep of you to focus on we did a reasonably I 'm stringent discussion example where the board 's emphasis was on planting of the riverbanks to help flood prevention and to mitigate against the kinds of floods we had two years ago which destroyed the riverbanks and endangered and agent the river in terms of slippage if we don 't get on to those kinds of things quickly we 're going to be in another situation with climate change where though river banks are threatened again and it 's this has lost money this is absolutely lost money so we think that this should be our emphasis the trouble with 120 or thousand a year is that by the time we get to the end of the ten years it 's going to be with nothing and you know this was our major playing before the earthquakes I know and things do have to change but the river it 's health and its impact on our citizens was our major major work and we 've now down to 120 thousand a year which you barely it 's not anything that 's going to be able to redesign it or change it in terms 's really awful Andrew thank you I just want to focus a little bit more on the points raised around 90 hoon hay road so that property is currently closed obviously no I it 's the keys are available to certain people and it will become buck a ball and beginning in July won 't see all the details are sorted so staff have been very good with helping the lease arrangements around there which has been surprising to some people but as it will be opened it just doesn 't have full facilities there 's no kitchen facilities all those things as a very simple building that 's tiny it 's what every three square me so what 's required so the 40,000 that you 're talking about would be for a repair and upgrade of that facility we didn 't mention a dollar amount we 're just saying that we would like to sort of think about into the future if anything needs to be done and it will need to like catching that 's accessible and access into the building and into the toilet and all those because it will become that we hear this huge demand now it will be in there 's lots people that would like to actually have a bigger facility as well so it could be extended even you know because it 's got a large piece property at the back of it yeah so I mean there 's a lot of potential with it but it 's obviously going to require there is no amount of money as well so what capacity is there within the new residence group for potentially a fund matching arrangement for community management of the facility and for any upgrade to be essentially a partnership between that community group and the council maybe with some volunteer labor and fund matching through funds that the community group would be able to raise um I think well the committee 's get a bit 15 people on it which tells you something at the start I it 's hard to know how much money they could rise but I think that they would have the potential to do that there 's a lot of people that have talked about of things already that 's been discussed over the last six months people are really willing to chip in so I think things could be worked as a partnership definitely I just ya can 't put money terior figures on it ya know I Bay certainly this room I mean there 's even really open yet but I thank Quonset bells the momentum Moore and Chris right thank you Oh a good life is no one else just one other thing thank you just my question to you you Carol Ann over accessibility just the question is how much interaction is either disabled persons assembly will vary a free and your knowledge head with the independent hearings pennell process I honestly don 't know um I Realtors between yeah we had these arguments you know like I tried very hard to increase the exes to pioneer stadium the current car parking access to pioneer stadium for disabled people as a hundred meters in the open and people in people invent that coming bands and people in wheelchairs etc faced with 800 meters in the rain I tried to get the car parts yeah I tried to increase the access for disability in the in the back area where there were 15 carpet staff cutbacks and I had initial agreement from the management of the Pioneer but then money got in the way they would have had to change the door for and to make it disability accessible and it just basic cost too much and compliance was met even though the front door area where the life mark provisions were removed oh yeah yeah dear plan yeah yep and um these things these things worry me because as you know our board put a lot of work into disabled car parking we did mapping of the disabled camp axe we look at disabled bus stops etc and I 'm no expert here but the minimum standards are different from the standards that we should be looking to meet you know and but at the same time I do exceed that the council ain 't got a lot of money but I would like still to see the council put in place a process whereby the council doesn 't engage in build okay well you see that signal in our district plane it was explicit life mark provisions and it was yeah I remember yeah thank you very much it 's much appreciated and a lot of hard work is obviously gone insisted mushrooms we do appreciate it they _"

    "text": "back to invite um mike davidson from p.o.f to say i like all the support support civil yeah begging look I progress back on time um I won 't go for all error obviously the long-term plan changes that are in our walk because we obviously support them all as you can see and I 'll go straight to the additional projects that we 're looking at obviously your additional projects obviously means additional costs so that 's always a hard thing to weigh up and I guess when you 're looking at the pain yin if there are terminal guess what are the once our needs it and really the timing of some of these projects and what can be be pushed out you know you know just recently I guess in the media they 're talking about Victoria Street and what 's happening in there and this may be an example of a really good project and what 's going to be great for the city but as the timing right for that when we 've got other needs in the community that probably should be prioritized so board is looking at one of them is obviously with the northern arterial being built in the increase in vehicles and come in our way into st. Albans and the areas around it there 's going to be huge influx of traffic and congestion and so we need to start looking at how we can obviously reduce the impact one of the first things we 'd like to look at supporting would be traffic signals at the Springfield st. Albans road I think this is actually a really busy intersection at the moment as a t-intersection it 's completely congested at nighttime and we actually need to look at doing that quite urgently and then following that not so urgently but also at the edge where Springfield Road also just with the disciple waited obviously with the pep annoyed parallel that is coming that way the increase in vehicles that have gone down creme fraiche street we do have concerns about Kourtney 's street which is a small click the road there 's obviously going to have a very large increase in traffic we believe and it 's just not would be supportive urgency to upgrade the street to make it actually work we 're currently working on the community facility in st. Albans beside this the sites that the community facility is going to be situated there is actually a vacant section which I believe came to the council on tuesday we support purchasing this section of urgency it 's very important that we future-proof areas within the community that 's obviously used for community projects and this is a great challenge site we 're going to have a very very good community center in st. Albans but you know parking becomes an issue when you have a great sin to this obviously can take up to over a hundred people and currently in the plan there 's only car parks for about 18 cars off street there 's a chance there to obviously look at purchasing the sub the site for looking at car parking even potentially some type of a garden in there obviously at the moment of with the transitional center they 've actually got a very good edible garden so you know I think all attracts people to this community centers so there 's there 's an option there to try and keep a section for both parking and edible gardens I think we need to look at it seriously obviously one of the issues facing our Christ routes through all the wards is obviously the rivers and the condition of the rudders the sticks obviously runs drew 's chili pepper no award in this big issues with the sticks and one of the biggest issues of obviously the amount of the weeds and in this year to Center huge growth in the weeds and we believe that having the one week cutter is not enough for the the rivers we have and we would urge the second wave cutter be bought at a section of Belfast a Martian roads we 'd like this to be brought forward it 's actually very dangerous intersection obviously marshland rate is also increasing and volume of the more people moving out north so we would like to see this move into the next financial year installation of a disabled toilet at the corner of Horner street and pepper while back we 've got removed obvious reasons with the earthquakes we 'd like this to be reinstated there is no 24 access to a disabled toilet from belfast to the CBD so we think this is important thing to be put back into the plan and lastly also that the cranford basin this is obviously an area of farmland that 's not utilized it 's not a great look in area there 's the software that goes right by it and there 's a group of residents obviously looking to turn this into a residential area and I think it 's really important that the board supported principle what the the idea of obviously and filling us with residential homes and weird like a castle to seriously consider us to it and work with the residents regarding options for this land thank you can I just start with that one because um you stay on your submission that the council is charging residential rates but they can 't develop residential II at this moment this this was information taken from the submission from the residents in this nice area in the background behind there and I understand the reasons why they also be in charge residential rates because of the services yeah they get but I think when you look at this area I send the point of thing is when you look at this area and where it 's situated you know we need to look at some of the areas that just what is the use of them this is a perfect place we should be in fill in yeah no I I mean there 's nobody around the table that does agrees with it but the even limits of the urban development strategy and the RPS does not allow for it so we have to get we have to get that changed first so those people will make submissions yeah they 'll make some mushrooms yes after new themselves but I mean that 's the reality of it we can 't we can 't do it well in diverse then I guess it 's just making sure that councillors are aware that the community board supports the sovereign Talia where yep yep absolutely so appalling alley procedure submission and with the traffic signals and send Albans in Springfield and age we 're in Springfield par the rationale fled to as ensuring that the cycleway the puppy be parallel which is going to go north from each we rode up trafalgar street to courtney as a shared space and in order to that to be a sheared spaceless cycles and cars it has to be slow and to be slow we have to minimize the traffic volume so we wanted to two cars from going up there and which means we want the traffic to continue along each we wrote an intern right at Springfield now that 's a very very difficult right hand tune when its peak hour traffic so if we had traffic lights there it would really encourage the cars to actually take that route instead of cutting up trafalgar so it 's to me it 's a safety issue and i really thought that we were going to be able to get that through for this financial year it 's both of those intersections would be good but for me at least that the staff with the cycle web programmers that we install the cycleway and trial it and watch it for one year but i think instinctively the locals know that even now the lights are needed there so i think that 's a safety issue to protect the cycleway as well just before you move on because i 'm now I 'm interrupt again there 's also an issue with that as springfield road and to sin albans streets and anyone who travels down there time you know the four thirty five o 'clock time of night basically there is a tailback if you know the area from the Medical Center on the corner there of Springfield right down to Ken lock which is just before the dairy where that under section is so this is all connected as well so we can 't just suffer and see we 've actually got to be proactive otherwise it could turn to custom and in the other mention of the weed cutter that we we are working with the residents out there with our working group or the sticks vision group but also working party and it may not be the best solution it could also be a dredging option as well so we are looking at there and we 're getting a report back on costings and availability of weed cutters apparently they 're not so easy because you need a trained expertise to drive them they 're quite hard to come by the quite expensive and they 're quite expensive to move around but we are looking at their can I did to add to that obviously with the sticks find the biggest problems with the statics is the amount of salt and obviously dredging get through the silt and the weeds at the same time but obviously it is extra cost of dredging Deanna dearest we 've cut in but obviously it does a better job than just weight cutting but as you did come up and the ltp because I remember this was at the Stewart 's that came that the feeling was problem he end it seemed to me that we didn 't actually address that and the LTP and the the approach on this one is buying sort of equipment we contract out there work so I 'm glad to hear that you 've called for a report on it that seems to me to be the best way to go but I would like to see it fix this time because you know we I felt that perhaps we we had kind of not not actually dealt with that last time even though the individuals affected headaches again making versus apparently we have one weed cutter that actually does the circuit from heathkit Avon and sticks and this year we had a big extra bloom and the and the weeds and the sticks particularly which was an unusual one because of the climate and so they couldn 't get the weed cuttery up you quickly enough it 's out there now by the very the historically that we 're too and so the reason we 've got one is that one broke down so there 's a work being done in you might say yes yeah anyway the history will come out in the report I 'm shorten Ellie it 's been raised also around the instant all rooms primarily about the standard of the streets and I know this is something that 's been raised around the council table it was most concerning because some streets that were identified by members that covered in lichen cracked and very very poor condition end old deep dish are currently on the schedule to be repaired in 20 years time so there are a couple mentioned here but the board members are getting some photographs of streets around where they live as well and it is a real problem and sand Albans because of the age of the streets and and how long it is since they 've been repaired or upgraded so these ones mentioned here are just to really of many many and sand Albans that need attention before 20 years as you know sooner than 20 years and Phil um thanks Mike and just brief from the weed cutter you might one of the things to start tell us about the need for a second one or is that in fact often although there 's quite high regrowth when as a flood it 's the flood and so some of it may not be too sweet however that 'll be all count for in the report which was seeing and in overall yes what they seem to be moving around doesn 't seem to be that great an idea and might also just well it on the circle ways to think how what you 're here for the constructive approach you were you 'd be a token how to Rebecca of some very challenging and the shoes a limitation and so I think your request for that the traffic extra traffic light if Courtney the kirby street makes seats and I had I 'd also understood that that was in the funding at key it wasn 't surprised you can thank you for your active involvement Becky Annie thank you just three questions um hope you 're quite quick but um under grandpa basin you say work has been done but funding required but I wasn 't sure what the funding us animals so that that information that 's taken from the submission from like the residence okay so yeah the reason it reason it a mushroom right okay so we can get it clarified later um the toilet it 's the disabled toilets which is a great idea but have you thought about doing that in conjunction with the new bus interchange that we 're doing in Lublin because it would seem logical wouldn 't it to have the toilets with the bus interchange you know that makes logical sense i guess it 's making sure this 24-hour access ramp so yeah at the stage there is no disabled tallit 424 access from belfast to CBD so you are correct if it can be done in conjunction with the pus exchange it would think yeah but there yeah and there but there are 24 hour sorry not 24 hour there are they will toilet facilities available at northlands more your point is is that it 's not after hours yes if the bus interchange isn 't 24 hours it 's free net weight that 's like 24 hour yeah okay and then just the final question around the request to put the signal zone and you mentioned your fellow straight is it Rafael straight it is it closed off to traffic going north no Trafalgar streets going to be a slow slow streets they 'll be down to 30 k so the signals are at further along on st. Albans sprint zero driving along each we ride young and you have the option of going up to springfield road and turning right now your vision your building right that you can still go into trafalgar street that is going to be a slow street so we 're trying to obviously discourage cars from going down there because they 'll be shared with cyclists yes sir my question so in terms of you know rather than putting a expensive traffic on the corner as an interim have you thought about what the board support closing off the right-hand turn integer focus straight which would seem a more cost-effective know how it came through the submission process of the cycle way that the residents want their strength kit kept open because we were originally looking at double quarter second it but that came through a point in there were congestion on Springfield and if anything always is it will actually encourage people to go down to the end of the street because they 'll be able to get across at the moment obviously especially when you get a cycleway and the extra cars coming down there it 's just going to get very congested so we need to make sure they have an ability to get across without the risk we 'll wait a need for a long period of time but you 're recommending that the traffic signals go to each where Springfield no not repelled not revive it no no concern was that um they will be waiting for a year to wait and see what happens with the cycleway and all the traffic going through so in the interim before the signal comes in time but in the interim f actually doing something else like restricting the right-hand turn integer falga story no we 've had the consultation in the feedback as i know they don 't well set in the businessman were very very young probably about it but the thing is these two reasons is my exceed there 's the northern the safety for the cycleways and so the increased traffic in the safety so there 's to view and also the congestion at the moment warrants that anyway it 's a resident it lives around there the reason you 'd go down trofeo street is you can 't get on to springfield roller you can 't get it turn right at springfield on to st. Albans without waiting a long time put in traffic signals down there works you allow you to do that and we 'll stop encouraging you to go down trafalgar street especially when it goes down to a 30 k and you 've got to actually sit behind us a cyclist so you just need those other mechanisms in place to be able to encourage the cars to go the way we want them to go I clean with just one you know I know you ha loaded today Mike Springfield 's and Albans and in the past you talked about the northern arterial cramp would our cream for Dennis so do you feel you know the pinch is more going to be Springfield 's and of cranford streak goes ahead the increase in cars is going to have a huge impact in the whole of st. Albans and every street is going to have an increase in you know we need to make sure that we have a holistic approach to all traffic downstream of Anna 's road otherwise there 's going to be that much retro neon it 's not going to be funny hmm thank you very good all right well thank you very much thank you ma 'am now we 've got a morning tea break um could you just start a cleaner that 11 but at a fundraiser to take a little buddy say maybe port of an hour satisfied me yeah yeah did arrive okay right quarter take quarter of an hour yeah we 'll start again in five parts yep somebody has to gargle music _"

    "text": "Brooklyn book room all right all right it gives us great pleasure from Rickett and Wiggum to present the council with this mission on the annual clan and I won 't read about verbatim of just touch on viewpoints preauth wake of course the southwest area plan identified the southwest or the theory of Christ really a major growth area in the next 20 years but that 's been really compacted now post-earthquake and not only have we got a huge growth in area able to do also have the the annual influx in the Riccarton island area of Christchurch with them University students which is very very welcoming but does put a lot of pressure on accommodation and the inservice a-- 's in the and the racket and file an area of Christchurch and we have five key issues in Rickett and legroom and three of those issues we 've been addressing proactively through the district plan review and with some moderate success the first one being and the pressure arising from the intensification and the management of effects the second one that we submitted through the loop through climate change sea level rise and the impact on the headwater the headwaters and attachments and if they are a major waterways ie the heathcote in the navin reversible the other issue that we 've been very proactive with us submitting on the quarrying and the the proximity of querying activities to residential areas and in high high or gilbere thought school we 've got a proposed quarry that 's going to be within 60 metres of the school which seems absolutely bizarre and I a cart can 't leave this without mentioning the Oh word Oh wacker Holdings Limited which is a bit of a thorn in the side but anyway we 'll get onto that a bit later so we have been very has taken up quite a lot of our bulletin staff time as well but their submission through the district plan review but we 've got no regrets avarom have our efforts that we 've been putting into that the on page to the the third paragraph down are we refer to development contributions and over the years we 've seen development taking place and low-lying of christchurch is going out and buying additional land to actually provide for stormwater retention and detention systems and we believe that it shouldn 't be really the ratepayer of a verra Nui or hihi that 's paying for and the couch for paying to buy additional length the stormwater retention and D teaching it should the burden should be on the developer if the developer chooses to develop in and wet areas the developer then should provide the the storm water retention ND teach and systems as part of their development there shouldn 't be an extra burden on the on the right pair of Christ yet or on the City Council I mean so there 's two areas of land that are being purchased near over and them in in the halls will area significantly there are mirrors of Lane to compensate for the land that 's being lost with the development that 's going on in Henderson 's basin so it 's you know it is a fundamental issue that I believe that it needs to be looked at the other issue that i really want to that the board restates in their submission to the LTP last year the importance that have been shirring that the council has through this plan the capacity and resources allocated that high standards of monitoring and compliance of associated content conditions are in place and are capable of being maintained and this point was raised also by people when we had the the public meeting on the draft and your plan so the activities of some of the commercial operators in this ward continue to raise issues for local residents and communities the board 's role to advocate and represent these consents to the council in other agencies is ongoing and repetitive it is in this context that the Board continues to place heavy reliance on the expectation of the council having the necessary resources and the timely compliance and enforcement on monitoring film monitoring mechanisms and our submission then goes on to reinforce our our support for the the budgets and place for community facility South we 've seen de jambe community library and service center the record and community center and the relocation of the go cart from and the bullet points there and there 's a tu tu dia that I 've mentioned before there 's the Southwest SMP waterways d teacher treatment facilities in quase Road Murphy 's base and wetland over two to two instances of where the council is going out to boil end for stormwater retention and attention the we have concerns to about the monitoring of closed landfills and there 's a number of them a lot of them around their ward and we 're just concerned about the the risks involved in them the after care of landfills the issues that have been in the news recently about about behavior in in the Riccarton commercial hub area is something that we would like to see some some crime cameras in that location as of being proactive in trying to reduce and those incidents of from behavior and we 've got three three parks and record and that all blend into each other and it 's a that 's a very very nice area from change pressing through to Harrington Park and those those three parks actually flow through with each other is a need for toilets in that area so we 're just reinforcing that and there 's some figures there and it 's already been mentioned by other board submissions about the impact of of rates and the increases so does figures are there and i think i need to to dwell too much on that but just reinforcing that that that there is an issue and if we go to 2.3 point to capital capital release and we don 't what generally we don 't want the running of the city and finally on page five fees and charges and just really appreciate affect other community boards through their submissions and the problem more to come that we are really concerned and it it 's sort of the impact was when we had a look at the rate at the pool increases for the Templeton pool for example of seventy-five percent increase and and without going and because it 's already been said this morning and I totally aboard totally agree that we do need to have swimming pools affordable for the for the well-being and the health of was mentioned community service cards the other thing too is so there 's the ability to fight to buy a concession and card that 's that 's affordable this matter was raised by our community board in the past and then the counseling decided that they would have three month concessions and people having to pay for a six month minimum concession card and we were just saying that we want more flexibility with that so so that people do want to buy a concession card to keep the cost down they shouldn 't have to boy six months worth of it it could be because that 's quite unaffordable for people as well so I 'm very very happy to to answer any questions meta mirror and counselors thank you Yanni Jimmy oh I 've already had a go someone else can ever go yep things I 'm just quickly I 'm NJ I just trying to understand what 's happening with the cut Capri location- thing was that they had to have some certainty by februari 2016 otherwise the option laughs what the staff and I don 't no response required no I haven 't seen that rich bright okay so do you have any sense of where things are at with the cut cloth in terms of the agreements and now I guess if the timeline for Lincoln Center 's past and there 's funding on budget which possibly where 's the chief executive can help with that make yes I 'm not really in a VN cho you can answer the police of Education set for that thing to go yeah but I don 't want to take that Mike 's time by heading well I just wanted what it 's done is it has progressed I can send you that email that we sent out so I would hear residents association yesterday ok so I 'll just turn understand on the board point of view their submission is keep the money on budget put the money in a different financial year you should do a different deal what is what is it that idea but we can make a decision on here with real treatment of course I the boards of weird what 's going i think we 're gonna have a brief i went out yesterday as a result of the our tier Residents Association submission so yeah it 's great as well i tried three good Brett Brett and Jamie well one questions regarding to the Tula facility yes you 're particularly one Southwest alaysha Center the other ones the new home bid library services in here unit summation may be mentioned ideally in advance of divided state set out the charter plane if circumstances allow I just want to ask if you read our the consultation document on page 24 or so the annual plan most facilities contraction where we start in the second half of 2017 and the whole family until to open in 2019 but in the annual plan document these two facility will be opened in 2020 so here your personal donation ideally in advance which day can you talk to our fellow councillors what 's happened and we we appreciate that there was money in there we 're not we we are concerned more than a little really that that time frame has been put out that we hasn 't actually been confirmed or pinpointed yet but what we 're really wanting to happen is that that consultation and the identification of a site proceed as fast as possible so then and there 's indication through that from staff and through the through their plane at this stage that if that if their identification and consultation work has done sooner rather than later there is a possibility of that funding that the whole thing can be brought forward councillor chin so that 's really what we 're hoping for is that we can progress us fast enough to actually get those dates brought in closer but at this stage through the decisions of the draft and your plan that 's gone out unfortunately that funding was pushed out because it wasn 't it wasn 't it wasn 't firm enough to actually commit that funding for a particular year so that 's the bit of it we 've been on the tween a bit of a rock and a hard place we can 't go out of the lectern members and consult in fact we can 't even by this until the consultation with staff has taken place with those affected parties so you know we just wanting that to happen as soon as possible so that we can actually start really progressing this that we do appreciate the fact was that the money is in the budget even though it 's being pushed out but my understanding that there are the chance to actually pull that back in again yeah Kenji thank you and relating to the part of submission on the pool fees and charges yes you refer particularly to the pool of templeton are you advocating no increase or is there a level of increase that you that the board would be comfortable with we don 't believe there is a an increase it 's not our wish that 'd be an increase at all that be that the full charges be more affordable and I think if you read through the texts at the back that 's that 's where we were heading to to actually make it a lot more affordable and we quote the on the bottom there it refers to run that are virtually free and and should we have the philosophical discussion on whether swimming pools because of the health and well-being and the social well-being of health and fitness and relaxation and enjoyment should be more subsidized that are this so you 're looking for no increase on the pool challenges a potential time and presumably the second point that you make comparing the libraries is advocating you use that to support the reduction or the keeping the same of the charges of the swimming pools rather than advocating that we should be charging more for library service well now we 're not asking for more because the library services do a really really great job with the mental health and well-being of their community but swimming pools end and associated gyms more for the for the physical and social well-being of our community so we just need to have a discussion about that but we certainly don 't want to see increases and Paul charges oh thanks Mike I 'm just on the detention basins and their issues you 'll be aware that and pastes and program as that that area on the southwest of sparks road is for that purpose so when you 're referring to developers meeting the costs are you also you re referring to developers where the development is proposed that in fact that be part of the dcs yes okay yep yep thanks for verifying that part yet the other question I had meetings around your on page three in relation to the equip the fun provision campus is like that you 'll be aware might there isn 't usually a crime prevention in the sense of that did it get extra surveillance a isn 't usually the role of counsel normally be the role of the police or maybe the business operators themselves so what are you referring to say surveillance cameras around council facilities for example the bus the bus lounge I talked to council staff about them about them the cameras M I just forget the piece that 's to deal with it 's just a septet that sort of thing I 've also talked to the police about it the police referred said well we need to work with discussions that we 've got it to enter where um submission on the on the annual plane to identify that there may be some costs involved in installing cameras in the in the general area of the commercial part of riccarton and doesn 't set a new a new kind of area isn 't it what would the be potentially think from the local business association to also be involved in contributing to that kinda vision I would like to think that it could well be but I am aware that there is cameras around it was quite a lot of cameras around the CBD post Earth go for you earthquake and and and they are no longer there because they 're not that liberal Atlas level of activity in the CBD area so I believe that there is cameras around that could be relocated to record on yeah I think the police have been requested to address us so yes there 's a police responsibilities p.m. all of you as well of you but the police can 't_``_1149.739 do it on their own med amira no no we have to that around the security you 're right there is a company that is working quite closely with the police and the businesses and prostrate of property owners and through the rebuild yes because obviously with all on you you know walkways go through technisch roblox is going to be lots of places where activities could happen and now working with them to actually get the property owner to install cameras that SUV in kin to the police monitoring station so the same thing could apply to other areas yeah but it 's not the cameras unfortunately have been used traditionally to catch people after the fact you 're the modern technology that 's coming with the smart so the approach is being able to assess what 's going on in the community so picking up screaming picking up you know people gathering together so that sensing technology but if we will have available to us through the Smart City program that 's the sort of approach that I think is going to become I mean it doesn 't mean cameras aren 't part of the picture they are totally to capture you know images of people after the fact it 's actually also about all of the sensing technologies are being proactive rather than reusing cameras now so yeah no no it 's both yeah yeah yeah all right so thank you very much _"

    "text": "okk made good goodnight too much trouble inos me what 's it I just got me those Mike way i would encourage when yours cuz its nest or if you have welcome thank you very much um so everyone is focused on our priorities you 're probably we 're lots of smaller things we could have one batch this is the keys duffy really want to and the council to consider an internship and the lemon ball simple is obviously the largest capital program in the area and is something that well we 've had our first conversation with staff now about that the process that we 're going to it to go through we 're really consumed that the initial amount that 's been allocated for the planning phase is not enough and when you compare that to the twenty thousand dollars more that 's allocated for the planning and the first year for the Boston volunteer library rebuild it really doesn 't seem like enough to get that planning underway and we would really like a decent amount via funded for that for their planning and while we that 's not guaranteed and I forty-eight thousand dollars doing you know all the geotech and those kind of things that might be needed as part of a site selection process for external rather than to Nelvana see the 48 it 's currently at 48,000 for the planning for a very large facility so in the first year we 've waited a really really long time for this and it 's a really poor signal to the community that things will get underway when they can 't see that there 's a there 's a decent amount of planning summer skate park was well over a hundred thousand dollars in the planning planning and this book and there was tiny in 48,000 and first year I can 't see would be equitable with other facilities in there dear funding either a net planning phase so we would really like that funded at an appropriate level be really happy that the council have formally stated that the process goes really well and quickly that funding can be bought forward for the actual pool and the vote itself but I would like pathway is i guess it will be by the end of the year about half complete the sections that have been done so far are mostly fishermen tin enhancement but there 's a particular section that the council 's seem part of before in the ite committee of saying that is that is cool council business it is an area where footpath has been closed and taken away due to rock fall hazard the rock fall hazard can 't_''_184.5 be mitigated to a point where a footpath can be reinstated at is just too dangerous and the pedestrians are currently trapped between the road and a drop down to the sea there 's already been one accident in the area and we need the coastal pathway funding walk forward to ensure that that can start taking place around that area but also it 's cool council business in this area and we need more funding for the actual council footpath not the coastal pathway but the actual council footpath to be replaced in that area staff have said that this is a a reasonable thing to do and completely possible forward but also more funding in the new footpaths budget i know build pegasus were saying the same thing tho those footpaths and areas we 've put parts of either been taken away or being really badly damaged or areas where this for example a new school going and that doesn 't hit foot parts it 's cool council business to provide safe pedestrian access and and we would really like extra funding put on so that the particular section what can be done having the coast of pathway funding forward also allows the the community group who are currently fundraising to do more fundraising if council pushes out funding it really does limit the ability of the community group the coastal pathway group to do any fundraising because the funders the in saleable you don 't have any funding we can 't fund you at the moment because you wouldn 't get the work done and when councillor relying on the the volunteers to do this work and to do the funding for the rest of the code postal pathway project we really do need to be supporting them toilets and community center this project and was entranced to the community facilities in the long term plan and at one point hit four hundred thousand dollars taken offered to go on to the REDD+ library with no replacement of funding are looking at the what the community leaders this project was also originally only the replacement of the woolston volunteer library in toilets now that staff have recognized that the current community center is completely at the end of its life and completely not fit for purpose and deserve as it is looking like a combined project but was still only a small budget just for the replacement of volunteer library when we look at other facilities around the city for examples and Auburn 's in the amount of funding that those facilities get for community centers having 1.2 million dollars for a combined volunteer library and community center in a really deprived area as is not enough and we would like the funding to be increased on that particular project so that it can really meet the community outcomes and needs in there in that area there aren to have a community center built in the heart of the village with the volunteer library will really help in that community swimming pool charges we 're really concerned that some of all charges are set to increase eat again as they do almost every year and when I 've talked to people at something listen to pioneer recently they had no idea that the plan was to take them up by by new year dollar per listen child when you 're looking at ten lessons per term three children going along it really does add up over a year and also into the edge all entry fees for swimming as well the board submits that we would like to support the health and well-being of christchurch by either having and well to start with no increase in fees but also to investigate ways of making the pools more accessible for a youth and for our low-income that maybe by increasing our discount for community service card holders from 25 to 50 percent it could be doing something similar to Auckland where they have youth and Beckman Auckland they have we may not grow to 18 but and having having access to apples for a young people even primary edge children it 's really important and will encourage the appearance to take them and there to be more adult to charge some stuff in but the board 's very keen to see their heaven some of these and Thord were in agreement with the council 's proposal for the for the getting rid of the mostly the use of life glyphosate in our community accessible areas and in favor of the council 's proposal on that one the capital endowment fund would quite like a really clear process for funds to be accessible from the kettle endowment fund and in line with the bill Pegasus community board would like and increase in the funding for the water treatment plant to start controlling the midge problem that is growing every year at the moment auto stations while I noticed some worked heading in the background I 'm looking at what it is possible for cities to do in New Zealand we currently can 't either been single who use plastic bags _''_526.93 like they do in cities overseas such as San Francisco but we can try and incentivize people within the city to use their own refillable bottles this does several things so for a relatively low cost with council installing water stations not just drinking fountains but ones where you can actually refill your bottle what that does is it decreases the number of plaisted bottles that are bought by people that are thrown into generally rubbish bins rather than recycling creating a lot more waste and often ending up in our waterways as we saw with the back lean up last weekend and so actually saving council costs on recycling and waste and at the same time is allowing people to use refillable bottles drink more water and set of soft drinks better for health there 's new research out up north it took looks about it being much better for people 's dental health and things as well because people is there going to buy a drink is it she often cheaper to buy coke than the water that allowed people just the water some essential the only city there was one of the most deprived areas in the country and while we agree with the council 's consulted on priority to to concentrate on earthquake recovery in enforcing infrastructure and the east with is being specific earthquake damage we also remind council that they can 't forget equity issues and their areas that never had anything to start with can 't_''_626.06 be put to the side while we recover and while the area doesn 't have as much liquefaction doesn 't have as much council infrastructure damage as areas further east they had a lot of private damage and the the community are suffering there 's a growing despondency in the area and very little being done from the outside to to help with that they 're not an area that a good at advocating for themselves like areas further east are and so I think it behoves us as a council to be doing more for this area and really a suggesting in line with that how do I mashes submission that seventy five thousand dollars as it start be put towards council support of a community is currently a small master plan that focuses on the the actual village center itself but this needs to be broader than that and community lead the council support is the way to go on this one you don 't want a regeneration plan under the new we don 't know enough about what jeep regeneration plans will mean how long they will take but but to have a community lead process as I start I think would really help there 's nothing to stop a community leader OCS with a regeneration plan if we were able to the regeneration plan in the area and be really involved with that with the community but really really like that another model yeah top of what we already got with even going down the tracer yes anyway Gary listen we were with me we really clear that we want really good community of community development outcomes and it should be at the center of this they are depravation illegal ten throughout through throughout that area and we really need to look at how we help those who currently don 't have the has been run the last two years like the dollar pool and brighton and rather than having to the title many funders each year while while we work on the limo ballston pool we would really like council to just say listen this is important we need to get kids in this area swimming over summer they can 't_''_763.06 but the lynnwood area Jim really is the area of the city that has the lowest car ownership when you look at all the census data they don 't have the excess to travel to the beach to pioneer to jelly park and having that sculpt all accessible for a gold coin has been great the last two years in for council to support that for a small cost until the limo ballston Paul gets up and running we think this is incredibly valuable and we would like to counsel to do that the the old nursery site has been demolished there are probably issues it will be a hail site and but currently the and we 've been trying to ask this for companies the lynnwood league operation it will plane to it against each other and playing in an evening in the dark is currently all afternoon on the weekend there 's cars parked between the trees on them whatever new down the middle there there 's a huge lack of parking there 's been many close calls with pedestrians and cars crossing them would have to get to those car parks the build no siree site is adjacent to lynnwood park where they play league having a gate to put in and allowing access for car parking before than with league would solve a lot of problems in the short term and there 's currently forty thousand dollars set aside in a couple of years time to do some remediation work and would quite like that brought forward to help with making it an accessible car park poor League over the next few years until the site there 's a decision on what to do at that site and it would make a big difference to how the area is used enter pedestrian safety and also to our trees down that would even knew which looked brilliant but which won 't be doing their roots any good took to the city arborists mount fees and community center as a council you heard from them several weeks ago and made a grant mater mater alone and we 'd quite like that conversion into a grant at this point and I know that there was feedback from counselors that they should the mapping community center should ask that in the in your plan and we are supporting them and their and asking for that as well the last point here is on the electricity supply councils contract will be up in 2017 and we would like council in line let 's move and sustainability sustainability policies and move towards electric vehicles and to be fueling those vehicles in the other facilities and council with renewable energy currently council has a mix and being using power from non-renewable sources and we think that as a council and the we should be moving away from there into a fully renewable source and that 's how submission very good mmm I just want to stress couple of points and series two done a are happy to support it because we know the pressures are counselors under that we know that the funding set aside to get us through the planning stage is not anywhere near enough and we want to make sure that when the funding is available we can get the spades threaten the ground because it done all the work but it 's going to take more than forty nine thousand dollars and this coming year LC achieve that the other point is around the coastal pathway we have a commitment to actually return footpaths to our residents there is no footpath along pecan scholar area there 's no we 've got the coke look at the Littleton some of the corridor Brooks being done with NZTA we need to be working with those guys and reinstate footpaths where we can along this corridor that makes sense it 'll it 'll it 'll save money and on top of that that it makes sense to clip on at the same time the coastal path way it will save a lot of money so I just can 't stress enough that we 're working together we further from a lot of the various wards that this is an issue of our lining works so I just want to stress that point and lastly just on the Mount Pleasant Community Center they can 't afford this new log they are hoping that we will commit to turning it until grabbed through the annual to plan process I just want to stress it as well they 've taken onboard because they know they need to finish the works and they need to have that alone there to do that enables that to happen so they can complete their works but they will need that converted to what the ground Green Phil think you I 'm probably like a few of us reflecting on the tea party at all Martin the good work they do and just trying to work out you know what might be the best kind of developmental model have you got you know they do great things I do mostly I think they 've just taken on that they 're looking at taking on the local post office because the there the shops and then wood village disappeared in the quakes yeah under insured only one has been rebuilt and in the the guy who ran the post office he 's retired and no one else is going to take a non-certified a here are taking their own is a social enterprise and the board has helped with a small amount of funding but it 's a lot of work to do enter setup a social enterprise and to try and make that sort of thing work in though just getting desperate for for some support yeah just think of you know obviously have long-term developmental say actors that kind of it 's going to be a long time but in a way that 's rectus was resourcing the community organization so that they could sit at the table equal partner and the approach that we 've taken there is to you know put some additional resource like human capital people and to a person to run the actual community center when it opens so that that 's that 's a slightly different arrangement but the idea of community organization representative partner that speaks volumes for what you can achieve in a low decile area much more than just having a token representation or really the council doing stuff for people maybe we need to get some hits together over here and get models and up I 've made a note yeah okay so it 's a really good point I 'm Phil thanks you 're um crystal pathway yeah just like cleared over will you fundraiser a large amount of maybe until I 'm sure I my understanding yeah is that the project came about because that group wish the coastal path way should be there and they done but it was and that 's right initiated by their group okay that 's true so and now you 're asking you 're saying that the footpath should be aligned with their work yeah I mean at the moment the key priority is to get a safe pedestrian access from the tram stop and monks Bay around down past peacocks Keller and none of the areas that I understand the council footpath has been removed and that people are now walking go but council who has already voted and resolved to prioritize pedestrian access and safety in areas where port hills remediation we 've has gone on there you guys resolve that earlier this year late last year and what we want is budget to go with their to reinstate the council footpath it makes sense at the same time to have the coastal pathway work done in that section yeah because there 's no there 's also no simple way down there I know they dress the ite Committee on this and the counts it does add this stage the coastal pathway of fundraising to do the cycle way from theory meet bridge through to Sumner have you got have you has your board considered a difference and costs between for example extension of the pathway right through is against development of a the footpath through clearly what is technically very challenging a very chilling part if you would consider the difference in cost we know that there would be a difference in cost which is why we 've asked I mean they 're not religion is for what they foot paths in this area even though the council felt earth has been taken away if count there are there isn 't any we 've been told by staff there is no funding currently over for a footpath in the Syrian things so can I just ask you to about and like there 's begin comment about the work that took forever matter at doing that and you 've asked for support for them and that 's fine in the east part for lynnwood village it 's your board swelling as other ways that your board might all so support beam and I 'm asking it particularly because clearly that as a you know an area which is not going forward I we 'd like to support and the we 'd like to support the area and some ways you know but without funding in staff support it 's hard to know what the board can do so wonder though if there might be a similar community development kind of model which using at I thought what Toph are not our doing least the city that in fact the board block away it 's that same area that we 're so yes so the Sun peasant and then you feel support limo village yeah that 's right I see you just hidden defeat Olivia I see ya with the village I see the village has that master plan in that small bit but we need a slight brought up mate okay thank you now I know that that 's something the ite committees already asked for information on areas ways to support the village yes it 's just her hell the question really too though as hell how unfair it can come from the business people with support from the board as well yeah but um it 's not much fear I mean new feminine for a vibrant community having both small local independent businesses end and community groups around them as is really important is that you don 't become to the dormitory suburb and it 's the same and many other you know each where some there is all those once it 's a smaller local villages and this one 's really struggling and is many of them in the village a community development approach across that community will also support the businesses in that village because they 're needed in their area thank you all right um thank you very much thanks thank you thank you _"

    "text": "Rick Peterson why my bow the line well thank you for hearing my submission and it 's relatively brief we are very concerned that the rates will go up too much I 'm sure you all realize that every has that gets built like for like their the resonance rates go up a lot because their capital value has increased because it 's a new house computer melt has so there 's a lot of consumer fear of people have been rebuilt and have increased rates and increased by quite a lot and cable in the program we support the Earthquaker prepares to jay Park a jay Park car parking facility the bishop dos communities in center and library which is commencing this year the earthquake repair in renovation of Mandeville hat homestead in the bath house were very supportive of that and the mona vale gatehouse on-field ocean road we would like further advice on the long-term economic benefits of additionally upgrading this historic building so we could make it into a care facility for the local residents in the area we 've got some staff advise that this doing then you because it 's a beautiful beautiful room and building get morning we support the psycho ways endless paths we would like the connections of the cycle ways to be looked at at times because sometimes they haven 't dropped down the curb and channeling as they 've gone through with areas not on the lifecycle ways that small psychic ways and you mean you 're not not the not the one number major ones either smaller ones here we 've had a complaint about good side park where they haven 't cut down a coating journaling and have sacrificed to get in and in the connectivity between psycho ways and the schools has really good primito street one it 's not quite in our area but goes through boys hide that there 's working really well or will work really well and we support the school safely around our speed zones the additional projects we would like is the signalized intersection here would greens road we 've had a deputation about pedestrians and cyclists finding that intersection very very difficult and we really would like that lock a very difficult decision but it doesn 't have a crash has street and i think people were just avoiding it after having near gracious they just avoid the whole intersection and traffic 's a big fan in our area because of the move of people over into our area and the right tune arrows of heat and Glendoveer bottle and stroll intersection we would really like that under section look that we 've had many complaints about that and it 's very congested in the morning and is hard to get over there intersection from the strong area over into the fenders Ranieri it is very difficult and in general we 've opened though post stop shop and our service center which is working very well but we like some someone to look at the upgrading of the foyer with the cupboards and the staff because it is very popular and very busy and it is the face of the council for a lot of people and that really is my submission mr. good Rex did you want to follow up on the brakes issue because I know that of the quick question oh my no sorry I mean I 'm giving an allowance to the local MPs to ask throwing on the rest every night together sorry you 're right horrible race the local is the local councillors local representatives is what I mean I thought you might want to explore the whole question about a deferment of breaks and things like that for people that take that high capital value also recognized I mean I 've had this conversation with now but I 'm if you had I mean I 've had a lot of feedback from residents who are sitting on you know very high capital barely properties but us having to pay rates out of their pensions which are not increasing at the same rate as rates are so have you had any yourself in i 'll hit people commenting on that and when they get rebuild even if it 's like for like the capital value shoots out and then you get even more rights even on top of the the general rate increases did you like and briefs idea about sort of extending a it 's almost a deferment system as not until and basically released full rights equity release through right yeah it 's a citywide column that 's me but but your area must be significantly you stood there other Israeli what we want to go Kashmir would be another one yeah hi capital value and there will be more and more a lot of these families who are only in their thirties and forties are they know and they 've had their house rebuilt and they value suddenly gone to 1.2 million NOK we 've got a very low you from any single charge and so their rates are going it 's Roger it 's what Jamie did you want to follow up on any of these no I really pretty good there 's no need to overcomplicate caps trifle very brief yawning oh thank you thank you for the submission um just two questions one is um you 've obviously identified some intersections you 'd like us to look at those additional projects it 's obviously a challenge we have as making sure that we can afford to do could possibly the third order later or substituted so that you know I guess to use one that 's correct for example Victoria chase how many do you see that as a you know there 's something that possibly we should over there will be sent a future engineers first well we caught but the we 're not getting a lot of work done and now would for us to substitute and will be very tricky of ask aside don 't do Victoria straight to come into ounce Albert it 's not a lot more difficult from there so hip but have you got any I mean is even across the city projects that you look at I mean Victoria Street pilot goes into bas the sort of in the middle of what we have looked at the whole study but could be a possible yeah really thats can say other projects you come out of other cuz I think there 's much as we might line right no no I think it 's our drainage County we don 't have a we don 't have a lot of stories that he recovers money being spent on myself and it 's but it 's not Ian road and higley I 've got done our board was in solid service spread in history so it 's what it is actually oh it 's a fair question us so the other question was um just in regards to the rates rebates also the rights equity released are you aware of the government rates subsidy that they but Anand do you think people are sufficiently aware of that and are applying for it if you think that that 's something that you know on top of me buddy relate saddest just of somebody 's income as a lot of a certain level yes yes let 's buy some income so just two questions on it do you think people are aware of it and using it and do you think we should approach government to actually increase it and I think people aware of it but a lot of people giving quarters like Vicki said there are no thirties and forties their income is higher ever met right rebate area but they 're may have just more which absolutely everything they 've got into this new home that they they they now have some of the people on low incomes for example we have high capital value properties who can access that rates release do you think that we should be more actively encouraging it and do you think we should be approaching government they actually increased incontinently I think that is really well used but the rates have gone up tremendously on some of these new houses because if you have an old house the Distilled early fifties and you 've had it rebuilt like-for-like you 've now got a new house in a value is so much higher any other questions just one ok so Jimmy one question ok they got into the Malawi okay the house the commercial the upgrade the fecal 295 k where these people come from with our food star or starfish our net occasional internet yes it would be very nice to have that there were a few friends a little short of coffee element there isn 't one area it 's doing all the best a lot of tourists going through the bus stops that 's less than lease with stop those anyway so I couldn 't hear the lease on the main line of alabama state does it stop those state houses being used as can I don 't know its continued to caterers that are heavily aah over you and I don 't know whether they have the lease of the gatehouse because it was no they don 't know it 's just resident you it 's just resident is a very low value yes yeah I love the idea of a café Viet know which I it 's got an imaginary to continue so I 'm sure we could look at that Russell something but what wouldn 't have that much we could find that out from staff though that does apply as there 's ways to do anything because the other thing is worth noting though so we could actually recoup part of it because you know you talk of houses three hundred bucks a week or something you know there 's a fair rental but 300 AHL 's r square yeah slightly it could pay for itself before very long yes yes and it 's where the tourist buses stop it would be I think a very good idea to let the feet of the road each yes yeah that 's magnificent really and what a great opportunity there what leads yeah good for I mean it 's certainly I think there 's a lot of interest and investigating today further all right just not fully son thank you very much thank you _"

    "text": "all of the submissions but there are people that are on the pubchem Texas them it 's okay so that all of the submissions are from across the submissions that have been received able to be accessed on your ideas right ok so I 'll hand over to boo and Pegasus board Andrea if I 'd like you to introduce your submission and leave time for questions oh thank you thank you very much so theme is each year of the submissions subcommittee stop right outside and HDD chill Dakota thank you for giving us the opportunity to bring forward our submission you just like to bring to your attention that part of our submissions both long term plan and in your clean so you 'll see there 's a mix within the context see we also starting off with priority topics so into straight from three we have four main wave c four main parties that we want to be able to address and the first being the stop links under the long term clean as well although you can see that the council has approved an option for even River a road to beach boat or beach street is also the overarching master plan for V is to each and we like to ensure that itself Shores actually South Shore should have been added to that as well and that hasn 't been putting so we 'd like very weird at this so people 13.1 questions we had discussed South Shore should be a part of it as well and it hadn 't and we made it so we 'd like to see that end as well as part of it sorry just go in a little bit 43.4 would like to see removed you 're not going to be talking to that there 's one so 3.4 we don 't need to speak to them today we 're going to remove their performance mature all right after consultation further consultation with our community so you don 't want a dump station we do but that 's going to be under 3.2 cookies there 's another process going on at the moment he 's further down the closest you 're probably wrong so so is this is this keep the breath eating domain village there for a wee bit longer a lot part of it and also the fact that because of the self you brightened camping ground yeah there 's already work on going there yep we believe would be better more suited to use that area at the time because then it wouldn 't be any need to rebuild yesterday I mean I don 't want to catch up off the hook or anything or off guard or anything but would you feel comfortable with the refugee domain village did stay there for a bit long I mean we have some needs of our own I think as a city and it when when the requirement for the you know the temporary accommodation support is no longer there we would be interested and exploring that with the I mean what I 've justed like an indication to you and yeah obviously we would engage with the community were there we 've taught in we 're comfortable with their this one yeah it worked out really well as yesterdays it 's a good ACA the team Sonny 's another use for it well thank thank you very much sorry I know I won 't interrupt again try blades ok moving on to so I 'll go through the points than a few people ask questions 3.2 there this with a motor home dump station currently the nearest this is part of the effect that there 's really only one dump station for a whole of Christ use really it definitely from our side of town anyway and we 're talking about where motor homes are able to get rid of their refuge there 's actually no other area within the no other place within our area our ward that people can actually come to and so we 'd like to see that opened up so that we would urge the council to provide a public motor home dump station in the new brighton area of the avoid well south shore south near brighton South New Brighton on it with the campaign girl if that would be opened up because there 's not actually something there for any campus any motor campus yeah so we 'd like to stormwater outfalls that 's under the annual plan the current south shore storm water outlets are currently failing non-performing as you can see from the photos in front of you and there because they rely on back pressure it 's often not sufficient to open the valve silk builds up as you can see creates our operational issues I 'd like to hand over to Tim who may be able a bit more clarity on me okay as you can see by those photos you 've got there they don 't eat the water in but that only the water out either I think we 're having to go down after a bit of rain and put rocks in the open is to let the water out and it 's letting my job description to do that it 's I 've seen the actual flex themselves bulging the word came under there actually a totally wrong system for that area we have been told a pump station would have been better but we 've been given this and it 's causing flooding in some parts of the street just because I 've been to fulton hogan and manager out I 've had photos I 've had videos and still nothing 's changed I 'd like you to look at that please as I said the three points before we can we 're going to remove it so we don 't need to speak to it in 3.5 proceeds of qe2 park land sale to Ministry of Education so the board requested counsel to consider ring-fencing proceeds from the sale of a portion of qe2 to the Ministry of Education for further developments at qe2 part it 's something that 's been ongoing regards to community consultation with us as well other requests so that they basically our priorities what we see as our priorities various other requests under for they go through to from 4.1 through 24 points 17 some which I 'm sure that you 've been able to have a look at them are we looking at piping of snails drain the new brighton pull project and it is an annual plan Community Safety Partnership under the onion plan Kiwi card again looking at the effect that the additional provision of an additional 35 to 50 metre port I 'm sure you hear this me they 're just like to put that forward something to get the community keep coming back to us and there 's a voice for the community we believe we still ft voice why white Oh kitty squealing Ling scape plan another one where they residents have had funding available and they want to see it developed funding to be available to complete and implement the landscape plan and it 's under the annual plan development of land adjacent to runs library and I believe that that 's something that 's ongoing at the moment we just have to wait and see what we were able to go with it so that 's something that the community and part ones are very passionate about and that means that they are able to put their flavor to it as well coastal promenade thank you for your ongoing support there what would like to see if necessary finance to be allocated to enable a new brighton two-way mighty beach coastal foreign art project is to proceed funding to be allocated for addition of a toilet block within the annual plan for bottle lake forest information center full point 10 the ocean outfall pipe replay under the annual plan where has previously been advised that the repair program was in place so we 'd like to Chris consideration of funding for the ocean health field pipe appear to be allocated for point 11 we 're talking about traffic management around schools and show you all aware that we have a lot of new schools coming up with in our area and so we looking at future proofing how it works at the moment and implementing strong trovati management plans if the student stormwater four point 12 stormwater kevin channeling see that replaced or repaired we 're needed within the room parade as well as bail if we are they have been problems whereby we have seems to be the roading it has been said that it 's going to be fixed or sorry the channeling curving and is shipped to to be resolved so we want to see that going forward so in 4.1 for wastewater I 'd like to see some funding going forward for that in regards to extra financial assistant to reduce the Mitch population 4.15 bridge street landscaping funds be allocated to ensure enable a landscaping plan to be prepared and implemented we also here to support the 4.16 you brighten a surf lifesaving club under the long-term plan support of any funding requests to assist with the proposed new club rooms and then 4.17 adopts outlaw gymnasium we would park south under the long-term plan where the balance and community college trust we 've granted 30,000 from the capital endowment funding and we 're just looking to where 'd that area can be identified and lived upon thank you thank you I just like to I guess highlight the my usual pet peeves around the footpaths and the roading that 's just something that 's still not quite not right and our ward there 's still a lot of I think partly is scheduled winding out on the council minding and there is some overlap issues awesome there 's going to be the scent eating problems but there 's a lot of to be having straight meetings organizing being organized all over the place where they 're getting very very pitched meal piecemeal just dodged repairs in these are some of the worst damage streets in Christchurch and those quite a sense of feeling that you know they 've done all the good streets first and now we 're just getting the like that run out of money and so I think there 's there 's a real need to continue to make the the roads and the footpaths and the Easter priority we still got some very very unsafe roads and footpaths for for users oh yeah that 's my little push happy to take questions on yeah Tim did you want to say anything anything I 'll just say that say here pretty button since you 're here oh you thank you very much i 'll hop on again about the yeast free edges on our side still nothing 's been done we have been put in but it 's actually a joke to be truthful but gets through it everywhere we had some high tides recently that came in they fixed it by adding more grass seed this is the kind of service we 're getting at the moment South Broad Oak Lane us not the red zone is all the way through it 's not making the reference tool very comfortable the area is coming ahead the actual green edge which is now Medusa the X red zone is very popular for walking on everybody 's really enjoying it it could be made into one of the great things in Christchurch looking up at South frightened but nothing 's happening and it 's not very reassuring for residents when winter 's coming I tied suddenly storms so look I owed you again to come down have a look come and talk to us and please do something about it I haven 't been down and i have here to look and I do understand the problem but it 's residential red zone so we do need to work collaboratively with central government there still is a paper road in the front yes I understand that and isn 't that is a discussion point that we 've had with side of residential red zone the bay the biggest problem we have if we flood the damage is already done and we have I mean we 're actually more at risk now than we were before the earthquakes yeah and other areas of ahead Matt he spent on them and we don 't feel like we have had any as I say I wish that we 'd had a very loopy conversation about splitting the coastal hazards chapter between the coastline and the ester e side and proceeded with the ester side again I do say that if it linked up to South broken and your other cycleways it 's one of the beauties of the history I mean a little evening sun very very popular with walkers but it 's actually a disaster the moment there is another option I guess that 's just sitting in the back of my mind which is that we now have a new organization called regenerate Christchurch and the red zone component is not the only component that requires some consideration and I wonder whether we should be actually going to the stick the right down to write down to beyond bridge street so that we 've got that whole ste site and a regeneration frame of mind and I think that that would resolve a number of the issues that are challenged there and and obviously that would include potentially master planning some of the you know the South new brush motor came from there 's just so much as you say it 's an asset and when you think of the god what 's coming in and leaving you can think of the tourism component of it has just got so much going for it as an area but a proper master planned approach run outline regeneration plan I think early and the piece would be a a way of taking things forward in that area yeah I used you to follow that up of you would please because I and the community would love to know about that and working together with whatever plane comes out oh it 's it 's not a snob is the group but but what is us that but I think that in terms of you know the coastal hazards side of things as as as being dealt with in a different time frame and this that the regeneration planning process under the new legislation actually takes us into the space straightaway so close i think we probably need to recognize the there are issues outside the red zone that we could be that 's what I 'm saying it goes beyond the red zone yeah yeah yeah so um well I 've got I 've got clean David did you want a uh yeah I guess a Glen David Tim Phil okay I 'm calling it wasn 't me it was poor name that I think is a bit of anxiety around this because planes take time so there is a master plan process already underway if it actually works are urgently needed and I know that protection works can be undertaken you know while that master plans being developed because by the time the master planner original plan is developed it a beer a longer time and that that edge will continue to deteriorate so I really would like a push on we separate piece of words below the registry it 's not you know stop being it 's it 's an erosion zone but it really is Priya gence have we here yeah I mean what the community boards saying is that there needs to be some temporary protection at the same time as the master planning process really never yeah well I mean it 's not masturbating it 's regeneration planning it 's a different concept well if I could say something if any of the counselors would like to get in touch with me I can give them a guided tour anytime they like and show them some of the problems yeah yeah we could fix it I don 't know doing that some it 's good you know picture paints a thousand words yeah Todd faster setup I mean in the other side of it is that it is beautiful as well oh it 's stunning i mean the summary photograph taken of the Sun setting and it 's a very popular pretty popular site for just tourists just to go and get the beauty of the mountains with David yes thank you I think it is worthwhile noting that a number of the community boards points do focus on on flooding and I destroy your attention to the four point 10 the ocean alcohols of the variety ocean outfall probably of the gross returns but the storm water drains that go right along Marine Parade most of them are damaged and particularly in the North new brighton area and they are actually attributing to a large amount of flooding in the streets there so not only are we having issues with on the history frontage further up the coast there is a large amount of fact flooding that is attributable to the lack of repair on those stormwater drains I really like to probably focused and say that one of those one of the most significant aspects of the the board 's submission does center around the history edge we have a South bright and management domain management plan it does talk about stock banking in its in its text and we have been skirting around this issue for a long long time I appreciate that there are red zone designation but the area from bridge street down to caspian stream there isn 't absolutely no reason whatsoever why we cannot be getting on to that now and I would urge that this submission and particularly around that point be given some very serious consideration David we 're not actually debating I know and then then the south shore storm water outlets exactly the same taking all the iteri questions we 're just enforcers okay and 10 I 'm thinking just for quick ones up the motor home dump stations I 'm the really kind of invigoration around in brighton mall etc efforts somewhere around have you guys thought about you know if motor homes are coming to your area it means that it 's tourists and if they 're going to stop and do something then they may stop do something and do more if they 're in that area so maybe it 's something for you guys to talk about the guy as a dcl of whoever 's driving that to look at a station that 's closer to your commercial center rather than further away I supposed it having the dump station there we want them to come and stay you know so it wouldn 't necessarily be the placement for them to be able to park up and sit when you button so we 're looking at places that already-existing so they 're able to then go to South New Brighton campgrounds which has already existing self established and able to be used from thee because it 's only five minute drive from our center of New Brian just a specific location within five or ten minutes not probably but I do think you should do to earn with du ciel do some homework on the the way people travel because what you hear is a vision what I have a vision can I not be what people actually do and it 's the key for you guys to be looking at the regeneration you can take advantage of these guys so on the motor motor motorized kemp caribbean association of something don 't have in IA as well so really look at the habits in take advantage of it a good point okay and we 've hit it in the heath get river as well that 's one of the legacies left over from the earthquake is that the trapdoor which is the picture at the bottom that we 've had those and hit it as well because of the the different the new levels of the the river bead the tides changed that there gets more rubbish quarterman and one of the legacies is that our maintenance programs on those tripped systems is just going to be more because it but the upkick cleans previously dust doesn 't do it anymore but I would be interested because that that 's not right a picture desk don 't know right the top right that their system is designed and I 'm no engineer but I do know this because I 've been talking because regards to our area they need a full gear it because it 's very simple in there 's no falls Naples now I can see why we can 't just put trip doors on but although especially in our title marine area the maint it 's just all our is Jessica on it because you 've got to keep them clear a relevant of the system you use so that 's something that which should be locked it and just really quickly just on the point that you made with regards to the trig measurement around schools it really increased from seekers of ministry of education are shifting schools around etc they must hit a traffic management plan that the can 't_''_1488.97 do it without its health and safe well I don 't know what they don 't we had a meeting with a guy on what was the Pistons road and he got blown into the ditch by track so we went out to meet him because obviously being blown at eight year old being blown into a ditch by attract past does not ideal so we 're clear meet with him walking he was walking on the side of the road because there 's no footpaths you know and in the conversation we 're probably half hour into the conversation with staff and we said well you know there 's a Scott the schools just over the idea that there was a skull being built and that was opening in six months time the the marshland skull they had no idea that it existed this was being moved and that there was there was no plans for hot paths for getting those children to the soul so again which I went that 's where that 's we were coming from and this is there that got completely missed and we don 't want that to happen again things no it 's just you know I just think that there is an onus on the Ministry of Education with regards to health and safety to walking cleans and tragic things to give students to and so there 's something that we should be at least Leo 's the anus comes on us to pay get right okay well that comes down this but both ways because I mean it 's like it 's annie kenney the buses oh true sakuya we 've got to make things are in it but it 's all about the safety in but if they don 't have a plan if they create Christians but we will follow that up i mean i think it 's failing pauline and when I speak you I want to create the 48 the coastal promenade so you 've got written that any subsequent studies revising the report I would to be undertaken in consultation that 's correct are you aware that the intention of the time no around the promenade was that the existing studies I wrap around the dunes would also be taken to account existing science at your ears we were so okay so um just that you talked about in subsequent ones here the what I also want to ask you in relation to their besides the group who who talk to you a lot in relation to hear what kind of the full promenade and do you do you talk with resonance who who have an interest in making sure that the dunes also continue to provide a protective factor to brighten self blyton New Brighton in the whole city do though you disappear Finley yes they 're covered through the deadly until they come to you too easy yeah thank you representative in that area not get both sides that 's an amazing experience but more lame yeah thanks guys my question was about the swimming pool that you 're asking you 're suggesting that we investigate so much one big I don 't know this dude 4.4 point toes we talking about point five they want a provision of an additional pool and so good that would do business it would be within the same complex or standalone one within the same semicon take some time so you 've been looking at the whole comp is being made a lot bigger than to accommodate the support this is you put this is being Rick you know this is what our community are coming to us and what quite large numbers still asking yes so how far along arguable staining of it that this is not necessarily intended to be in this bill this is like Ben 's wait white and long-term plans a story that 's shooting graffiti proving we have allowed the saline to the future proofing so I 'll that 's cool yeah okay yeah all right and building that one end of it could be made so it can easily be okay it 's good things all right now I 've let you go well and truly over time to finish up with something please yes please okay look just time in time talking about the valves will the storm water pipes in South Shore I 've been dealing with the council staff quite a bit and I had a message sent to me awhile ago saying other low-lying areas like this have had pump stations spoke to protect them elves terrace nights drain bells crew etc if we want to solve this perhaps we should build some water pump station but that may be sending the signal their council would do whatever to protect this vulnerable part of South Shore doesn 't issue read that well hmm that 's from a backup well i think that the message that that yeah it 's a jewel message because it 's not that it 's not that there isn 't a desire to to provide the as much protection as you can I mean I hate the word all we want is what we had before him yes I know but we all want what we had before hand and I 'm afraid I 'm afraid the earthquake has actually caused significant damage across the city and so what we 're doing is prioritizing and the top priority was flocked her you know and it was and it and it remained so some of the exposures on the st side are over a 50-year sea level rise assessment based on computer modeling influence the work that we have to be doing and I understand that it is challenging for people because they 're making decisions now around rebuilding and repairing but those challenges are haven 't changed it all add send you a copy of the email that I 've sent to the empower Christchurch people and response to the information they sent in to us because it isn 't simple we are absolutely committed as a council to work in collaboratively with communities but it is going to be a long haul and it is going to be based on priorities based on the urgency of each of a monster flockton is well and truly down the tree so you know as we go through all of these different ones the correct approach will be developed for your area as well but it will take time it 's a sense of multi-million dollar managed recovery program and the biggest part of that is the investigations to figure out we the best spenders what we can do what engineering solutions there are etc so it 's really cool I appreciate that but clearing the red zone when they cleared the red zone they did more damage than the earthquake the when they cleared the red zone my foundations out and they made the land lower than it was the record that that is that is a component of the total amount of damage that has been done but we wouldn 't have been in the situation that we were on today if it hadn 't been for the earthquake sequence well i 'm saying is 00 lowered our land the red zone more than it was be even after the earthquake they took another half a meter off thats yeah i mean i haven 't got the exact what the exact amount but it is true that the removal of properties along that history age does make the inner side of their history more vulnerable success alerted the problem mmm yeah alright well thank you very much and you know great work that you 're doing on the community we 're hoping and the near future to be talking about delegations and a much more meaningful and holistic way so thank you very much for everything that you do for your community thank you very much thank you and now I would like _"

reduce because he thought he did indicate that he was going to respond to these issues when I came to the receive the reward yes i 'll press i make a comment that we made in there tation maybe slightly differently but with the same effect as long as there 's been portable to let an attack of little turn and bite of this is the fort and town exist side by side and need to exist outside and that means that the port management and the poor governance and the community and the community or would another community organizations need two babes to communicate and engage with each other certainly council in the deputation indicate that there it could be and that 's really based on a history i think of engagement not has been as good as it could be as well so the variation particularly related to the style and design opens my food ebay and the way I reputation by other the deputation was more ralph loosest and substance and it was around the fact that what it took the little creep lair as bringing these guidelines to set of design guide lysed some boredom staffed let 's do much in like a laboratory with counsel with no consultation really with the community other than consoles has happened prior to the recovery plan been adopted and the issue that we raised in the deputation real was that the community board and I think anecdotally to a large extent the community had disappointed that they weren 't involved front end of their protest give me issues that were raised in the recovery plan and consultations and subsequent earrings itself around damn prevail even seen as possible duplicate and sensor to the existing little our Center and the the design deputy by having an effect visually carriage turns been quite close by and and also just way this damn vividly my might be you I accessed so on Elizabeth the compensation community around us and I think the the view of the community was very much they would like to be engaged up front in any process it talks about the design of the damn paper area and this supported an extra story through the deputation today and in other ways that that hasn 't occurred that speaks to a wider issue of engagement between the community and not the best for a long time and I get their exits and environment where the community can interpret of the initiatives brought up wins there 's a an overriding conversation that goes on in little too around the recovery plan you go to something like well the poor get what that i will i 'll get their education but then the public it 'll probably others get mad actually not before to bring that may not actually be a genuine view of went commander but is influenced by the way that relationship is for the lists 20 that in the deputation is more where we do with recover can is the council on review does continue to take quite a staunch approach do a more relaxed approach the port of taken to some of the and directives that comes under the epic of repair and again that really is just making sure that poor do then men do them what they 're committed to do under there its actions the recovery plan but we don 't get we 're situated what the public realm is diluted or some of the public realm action as demand litter no we would have expected spoke it 's really against that background that we we receive subject the recovery man working part you 've continued to direct death that what we expect he 'll cover plan out comes the community ah as it is kind of just timed in replant and that we continue to work with the poor an assumption but they 're also out of a two different like the have areas where the ports and signals they 're wanting to push spine lines out maybe type things a comments that were made in protecting report we got yeah right yeah thanks could you just refresh our memory turn on a working party there are three councillors on working party myself Paul stage kitchen there are three community board members Christine Wilson who may be deputation to paint Paula spit the chair of bored than Jolliffe was not born and we really anger to the with the working party is rather or um met with staff and Emily ends well actually a number of canes to Argus direct deafened and to just how we deal with the matters that are directed in the recovery path rather than making directly with the boss there have been presentations from the port of the community board and the work party which have been useful but a lot of the work we 're doing over the band design issues or on some of the other execute of really in advising at staff on how they act very to use that have been put up on come staff so Oliver office office level we haven 't a governance government relationship with earth portal I toward would you like to come in other second you know I think it 's born the poor everything we 've had continued further like that really an opportunity to engage externally it 's more beam and staff governs even tried ft viktor poor but and I was a blue eating port and even there you describe em a potential for and revisions actions on and significant issues that will cap or to ensure that and securely and consistent with my community yeah I mean I think you know I this is a lot of relationship building that go both ways I do before you know that comment that was made about me my Victim us again for the unity which completely ignored the numbers ripped on the port reflected numbers of people were in littleton and inside the disengagement the sink require struggle and fundamental and any building that relationship and I aye sir and the main gist very plain context a little too covery plan it was it was very much a slightly more legal asst position but now it 's time to really build community engagement yeah announced I talked about there 's been an opportunity for the portent community to work together for the best for Dalton and baby now we 've gone through little pieces of how the various direction to recover the planet to be handled it might come for a meeting between the working group and appropriate people from the polls discussion Haven because we 've got a meeting of the work a scene actually might be good for us talk about what we want on the end of the debate and set it up at that time and reasonably crews working party us as well which is very important for anything is that you could see that working group is doing as far as the recovery plan shows that it 's working powerschool missing it than the of crews booth looking at easton I hate back to be happening but I 'm just assuming with you being both that we 're here on that yeah you 're not aware it well it 'll pass each other I see my toughest link between literally I just wonder with her that 's the center and I mean on the form a little resident myself was that not it from a child but as I do have our memories of going down to LA and she straight off was this incredible best lost of condition waterfront so something that even a mission to restore other and the torsion and recovery yes very much not much of Porter shoe but I confucian regardez commit timeline of course been going to get them the theory who didn 't bother it only captured as other under the place was amazed system to keep it very difficult to predict she don 't get this far and a trying to do and I 'll signal call of duty 's the tourist opportunities but is this is barrier would probably won 't be retried Angeles plan is implemented everybody oh those decisions will be made yeah what to do in the meantime I just so yes whether the cover eCampus is I mean I I supporter of airplane process such as why Peter support the reservation the cops I mean if we didn 't have this process you would have more and I don 't know when we need to start with her out of the port of entry it 's true we would remember the initial letter the quested recovery plan and the number of consent would be required to achieve the same as the recovery plan duct if we 'd done that business as usual environment but to kite on every terminal the level of a Miss he provided what the diamond have a fair return as big a huge concerns both little too now I 'm and harder and for a very long time long before any recovery lousy portal duration toba step over quite hunch percent of the poor with him so and what stage did we get everything as the council I got to give us little about the trip to co took us up on the offer yeah and spare top of briefing us though that is the keynote available and you can call up the chair any time and say we like and beaters and working parties hello I had a meeting with them not a weaker so much think maintain the idea was going for I mean we got food all the time as it would be really good the index of profound here 's my guess how much expense home is on what is concerted you 're thinking about where things are we do is we were just gonna tell your servants it 's all in the report yeah okay all of here before words so um but anyway I 'm thing as a city I think that watch um Christine was asking for him what really caught up on his coins this is to get that relationship building exercise here at the local level I 'm student it cannot make the chicken about a week ago and we do it in to bring them up for a briefing but John this question of organizing my prime to look at our annual plan together so it is going to the only other point I wanted to place was um if you look at what Paul 's doing now it is wider than also yes lots of does that prayer over after this so much yes detective awesome yeah the little horse recovery on we discuss wider with the littleton company then fine but I think that that 's really I think we 're promised and i will go to the point of remember sitting do we here and i 'll put their ocean first favors I first I know it Keri Russell properties for you _"

    "text": "and I wasn 't sure if a fixture of the russell TF and the earlier discussion okay oh are you at on that apply because we 've computation removing that does asian it 's the most or out a notice earlier on the ear which we submit all notes itself before what did we do this remind people cuz people sometimes lose the make of things because everyone 's on the street plan review committee but dumb so we submitted in favor of removing the designation of change of two on that disciplined so did or describe the piece of land aside designing ahead now the zone and then what the mr. was consorting on an intern I 'll try my best okay so and let 's type of Roger with an update on the view which started at quite last year or if April last year it resembled on this twice and final but was essentially meant buying from Canterbury and they provided irritations to the server invested in last year and beyond this year review process the minister will Tara put out a public notice and Otis he here Greenfield party area and that 's their area and around the the century adjacent to the Dakota pack exists to cross issue airport so just rusty road and so it 's all comments probe period we met at all that will come internet and agreed with what proposed I that the group area be uplifted the lanes recovery plan and that would also remember from that can regional statement however and the final move review all the final decisions on positive the mustard up to I 've left it brings a priority area designation wonderful better to school yes it is a minute to propose to uplifted and then decided not to get rid of em nice but not remember we offer I presume it was American spur in this mission they were probably dimensions which right for and against are lifting up so I instead of those and Sarah elements decided not to the designation and then the correspondence that are sane and this brilliant mention or simply lists the decisions that were made detach the loop doesn 't indicate the decisions they did so is there a be only dumb if you see website I provide a link to it my report to you in turn to page if I want to there 's a link to the young and I think somebody entation or not orbit and be next to the ball instead of publicness okay so you get that notice here eat their public notice you 'll see there 's no reference to the ad agree fuel rod yeah but just to touch not answering the question to be and the one issue does not eat resolve from what was currently full in pin here is and all as what stoning will be there so you can imagine and we have a hierarchy of panel commence and live enough even that I we need to give a feat to as per the plan review and that 's saying well with interior as a Priya actual uses a matter of resigning to industrial who needs to be decided on by the end up in here in spam now the hearing people that was just as you to list the stage the zoning sisters current years which name was Jesus through web fringe I think it 's no subdivisions avoid it is that 's all carry on such an anticipated rule I 'm so that the independent here in spa was you make a decision on that reason it definitely has a much position that the nothing that they in appearing pound all their district and all those places mr. plan can be inconsistent the provisions of blue that 's great um however and in terms of considering the independent parents and water need to address and the issues that been raised touches them truck constraint and the Republicans boobs we write the theme was that the potential produced for the show Exodus to the state highway which is adjacent to it that 's a huge concern yes so that the pyramid balance that directional not been and consistent with the liberty to give a pic to the regional policy statement with the concerns raised and lack of strategies of three development in teacher to shoot associated with opening it up adjacent to tear highway network would be of God more real weapon to change poster and find the submissions on on the website so they 've best be here the crap what was the joined up ground position honor in terms of the EU or in terms of very early so that gives the district plan review or two on the loop the crown proposed minister proposed to uplift the designation but didn 't do it that 's part of the district plan giving a reason why leaves it 's a bit of a quandary because I 'm not out there realizes i 'm not a player they don 't was an assistant we got involved invest missions as no regresas to be managed and the thing that probably waiting to see two daughters as we end up in adherence panel which we receive but its independent here is kind of like the decision about hearing any more solutions and completely without the knowledge of a little weird so that did that rather than make that decision and beans off of lib because loop hasn 't changed us will have a greenfield property area sitting on top of it but as I as I mentioned left statement the other issues that we raised by our evidence as others of you know track via associated with them typical access to state highway and other infrastructure strengths as well so there r peterson of the opinion that i 'm trying to understand how have the minimalist we out and publicly soldered on tonight and hey that 's just not include be here first determination or was it for the purposes of this really everything could be still awaiting a final result no the lent recovery plans for beauty i don 't think the xenian team describes our with make me feel thanks to obviously there would be i just drew for the minister I didn 't do it quick recovery um is recovering and store with white afforded to to them to the regeneration act yes of you just get a memo on yeah on the final submissions I can 't exactly did we do a quick analysis it 's awful missions they don 't come to us so they went to Dara and Sierra consider them and Jubilee provide advice to the minister you didn 't we I slip into the Mercer cause at the moment we 're we 're still shooting in the battery we don 't know why he didn 't see what the descend to resolve it communities there 's no lift given my visit what looking for the submission of the submission good we 're looking for the submissions for ministers public truth of the year party today that I YP on me it came inside although not because it wasn 't a minister ye kam SE return line beyond the DPC we 've talked about a chick there okay so if you could get it will be a lot of public and trust and and one why I did proceed into how the independent hearings because I mean I think our if that 's on the strap going to the paramount because I mean we were very clear that our objection to to the designation remaining was that he was the impact on the UM turn out of antipathy and away and the huge amount of work is going on there at the moment but that they 're here is just going fast time it 's going to be a very very challenging area so I 'm just can 't see that 's not need to us is it changes designation in that regard I consider okay yeah yeah check um in a submission we supported area 3 possibly yeah said it might be appropriate to the entire area tree but we support a population of around so we so just confused just try to understand they 're going to turn that the community is over here for it not very well you know Syria an hour session we said sure anymore were an ancient shouldn 't be business attire yep so then you need to think that it was three so much more comment opportunities as part of this process and and and when we first start engaging with spear honest over here a guy now we will still consider the work on what the instruction constraint were so we faked the issue to the minister that there were these fancy and then by the time we got to the e noticed something put it really this year we 're done we agree it should be uplifted so that 's that it was a proposition on yeah very good all right we got the urgency you can do you know what 's not look that way I 'll put the motion although I my face thing okay it 's very much transport establishment so I 'm sort of Simon 's let 's seek and with some discussion about the report i think is really care and i guess in some ways it depends on erringer protection hell verse or other for finished work and i hope will work just take it back a step we as a council have a grievance pull it up such a committee its first thing yelling turn is it is fair and brooke fit destroy PT committee it doesn 't necessarily achieve everything for last it 's a running covered pretzel okay what are we all understand me I think what 's important is it is also clear that it can be and I believe must be twisting to a GP there are plenty of waste weekend in time set up so the French authorities of that to the legislation around the funding of our transport hubs these pluses but in fact we must work why what the support is in the other the other two smaller Council are we that the st2 for smaller district councils to really start the starting on fourth however that 's a simple that um it may have a pastry fix we have for the young people about that tonight and look at that is for all together report to come to our infrastructure for Environment Committee the parts around roading and and and the bacteria or motivate our end up with the part around a stabilized underway we 're in will the star rocks vote no question that the better medical we muster and I think we 're in endless on that is operating system so in the report if plea and that there 's an emphasis on working collaborative and profitably and I think it 's what we need to do it staged some to tinley I 'm happy to move via staff recommendations to be counts pretty asian girls edification you 'd like to move the recommendation there 's been a lot of info discussion like that 's really good and it does connect a bit time left and answers they 're really up actually that Liam me as indicated that she would have had time energy and stills tutors can be so I and I 'm also is that all the work it out supporting kata has done publicly working group which really isn 't it is a full round with us Pauline has also agreed to app when I forward and engineering the last other transport will be proved I 'm also prepare to my name so and I think the guts to hear a greater of your names up and Linnet them here for doing it it 's a 12-time ops I 'll second the motion in and speaking do it just simply say that I 've a grateful for my name board for discussion because I want to signal how important public trans borders to study it seems to me that the earthquake experience it here is that was actually an opportunity to be and it 's probably a measure of Samson 's opportunity as a as a country really to to put right the situation here it is in an able us to trial the vice of eating people around was a city that still does not provide the final flow of direction that it will do and it 's completely recovered and a match morning and agile and nimble system then I feel preferable then sting to root and then introducing up and spoke model at a time when people were already quite devastated by the earthquake and actually not following the same traditional patterns of study so I think it was a mistake to introduce quite a method change to the system that although you can stay in through consultation and there was missions and hearings ionized munira Parliament approach to them anything was like the rigid Council that I 'm staff members to local new Brian people could ever say her the post changes in those areas now she found a submission that I made to City California and your plan at the time about how the need was for an interchange every bride not because it was a so much in terms of a central position it was it was a hub-and-spoke same time but was at the end of spoke and actually the model model never worked for placed slightly brighter because simple bus bus services terminated brighton was the leader harry on down the surprise birth the amount of image that was done in their area of jury duty that it right much smaller buses should have been feed us a straight away at book I think 200 years four feet of us to be put around ellington area that was affected by the closure of the gays or overt you know there is so many different elements and I guess I know that East bit of them then then a lot of forward to the services I used to catch us and attack every Friday night but I 'd get off it bus interchange so when when the businesses came to us and written and told us what the impact of having a bus interchange in the middle of a shot roopesh I knew that what they were telling so it happens the truth because town so you know it 's um I think this sometimes it 's been I I know that one of the counselors challenge me on the use of a ground truth the likud ground truth and if you understand what a particular favorable model is actually going to do when you want young people like the one behave in the morning who won 't get on the bus because they don 't know we better count on it and have to wait for the further strike route to come on and connect up with a hub and if to get on and off buses like across the busiest roads and Christchurch to do so I just think that our system is broke and it needs of saying Tower City be leading the way not not following and hot this year so I 'm sort of putting my stake in the ground by going on to a committee not the result I want I don 't want a joint public transport complete it 's controlled by the Legion and by the two small district councils I want the Christchurch City Council transport system that enables you know sigh close to use the buttons as well it enables people to get around the city smoothly in enables people to have the freedom to move and at least in jail and I don 't believe for one minute that the benefit is experienced by those who view the bus alone and for those who say pulling up the bus fares is the way to resolve the problem of decreased patronage I would suggest that it 's probably the reverse that would be true jusef affairs you but you make the buses reliable and way more efficient than getting in car to make the driving experience better for everyone stays empowers you make the cyclic Syrian better for everyone and it makes us travel the priority that it should be so that you can get where you 're going a lot quicker if you do those things then you 'll have an excellent system which is what those young people were told they were coming to Christ Jewish to experience so there I am gonna give up can I just ask because whenever you cars and buses at the risk of banging on about will it be a commitment for this organisation to look around I 'm absolutely so I want I want us to use all of the new technologies that coming we have to drive on a trip a day but it 's kyle car available for council stuff to use and other next week story um you know we can talk to you about a simple booking system see and give it a go and but also there are buses that are being developed that can run on my oh yeah and simple systems that can run on rail and road I think that 's the solution because that would really get people moving very quickly it was a gentleman that came to one of the season and it 's putting a solution he 's got a whole lot of makin on the Volvo bus playlister the wheel go up and they can go out as I go from darf you or your old whatever and hop off so when it comes to crossing wheels go I just drive on the 't model that anyways it performs with each foot and hash it and if we look at it I appreciate it going to happen and but as i hope happens for a very variable time only and if we look at the possible model and we look at this one this one gives again three resist 63 ribs in so 11 and then didn 't you person on and why met one so the people who will pay I to the center the cost of this model it a third of the ribs intention on this group and I think it is wrong I think the model is wrong and there isn 't it wrong is because of the current the system abs and because the government has not been sufficiently valle de public transport into the city capsule we have a clear hierarchy of what is friends be okay by a cast and there 's a model of what or what we back system on we have two choices either there are more hypnosis we leave the cast stand where I we cancel the unlit episode she is and years gets to control a public transport takes wife I off the budget it reduces the heavens folk model that nobody really wants to change routes that people really don 't know where to go to and so the cata bus because they don 't know that again does these things all we have for the particular model takes the roads and all that goes on the rise out of the council structure and puts it into a separate company in many ways that even worse we could be trying to build a community in any way you absolutely have to have that space that the road and so I don 't like the system at all and I got for my vote against to go through I don 't like the fact that this for example budget and so one for public transport infrastructure is a huge 2000s messer they get a good representation big budget and I make public transport infrastructure for five thousand houses for men and so what we have here is I 've make-do solution because the government will take the move to public transport in we glued on committee by Megan sperwan and all the decisions that affect their area nobody 's talking about taking over it at least but i think this one just leaves so many and the wing things to happen we know habitable has to innovate we know that if we go to lead our obligation changes in terms of the fumes that we use we know that people do one famous is they don 't know where to tell it that whatever cycles answers all of those things I appreciate this is make the best of me said we 've hardly but and if people are relative to try and make it work appreciate it but I just think that we lift in a situation cuz we make up looked at did not come and have to say this one and it can or also said that knife or not touching about stopping this possible solution being established encouraged which function lies should be administered by area along every other aspect of what part bikes cars robes effort lights all of those things that has been canceled controls so important three assists and I is stated a reflection on the fact that we had an audible system in place for food controls in school and linking thank you I was a quarter neither i think it 's so fun to meet that act ii the head of service model Oh competing companies providing a public service is that are by the problem the passenger transport system doesn 't work think of all the company to run isn 't_''_1685.61 to provide the best possible service for the passenger list but mike n proper as small through a competitive tendering septum what does being shot and crush it too late tourists to the bottle so when we ate buses on the rights that our district on wheels they give pull not break etc um is it anyone knows what we actually need and we should be particularly and asking governments and a price disaster environment even though i think it but before the earthquake that the funding world for public in the transport is rock city like christchurch huge expenditure we 're going through in terms of being asked to fun disaster and we still have a competitive system that actually doesn 't enables us to give the benefit yep hey this is it rather private companies making my offer so I think the model fundamentally wrong knots from the back of the original council runs the house hasn 't it best for decisions and that it is funny meeting wondered so to be innovative things around up Frank juice I spheres or free bus fares which I think would be fantastic if you really want to merge chef we restrained because of all these competitive tendering things I have to get ok so now I think it 's a real shame we haven 't been able to get the opportunity to build read them actually what was I think historic crusher a world-class bus system when it was actually a transport board that delivered that processor and it was recognized I think it well wrong world and it 's right just being honest that was simple video p do whatever ice was now you 've got different color buses going up and down you could the complaints that come in to use and so we 're also interested by day and because go have put an extra day plan excuse me on I 'm fixin to shop without any decision about it and is really really so um I appreciate that just there 's nothing Tron have a little bit of a greater side but I don 't think it goes anywhere near enough we should be actually a breaking government with I think Owen reasons why we should actually have ever take public residue test for speak i change the funding models I thought I 've had better days what we continue to do so I 'm Glenn and in turn and then I think I support this is stephen future steps will naturally bring public transport crawl back into the fold of a fully accredited authority we 've seen what happened over i have spokesmodel the feed structure into the conference if it back into the fold of a credit body it is a leverage that existed just you know they little voice of a moment to go to the car the commissioners okay air control pressurize so to do anyway bitter thing goes back to us together by but I think this is what a fully integrated system under partly and your boss calls so the reason for this because I 've been being as a service industry hit dat not young people who are comfortable they were on the bus etc and I don 't black bass right as if there 's not a sport magnet boiling to stiffen when there is an unruly on a gray surface on the bus but when you 're in a competitive tendering process you can have one company that as Brenda Starr uplifting and abseiling those frontline staff to make it a piston or um or the ride etc but if the others diet join on it then you are the idol and you will be for a while and I three best if we can have site and the waiting 's and those contracts and that type of thing with it I think there 's open it 's what got to get the other standings a fastest end of the day as a service industry for this is just a clean out what you 're saying what you saying I don 't we 're running MSSP will belongs I don 't think that 's a good at all what 's important is that we 're not losing anything else we 're not giving anything away there 's no pentavalent anybody else that the comparative pass you can make recommendations for us for the different territory authorities so it 's a very positive things in it to about how we can make future poetry sport and in fact and yes it should be long happen and energy-efficient and it 's very clear in the terms of reference is what this new committee it could be dead filter it well leading the developer whole joint work program by 30 I understand the concerns of next week but I urge all councils to support the recommendations um I 'm sorry I didn 't see you and there 's those pies so um because I don 't see you i 'm just gonna let so when nobody can call me over the coals for free Thanks oh and get support equality recorded their future go away she control triskele just what may do another withers by the capital of transport barbieri to I mean I decided and support it was once or twice don 't_''_2080.24 that the reason that I think I see it was there I have made it crystal clear take a date ah being appalled converse is not a menage one and third out dudes but we have public life from the map that we related which is that strong belief councils and is to lead the public treats system for time study and obviously and this engagement was my my career II food the institutions ah steepletone immediately move from hatchet seek to return every working day the charges and the three morning and challenges and later a song that we had to work on and take responsibility for to it because that 's the only way that gonna tell time so I just wanted to make it crystal clear it going does pathway for me is not the end of my absolute command to continue to be simple dozen for restoration of fully functioning transport system fully I wonder strike castle and fully involved so I 'm all those in favor say aye I say no it 's care thank you no no I 'm okay

officials to that I feel that it is important that we we review and consider a little sister than here and we have proposal so with these people I really to stop title and editor I know originally planes built leave up to tonight meters high and they 're always tended to be entering and so this practice was just carrying out a rigorous risk for us to assist disability and range of learnings

significant can see they 're moving through the debris for granted earthquake and they split up that very well every time there is birth quick vinaigrette accelerations I mean if there is certainly

there 's a your attention to take any corrective measures to stop linkage of these dangerous topics say there were some seepage the stuffing testability possibly like I think the stifling is noticed during high tides or the rain Philippians has a number of mechanisms which could be cause one could be there is a flip a means of pipes which leaking through the Sonics and so it 's convene to me and stop make that way so what we 'll do is we should be carried out on the sectional surveys make sure it deep respect any 32 swept and created in part of detail design I will have to be requesting that drainage in the phone case as well so seepage through things is quite low no think that 's caused all most of what makes means number of other mechanism to carry those 12 hours were specific moment where we don 't think it 's think it 's an you city character going out and checking some tomorrow good and secondly the floor effective apart and good question am I more further chief executive or supposed to some in recent weeks we 've had issues below Broad Street which time rather than that report probably can 't wear provide start bringing up but its its purpose are they issues going to come before council so we 're not perfect that I rather than ever just wanted to the post downstream flow fix we can discuss them at some search in the near future yeah but I think that simple service and this is this better report done for councils what you think what we 're singing to the community groups that hit right the shoot button the area that you 're talking about is where they say I 'm going to try to track the confluence of the UM up the title answer and neither in the weather stylist banks are effective against river yeah big way but not the title coming up that way there are a number of things to address in that area but there will will see from the report it there 's quite a lot of with it an area so it will be but it it 's bigger if do because it 's not about stopping it 's not know the other oh it makes better there is word okay it just want effective up on that XD instead of Christians you for the would sort of few questions here will this these are pretty stopping spread the clash to static official the it 's right in water coming up beneath the ground everything to something reasons we have to look with on the ropes that 's around stopping so this one 's my any mechanism in them so used and what again come through with the differential between 5n granules there 's potential for that turn gray screen what a little Tom the other time sure in justify i hope this I can 't get it on really quickly just falsely strict with the South New Brighton campground is is like a schematic I know you you 're not necessarily saying this weather specs will guard that just in the report all of campground is a new private yes is a plea that the sandbags of simplified not offer protection really please set up in the air using that 's a coastal erosion issue here notice Mexican taking the coastal erosion as far as I 'm seen right 0 posts at idle foundation ok so there 's another time frame together and it 's in this practice of you this inundation is not looking at all the diversion issues apart from for petitioners and stop being such as which is part of the issue I want of a dress that whole south of the street which is outside of what you are bringing to us today there 's a substantial issue that needs to be dressed and debated and there are a number of questions that I 'd like to raise which are outside not going that there is a strong just ought to have that I can 't ask the questions in front of this forum unless you have paper addresses but this paper does not very specifically anything downstream of British it doesn 't it doesn 't and and the the ocean a raisin at all downstream of bread street not they need their protection with vulnerability comes from the from the house yeah again I 'm just a title uses the the river yeah so I I think that one one of the things that we probably need to do is to to get it item on to this agenda and I don 't like that Richards on the room is not that I think that a report from the strip and review committee to Castle would bring it a shoe to the agenda it might be the right door just because I 'm certainly comes up I know I come on this a deep right now because it 's not relevant to the paper you know it 's an important shoot and every council is aware of it so yeah you know and it 's done this in the public interest and their show as well so it seems to me that because one of the one of the depth sides of the removal the coast protests chapter from just plan review is that there is a distinct allowed history side to continue so if asked the district nine review support to analyze their quest and to come back to us there 's no reason why that report can 't come back at all so it would actually bring to to to the council table I think it 's just what third one yeah it 's big way though just it 's 6.17 we 're sitting beside the total force decreases obviously you 're one thing on it but I just the point it 's still very important there 's still strong tile at first but the river flowing becomes a dominant force to do ok so this hard there 's no not a flood and play in the from Satara runs a pretty high even there so due to model the peak flutterings with a high so to give means from a media yannick defecated I just wanted to check yeah replaced anything i bleep area although that wasn 't area that just get so there is near with textplus being an opposition next with a pluggable starts with B stands by significantly richland design little 11-2 's in this will be part of this book if I would think been able to determine it is unoccupied return properties that are affected by flooding and B string beans day today of course this procedure but it 's looking at we didn 't need to provide protection what sets block by Victor price stop as artificial point butyrate for stopping section and give notice is it doesn 't stop link of the tune and what is the first thing me but spoken what will that look at our legs rationally right don 't do the numbers of people in the downstream the middle upper Tommy Owens is quite a significant amount well in the middle and the top string that are occupied Green Zone properties and there 's been focused for protecting in in an hour session there are no green zone profits and risk letting that will be was reviewed going through the desire to make sure we 've got that clear right venom guts to even par so X so they get to like is this going to be just like you know that 's why section which is going to have be stopping space to you erase stuff ends the NSM pattern looking it going from the night well we 're looking at local drinking just there as well I 'm to be full of the plants noticed in the road a bit number doesn 't tuning the basics so it will be addressed know and just final question I had was just Erica to understanding like four million dollars called clever the money ever has to response but I keep saying that we 've had from here each side is a response to that when commander ran to the morning stop X dams I don 't touch I get the full billion dollars in spending it 's just for images are copied approach are these gameplay solution and what 's the con it 's my friend getting the paper so there is tap restart banks I expect of design lot of 20 years I will take you get decisions of red zone and just move forward with puns banking it 's good posture but I mean just in terms of things like no private yeah I really do think that it 's a little bit Dean Dixon libraries it 's a good idea i know i do anything I mean we talk to the crowd starts talking to them about each of the red side we 've got people that back again are we talking about three years yes sort of physical it is the answer you know my personal view from what I understand the chat is that it decision store faq 's did submit now that work need to be done in terms of the road we have to do in the future the future of dumb Braud with there 's a whole lot of work done but it 's been done in a collaborative way castle and it was made pretty clear and a little expectation swiftly signed off the regenerate crash future terms of looking to them for are said to be very much a part of the regeneration of the city so in terms of the correspondent that refugee you know we 're at work I 'm you know I 'm quite believable if it was solid I was of the of the memorandum the every 3 councilor he said this week it 's just to make sure that they 're we 've completely on the same patch we need to get these things resolved but as you all know we 're talking about sea level rise which is what the crystal and a Dacian do is about and we 're talking about sit right with me about production modeling d200 is that so you know your isn 't that I 'm there 's no impending sense of urgency but it is something that we need to resolve and in the meantime we do need to have these temporary stop the bags the management option that had been selected by the machine must are supported by the committee I think we do need to get it underway as quickly as we possibly can I 'm ball just go to the kitchen to get out to directly million you know these the views are as to if you like this sunny higher level suits my the same thing as to surround II i guess the probability of a lot so me they might stop the main trouble looking here increasing oh this is the point i don 't know how long it takes it 's going to be a number is but it 's difficult about me you very much hope it 's not going to but you know from cost-effective view that this is a time frame that we come but and pre interest off backs up to the life in work i should take that and obviously the option three de minimis replace the same a section now if we were to leave the other seasons be i think you 're feeding works in tongue to kind of keep their nations will need to be worked on as time progresses so rather than I guess before million at this point to get intently to a state with the Magnus is this they do minimum of two would require funds to buy more it to get enough they just because we is very much dependent on quick events on farming systems com well in lumens me some of the dental stuff things has been through Simba

cool I siskins and there um I just was interested today this is a font this a foundation I hips I else we 're sauce it was really stressful I 'm not quietly oh ass the position well yeah just wondering why you 're often we 're not issuing infringement notice those and it did that those customers better change and stuff personnel and I just wonder what we 're doing to address that got four because we don 't see very showing we haven 't_''_54.539 been assuring infringement notices when we talking about increasing the fines which konica left at the point was made around the freedom camping stuff if we 're not going to enforce the current infringement ray-j why are we increasing the fines I can 't answer that but I 've influence to the asset a solution fine presuming that you know when it was prior to this business 100 offline and you it 's just just on the side note this is here capsule sup not Richard image analysis in the last few years to do change in personnel oh it does set it verifies presented greater two-tier to listen and listen one other serious now just suppose yeah I don 't mind it including the fine but if we 're not issue infringement notices do you have staff would you want a resolution it 's sister we need tobe rhe enforce a plans as am i I just forgot my the uplands of tinder you know recovery and um ok so can I move an additional it does i think that the process that once you coming back um notice that the following selection of the public notification period staff of the theater or to the full council through city to the proposed change increase an improvement based approach and penises so i can put it to count at the same time so if you just want a note that there will also be Russian Beijing as well yeah Oh take that motion

with me no need to do is just amazing before I tell you much of the big fresh market which is what picking really but you know thank you to just an oversight on this okay so what I 'm about to but something to move we receive the happy report Jamie there any discussion I know Kerry strategy and clients find a reference I just look for the cover an update to the situation earlier and in the meter in the same noticing recommendation and we would like to move on and seconded by only did you hear Christians you know I just thought don 't know comfortable night immediate action that my way to the port of a brief the counselors wandering around with a meeting with directors the community for the local community board so effectively peacock useful I 'd like to hear from Andrew piece because he thought he did indicate he was going to respond to these issues when it came to the mistake the room yes you know i 'll press I make be kind of made in there tation maybe slightly here I 'm differently like the same effect as always has been a portable to let an attentive little turn and bite of this is the fort and town exist side by side and need to exist side by side and that means that the port management and the poor governance and the community and the community order another community organizations need two babes to communicate and engage with each other certain comments on deputation indicate that there are times when that engagement isn 't as good as it could be and that 's really based on a history I think of engagement not been as good as it could be as well so the variation particularly related to the style and design the urban by a deputation was more a loose esten substance and it was around the fact you ought it 's good the little creep lair that 's bringing these new guidelines to set of design guide by some or them stabbed but I 've too much in like a labret of consultation with counsel with no consultation really with the community other than consoles has happened prior to the recovery plan been adopted and the issue that we raised in the deputation real was the the community board and I think anecdotally to a large extent the community are disappointed that they weren 't involved the front end of their protest given me issues that were raised in the recovery plan and consultations and subsequent hearings itself around damn prevail even seen as possible duplicate Ernst answer to the existing little power center and the design deppe by having an effect visually on that part of little certain the the nature of historic heritage gems been quite close by and and also just wave it dampier the game i might be you but accessed so on as the compensating community around was very much they would like to be engaged upfront to any prospective talks about the design of the damn paper area at this supported an extra story through the deputation today and in other words that that hasn 't occurred that speaks to wider issue of engagement between the community and certain not the best for a long time and i get there exists an environment where the community kind Oprah I two of the young initiatives for up wins there 's a an overriding conversation that goes on in little too around the recovery plan goat something bike well the pork get what they will get their education but then the public if it 'll probably others get mad actually not before spring that may not actually be a genuine view of went to Atlanta but is influenced by the way that relationship is for the last 20 30 or more did so I put some points the cream is making that in the deputation is more where we do with recover plan is the Council on memory you just need to take quite a staunch approach doing the and directives that comes under the epic of replay and again that really just making sure that poor do then men do what they 're committed to do under their obsessions the recovery plan we don 't get to associate what the public realm is is God pitted or some of the public realm action and luz de matinee that though we would 've expected spoke it 's really against that background that we we receive subject the recovery man working part you 've continued to direct death that what we expect he 'll cover plan out comes the community as is kind of just timed in replant and that we continue to work with the possible assumption but they 're also out of a two different like the have areas where the thoughts and signals they 're wanting to push spine lines out maybe type things a little bit so maybe a step or just by linking the comments that were made in protectors yeah right yeah thanks could you just refresh our memory turn on a working party there are three councillors on working party myself Paul Wilson who may be deputation to paint paula smith the chair of board down Jolliffe is enough both improve and we of really anger to the width of the working party is rather or um met with staff and um and as well as like a number of occasions to Argus direct deafened and to show me how we deal with the matters the Earl directed in the recovery path rather than meeting directly with the boss there have been presentations from the port community board and the work party which have been useful for a lot of the work we 're doing over the urban design issues or on strim a better execute of really in inviting out staff on how they act very to use that have been put up on come staff so Oliver office level we haven 't done governance government relationship with the port in neeb I know perhaps my face on there my view toward would you like to come others say that you know i think it 's around we 've had continued further like that really an opportunity to engage external it affected poor but and I was eliminating yellow character port and even there you describe em a potential for and revisions and positions on and on significant issues that work at the port 2 i 'm sure that cost and situation security and it is a different with both the community in cap yeah I mean I think you know I is this a lot of relationship building that go both ways I do before you know the comment that was made about that might 've be my victim must appear for the unity which completely ignored the numbers worked on the port reflected numbers of people in littleton and inside the disengagement the sink require struggle and fundamental and any building that relationship and I aye sir and the major very plain context a little too covery plane it was it was very much a slightly ridiculous positions but now it 's time to really build community engagement yeah absolutely no first make comments when the career plan was announced I talked about there 's been an opportunity for the portent community to work together for the best for the various direction to recover planet to be handled it might time for a meeting between the working groove and and upriver people from the port the best discussion because we 've got a meeting of the work custine actually might be good for us talk about what we want on agenda for that beat and set it up at that time and reasonably Christmas working party as his blow which is very informational or even is that you could see that working group is doing as far as the recovery plan ohs that it 's working powerschool missing a defender of crews booth looking at easton I hate that to be happening but I 'm just assuming with you being both that we 're here on earth yeah you 're absolutely not not wear it well it 'll pass each other I see my toughest link between literally I mean I just wonder why that wasn 't a good chance the other thing that I took resented and I mean on the former little resident myself was but not it from a child which is I do have our this incredible loss of connection waterfront self things that mean a mission to restore other and the total recovery yes very much not much of Porter shoe but I completion regard just come with a timeline of course been going to get the theory and on other educators other under 58 was for my system to keep it very difficult but if she don 't get the fudge and a trying to do and I 'll signal duties and a tourist opportunities the diamond harbour this is barrier but probably won 't be reached Dwight into this plan is implemented love you buddy oh those decisions will be made what to do the meantime I just so yes but every campus is I mean I I supporter of airplane prices which is why their support reservation the cause is coming if we didn 't have this process you would have multiple years of resources see occasions and multiple years appeals and I don 't know when we start with her it 's true hybrid we will remember the initial letter the quested recovery plan and the number of consent would that if we 've done their business as usual environment but to kite on every terminal the level of a Miss he provided what the diamond have ferriter as big a huge concerns both little to no harm in Harbor in for a very long time long before any recover if that was even thought of you can tonight so um direction toba step over quite hun percent of the ball with hers so and what stage did we get everything as the council ago I think I was level about to the chairman CEO took us out on the offer yeah and spare time briefing us though that is the king of valence you can call up a chair any time and say we like and beaters and working parties hello I 'm making with them madhulika so much there was an entertaining the idea was a very common issue brief the country type of thinking around going for I mean we got food all the time as it would be really good the index of profound here 's ma here 's how much expenditures having is on what is we were just gonna say you 're so perfect it 's all in the report yeah totally all of it ever forwards so um but anyway I 'm thing as a city I think that watch um Christine was asking for him what injuries related up on his coins is to get that relationship building exercise here at the local level I 'm suiting it can make the chicken about a week ago and we do it in to bring them up for a briefing but it 's efficient of organizing my prime to look at our annual plan together let 's go it is going to the only other point I wanted to place was um people get reports doing now it is why but also yes lots of does that air over to this sir yes doing that also yeah there are some poor recovery pain as a statutory documents we 're receiving an update we discussed wider with the Littleton ample company in five but that 's really um I think we 're promised and i will go to the point do we have put their I him and move on the five Jamie than one minute questions it 's like slime just a little left optimal by 10 to the price t8 recommending just through what starts the community portal is made aware off the surface property or the property virgin so for this meeting weapon catchers report and policies we did see a nerve with the attached list of properties to look in that he warn 't_``_1207.63 it will be the stuff on the process police immediately for must be in the next month or sick right this all the boards in work with the community governments thing in the community would develop causal touch ok I 'll stop motion all those in fact that there 's a face I know that scary nice a number Eddie Skinner like

new proceed on any part of the fundraisers offense all right how much ok you knows they 're running in fear you know I 've been asked to take part of it so I think you do this it does your dancing

aye I say no clue I 'm glad the 'm one spring washers report and this is a matching paper with some to move that we go for some le sick today are there any questions make commenter interesting nothing that I see here is position and the Masters of an outfit this is that it 's good to see this Rick 2500 hollow point you could get all these things cooking elevation yeah just love that the focus has been on actually giving media people on to properly that 's right yeah yeah just across my mind was will direct with me ask force for jobs I know everything now that does exist somewhere in the organization with the big point up with this yeah well we had not played role the last couple of years in something that that I thought we put on the agenda for the new skin yeah be the me but I 'm sure did it will be a leader okay all that 's okay to say I fine okay Harry ninja tribute and then eat everything okay and I wasn 't sure a texture of the russell TF and the earlier discussion the ocean it 's the most pour out a notice air on the air which we submitted roll notice it sell for what did we do this remind people cuz people sometimes lose the focus things because everyone 's on the street plan review committee but dumb so we submitted in favor of removing the designation to change of two on that explained so if you 'll all just described the piece of land aside designing ahead now the zone and then what the master was consorting on an intern I 'll try my best okay so and just a fraud you with an update on the view which started at play last year or april last year it resembled on the spice and the final but was essentially meant buying from Canterbury and they provided irritations to the server invested in the last year and beyond this year review process the minister will zero put out a pop of notice and I just see saw premier the public about what now see the even here greenfield park area and that 's their area and around the the simply adapted so just frosty road and so it 's all comments bro period we stood on that will come internet and agreed with what proposed I that the the group you 'll prob area be uplifted one other than angels recovery plan and that would also remove from that can regional or statement however and the final move review all the final decisions on also the mr. desire to have left that prefer priority area designation 14 bitter to school this is only a minute to propose you uplifted and then decided to get rid of em I 'm not that not that I 'm aware of I presume it was him it up considering this machine they were probably the best what 's right for an against uplifting up so I instead of those and Sarah laments decided not to that the designation and then the correspondence that are sane and this really no mention of it simply lists the decisions that were my details the loot and decay the decisions the roommate so is there a record of the submissions believable yeah it so there will be only dumb report to you okay if I want to there 's a link to the and I 've include somebody entation or not water but and he looks to the for the public me just so you can see that notice here that public notice you 'll see there 's no reference to the only agree feel variety but just to touch your answering the question to be and the one issue is not yet resolved on what does Charlie for the IMP in here is an old is what stoning will be for the bed so you can imagine and we are a hierarchy of plan documents and love enough even it i 'll definitely need to give a fee to as per the plan review next saying well with interiors appropriate lateral uses a matter of resigning to industrial who needs to be tied on by the independent hearings now the hearing people that just as soon as you to list the stage the zoning sister current years which is a revival or even friction miss you as the name would suggest fringe I think it 's noted what time so that the independent here in spin was you make a decision on that reason it definitely got so much position that that nothing that the in appearance county district and all the place of the step plan can be inconsistent the provisions of blue that street and river and in terms of custard ring the independent parents and water need to address e and the issues that been raised touches them the truck constraint and the Republicans do we write the theme was that the potential produced for the shed with access to the state highway which is adjacent to it that 's a huge concern yes so that the pyramid balance that directional knocking and consistent with the lib you have to give a pic to the regional policy statement with the concerns raised and lack of strategies of three development in teacher to shoot associated with opening it up adjacent to it there I won 't network would be of God more real weapon to change proposed a pretty big clock somebody to anyway but can 't find the submissions on on the website so they was the joined up ground position honor in terms of the EU or in terms of area of leg so that is the district plan review or two on the loop the crown proposed all the minister proposed to uplift the designation but Dennis do it as part of the district plan giving a reason why leaves a bit of a quandary because I know that they have realized I 'm most of the or they don 't was an assistant we got bottom fist missions as Norris easily managed and the thing that probably waiting to see two daughters as we looking at here is panel questions we receive but the independent here is Panik right the decision about hearing any more solutions and completely without the knowledge of the solution so that did that rather than make that decision Indians of lube because loop hasn 't actual still have a Greenfield priority area sitting on top of it but as I as I mentioned that we have to hire the need to do not being consistent with their of regional pot statement the other issues that we raised its associated with them to access to state highway and other infrastructure strengths as well so there will be a certain of the opinions but I get to understand how have the most we can publicly soldered on tonight and hey it 's just not include may be here first stettin the night or was it for the purposes of this beautifully everything could be I 'm not still awaiting a final result no the lens recovery plans for dude I don 't think there 's any antenna scribes are with making you feel dangerous to it obviously there would be I just tuned for the minister good quick recovery um is Raquel and store with white before tool to them to the regeneration act itself you just get a memo on yet on the final submissions I can 't we do quick analysis of missions they don 't come to us so they went to Dara and Sierra consider them a jubilee provide advice to the minister I better wait we need to get these submissions we need to get big I slip into the letter was at the battery we don 't know why he didn 't see what the descend to resolve communities expect enough lift if it 's the database looking for the submission of the solution we 're looking for the submissions from the Masters have a positive remove the rear proj said there that I might be on the it came inside all day not because it wasn 't a minister my account was must see her to live beyond the DPC with time Barney chick there okay so if you could get there will be a lot of public and trust and and one why I didn 't proceed into how the independent hearings because I mean I think our efforts on the strap going to the paramount because I mean we were very clear that our objection to to the designation Ramona was that it was the impact on the UM turn out of engines of the main highway here a huge amount of work is going on there at the moment but that that bed here is just going to get I mean it will get better get fast I mean I mean I just can 't see that it 's not need to change to us does it change its designation in that regard I consider okay yeah yeah check um in a submission we supported area 3 possibly yeah sort of might be appropriate in Tiberias right but with the fertilization of erie run so we so confused just trying to understand the concern that the community is over there for it not very wise yes sir in our section we said sure any more word and shouldn 't visually business tiring yep so you need to think that it was three so much more communities as part of this process and and and when we first start engaged with spear onimous over here ago now we will still consider the work on what the infrastructure constraints were so if they be a shoot to the matter that there were these transit and then by the time we got to the e notice been put it really this year we 've done sufficient would be a clear enough position to say yes we agree it should be uplifted ok very good all right we got the urgency you can do wood smoke that weed I 'll put the motion although I faced a nice okay it 's very much transport stablishment go to the side business seeking with some discussion about the report i think is really clear and I just in some ways it depends on Aaron to protection he 'll the solute other for clinic work and I hope will work just take it back a step we as a council have agreed in school if such a committee its truest thing yelling turn is it is Andrew fit 20 PT committee it isn 't necessary achieved everything for last it 's a running cover transform okay what are we all understand there I think what 's important is it is also clear that it can be and I believe must be twisting Georgie be there are plenty of ways weekend in time set up same page authority that city runs in divorce I the term of that to the legislation around the funding of public transport hubs these pluses and in fact we must work way the other two smaller Council are we pick tool for smaller district councils to really start the starting on page before however that 's a simple that um it may have a prince prefix we 'd have for the young people about that tonight and look at penance for all together come to our infrastructure is for Environment Committee the pats around Rodin and in the northern arterial emoji wait I 've been dealt with the part around a stabilized underway we 're in we 'll start Rox vote no question that the better medical we muster and I think we 're gonna mazon that is pretty system so in the report if plea that there 's an emphasis on working collaborative and cooperatively and I think it 's what we need to do it stage some optimally I 'm happy to move via staff recommendations to be counts regulation goes and if it we make about to make the recommendation and with thee and you want to add the name there 's been a lot of info description like that 's really good and it does commit to bit me as indicated that she would have had time energy and stills to this campaign so I and I 'm also it is that all the work helping kata has done publicly working group which really isn 't as a full round with us Pauline has also agreed to app and I forward and in ensuring the last other transport working group I 'm also prepare to my name so and I think the guts to hear a greater of your names are and and Amir for doing it it 's a 12-time ops I 'll second the motion in and speaking do it just simply say that I 've a grateful for my name board for discussion because I want to signal how important public trans borders to study it seems to me that the earthquake experience that here is that was actually an opportunity to get and it 's probably a measure of Samson 's appointment that we move towards seizing the opportunity as a as a country really to to put right the situation here okay in an able us to trial device of eating people around flow of friction that it will do in its completely recovered and a match morning and agile and nimble system the thing I feel preferable then sting tu brute and being introducing up and spoke model at a time when people were already quite devastated by the earthquake and it did not following the same traditional travel patterns of study so I thought it was best to introduce quite a method change to the system that although you can statement through consultation and there was missions and here in John eyes munira Parliament I posted anything was like the Regional Council that I 'm staff members to local new Brian people could say the post changes in those areas now she found a submission that I made to City California and your planet time about how the need was fun to change be brighter not because it was a in diverse bullet it wasn 't the ears and a hub so much in terms of a central position it was it was a haven 't spoke at same time but was at the end of spoke and actually a model services terminated brighton was the league that carried on down the surprise birth the amount of image that was done in their area Jerusha that it right much smaller butter should have been us a straight away it look I two and a half years for feeder buses to be put around ellington area that was affected by the closure of the gays or overt you know there is so many different elements and I guess I know the East bit of them then then a lot of forward to the services I used to catch us under that every Friday night that I 'd get off that bus interchange so when when the businesses came to us and written and told us what the impact of having a bus interchange in the middle of a shot every push I knew that what they were telling so it happens the truth because it 's what I saw every Friday when I went into town so you know it 's um I think this times it 's been I I know that one of the counselors challenge me on the use what a particular theoretical model is actually going to do when you want young people like the one be here in the morning who won 't get on the bus because they don 't know we better count on it and have to wait for the first strike route to come on and connect up with a hub and if to get on and off buses like across the busiest roads and Christchurch to do so I just think that our system is broke and it needs a thing Tower City be leading the way not not following and hot this year so I 'm sort of putting my taking the ground by going on to a chameleon not the result I want I don 't want a joint public transport could be this controlled by the Legion and by the two small district councils I want the Christchurch City Council to lead development of the proper public transport intro public transport system that enables you know sigh close to use the buttons as well enables people to get around the city smoothly in enables people to have the freedom for one minute that the benefit is experienced by those who view the bus alone and for those who say pulling up the bus fares is the way to resolve a problem decrease patronage I would suggest that it 's probably the reverse that would be true jusef Affairs you but you make the buses be liable and way more efficient than getting in car to make the driving experience better for everyone stays empowers you make the cyclic Syrian better for everyone and it makes us travel the priority that it should be so that you can get where you 're going a lot quicker if you do those things then you 'll have an excellent system which is what those young people were told they were coming to christ church to experience so there I am gonna give up can I just ask because whenever you talk public hence what we hear about cycles on cars and buses at the risk of being Oliver will it be a commitment for this organisation to also look around I 'm absolutely so I want I want us to use all on a trip a day but it 's kyle car available for councils to use and other next week story um you know we can talk to you about a simple box or something and give it a go and but also fear it via our buses that are being developed that can run on myopia and simple systems that can run on rail and road I think that 's the solution because that would really get people moving very quickly it was a gentleman that come to one of the season and it 's putting assumption he 's got a whole lot of makin on the Volvo bus playlister the wheel go up and they can go outside from darf you or me or whatever and hop off so when it comes to crossing wheels go I just drive on the right especially quite am I come yeah I Drive is this model but anyways it performs with each edge fit and crashing and it 's been look at it I appreciate it going to happen um but as I hope happens for a very short time only and at this one this one gives he can 't resist 63 ribs in so 11 and then get into this and I 'm and why Mac Wow so the people who will pay I to the scent of the cost of this model it a third of the representation on the screw and I think it 's just wrong think the model is wrong and there is not wrong is because of the current system abs and because the government has not been sufficiently valle de public transport into the city castle we have a clear hierarchy of what is principal okay by a cast and that 's a model of what we 've a second system on we have two choices either there are more hypnosis we leave the custom where i ricky the unlit Peppa 's issues and to be elected and her lips ever for the next three years gates to control a public transport takes why I off the budget and it reduces the heavens folk model that nobody really needs to change routes that people really don 't know where to go to and so does these things all we have the particular model takes the roads and all that goes on the roads out of the council structure and puts it into a separate company in many ways that even worse we could be trying to build a community and anyway you after we have to have space that the road I don 't like the system at all and I by God for my vote against XAR fishes to go through I don 't like the fact that that for example the budget and so one for public transport infrastructure is a huge 2000s messer they get a bit represent a bigger budget and my mac public transport infrastructure 45,000 and so what we do here is I 'm make-do solution because the government will not take the move to public transport where it belongs which is the pristine Council and in we glued on committee that I make and so on and then all the decisions that affect their area nobody 's talking about taking over listen at least but i think this one just leaves so many and when things to innovate we know that if we better leader application changes in terms of the few that we use we know that people do one famous is yet they don 't know where to tell prepare that we want to have four cycles once 's all of those things I appreciate this is a major boost of Miss that we 've hardly but and that people are retailers to try and make it work appreciate it but I just think that woody iftin situation cuz we may have looked at did not come for the facility and have to say this one and it can or also said attached knife or not searching for stopping best possible solution being established encouraged which a function lies area should be administered by area longer every other aspect of what part bikes cars robes effort likes all of those things that the council controls so they have a special thing that dips forces which are so important uma see that is cysts and is stairs a reflection on the fact that we had a horrible system in place for who controls public transport and it 's so we 'll fundamental that actually the head of service model Oh competing companies providing a public service that are by the problem that the passenger transport system doesn 't work think of all the companies that run it isn 't to provide the best possible service for the passenger it 's proper as a small through a computer enduring system which is being shy and crush it to leap towards to the world so when we ate buses on the right stuff our district on wheels they get not bright etc um is it anyone knows what we actually need and we should be petitioning and asking governments and a price disaster environment even though I think it but before the earthquake that the funding model for public transport is got a city like Christchurch huge expenditure we 're going through in terms of being asked to fun hundreds of millions of dollars of transport infrastructure and asleep disaster and we still have a competitive system that actually has an able to get the bit that people they use it rather private companies making my offer so Regional Council runs however hasn 't it best for decisions and that it is fundamental power from decide to do innovative things around offering just us fears or free bus is which I think would be fantastic if you really want to merge chef we 're constrained because of all these competitive tendering things I have to ok so now I think it 's a real shame we haven 't been able to get the opportunity to build read that actually what was I think historic can crush a world-class bus system when it was actually a transport board that delivered that tosser and it was recognized I think well wrong world and it 's right now just been one of the victims that was simple videos people do whatever it was now you 've got different color buses going up and down you could the complaints that come in you 've got system is not designed its may be able to use and so we 're also interesting slightly and because go have put an extra chance be plan excuse me on odd effects in the shop without any appreciate that just there 's nothing tryna have a little bit of a greater sigh but I don 't think it goes anywhere near enough we should be actually a broken government with I think Owen reasons why we should actually have a take public addresses your test before sleep I change the funding models I thought I had a better than what we continue to do so I 'm Glenn and in turn and then I think I 'll support this is stephen future steps will naturally bring public transport crawl back and food the fold of a fully accredited or party we 've seen what happened over hub spokesmodel the fee structure into the conference if it back into the fold of a great body it is a leverage that existed just you know they little voice at the moment to go to the car the commissioners okay our control pressurize so it flips over I mean that 's what we want to do anyway bitter thing goes back not elastic it if I but I think this what we want a fully integrated system under partly and 've been being as a service industry hit that note young people who are comfortable they were on the bus etc and I don 't black as far as if there 's not a sport magnet pudding too steep and windy was unruly on a gray surface on the bus but when you 're in a competitive tendering process you can have one company that has been distant star uplift and absolutely as frontline staff to make it a piston or um or the rides etc but if the others diet join in on it then you are behind the eight ball and you will be for a while and I think through best if we can have site and the waiting 's and those contracts and that type of thing with it I think there 's awkward and it 's what got to get the understandings activists end of the day is paid service industry so for this is it just okay see time let 's do just a green out what you 're saying what you saying um don 't we 're running MSSP will appear belongs I we 're not losing anything else we 're not giving anything away there 's no pentavalent anybody else that the comparative embassage can make recommendations for us for the different territorial authorities so some very positive things in it too about how we can make future poetry sport and in fact and asks should be happen and energy-efficient and it 's very clear in the terms of reference that is what this new committee is could be depth of doing it well leading the developer whole joint were probing spy 34 I understand our little concerns of next week but I urge all councils to and support the recommendations I 'm sorry but I didn 't see you and there was those pies so um because I didn 't see you I 'm just gonna let so and nobody could please call me over the coals for free too Thanks oh and go somewhere quiet here is what did they think of a better way of their future go away she just one meter other wizards by the capital Castle party we took I mean I support it was what there I have made still clear take a date ah being appalled converse is not diminish one answered dude but we have public life from the man that we related which is a strong belief it outsourcing easter to leave the public system for time study and obviously this engagement was a my my career e food via constituents ah still whom I me if they move from hatchet then I seek to return every working day the challenges and the any morning and challenges and Lady a song that we have to work on and take responsibility for together because that 's the only way that kind of time so I just wanted to make it crystal clear it going down pathway for me is not the end of my absolute command to continue to be simple govern for a restoration of a fully functioning transport system fully integrated with all bad all responsibilities in with lions I wonder Street Council I 'm fully involved so i would actually all those in favor say aye I say no it 's care what I know I 'm the next time I are you not a stick okay to the murder of their salvation is my god you season which is report I don 't know why that repaired I would have thought it would have been just a minute but I 'll talk to the chief executive future how they support that oh and it 's been moved into ended up emotion all those in favor say aye Oh saying okay next item 43 is the request this and line of how to reference is the strategically we request the council to consider options and tips for crown counsel down an arrangement and this is simply the authorization of the work to be about 500 x star so something we end up to the chief executive of success bye-bye okay Kristin on that is that going food future just too no no this is in relation to the way that crown and the council operator the common see because we 're there is now more than one government department and we 've got the Department of Prime Minister and cabinet and a leadership the city about what Ministry of the poverty to rebuild your health or in Saxon coverage beef lens etc so low discussion below where 's the interface around life I 'm just saying they 're currently no governance formal structure the mayor council is irresponsible ministers of inheriting agencies meet so we 're asking staff is always options on Crown Counsel governance arrangements yeah can we have rights too disappointing as well agencies because we regeneration gets covered on the news the whole feature feature planet like what 's happening to the district plan view how many eyes around is our original see below no no no that 's it for this new Lisa and in the district pain review is on a sort of a different trick we have a replacement just plan it might be a place I 'm actually into this year I should I or as a place i carry next one st didn 't reach interaction in information under the school someone like to be better and drinks udders falling any discussion merchants although the place a mess and with now got even temporary spot thanks man item 50 success okay agenda 6 in it and researching free stock next one so did you want to introduce to go in and but you move now to live in PA and falling asleep that rice though love you in fact is I 'm to teach money and we supported the staff recommendations think the top banks will get more certainty for hell with Tim restore thinks they study as to how we manage any flooding and especially with the impact the tide that are breaches in philosophy part of the internet recovery okay achiever the staff playing the specifics of of the project I 'm actually I would because there is a complexity to just give clarity rounds of the options did your sister yeah it would be great hey okay I 'm just that can never fill in some other details I 'm a damn temper stop Bakst the deteriorated the topic sections lasted so they need to carry out certain item minimum level best because of the nature s res Dolan and the delays and decisions of the future where when able to for permanent thanks there 's a need to design life up to twentieth still tempering exile permanent and put there 's a lot of time for two what 's poking at those repairs is an option to see option one to provide some level of enhancement that prove levels of service I 'm raising stop banks likely to officials to that I feel that it is important that we we review and consider a little subsisted in here and we have proposed approach so with these people I really to stop title and editor I know originally planes bill leave up to tonight meters high and they 're always tended to be answering and so this practice was just carrying out a rigorous risk for us to assist their stability and range of loadings to tysons on and test just how well they might sneak over time they were found to be generally conditions able to so saying the X sections that need to be placed with business meetings if it is directly and also opportunity it keeps it Chris level 203 middle sections in little extreme for 60 needed yeah in the past VI Gators to this for the long-term solution I think the proper made it is that you 've taken a multi-headed approach rather than just one uh two well this is not not built to a say in it have to be very open about their at the cost of sweeping the base would be significant can see that moving through the debris put into this quake and they sort of that very well every time there is a clear the ground accelerations if there is certainly will become an inspection so there is a multi as it in terms of title on dayton and funny but not see the riders bar next thing to point out is he not camping delivery right let 's utilize sorry directly and thank you appreciate some repairs to the tempest off thanks from bridge street up a couple of budget one day the stop banks that are up straighter registry and in particular how we propose to do with to stop things that may be linked at the stage i am aware of some work is already to achieving i think area around it out terraced andres water still leaking through stopping there 's a your attention to take any corrective measures to linkage of these dangerous toppings say there will be some seepage to the stuffing personally below I think the surface bowling is noticed during high tides are the rain Philippines has a number of mechanisms which could be caused one could be there is a flatbed names of pipes which leaking to the sides and so it 's convincing me stopping that way so what we 'll do is we actually bear down on the station of the sub things make sure the second e36 as well and printed in part of design I will to be requesting drainage in the face as well so secret three toppings and is quite low you know think that 's caused oh the most want maze means number of a mechanism to hear this one there is a specific moment where we don 't think it 's think it 's an accessible you see from speech so we 're getting such as it do you city character going out and checking some tomorrow good ante cattleya the chief executive or supposed to some in recent weeks we 've had issues below Bradstreet which time cover that 's reportin or we can 't wear provide start bring yeah but um as its purpose are they itch is gonna come before council and its obsession we 're not perfect that all right an average appointed to the putz get stream flow fix we can discuss them at some such an occasion but I think that it was served there 's this been a report done for so so too um what we 're singing to the community groups that hit right the shirt button the area that you 're talking about where they say I 'm gonna try to track the confluence of the appetite and in neither in the weather stop banks are effective against river through that way but not the title coming up that way no there are a number of things to address in that area there will be super careful to counsel wealthy stability because you will see from the report it there 's quite a lot um with yet an area so it 's not about stopping it 's not no other oh it 's better there is word okay it just want a back data on the exchange it appreciate this before the board certifications hear all this these are pretty stop being spread the claim to static official the it 's right in water coming up from beneath the banners it to something reasons we have to look with on the ropes that surrounded oh stop things about this one tonight any grammar mechanism in them so used what again come through with the differential between the five and granules there 's potential for that turn Chris cream what a little on the other time sure in just apply this I can get on really quickly just hoarsely straight with the South New Brighton Kemp grounders is like a schematic I know you you 're not necessarily saying this weather banks will dive but just in the report all these blocks below it one though I want the residents of campground south of your brother is a plea that the sandbags a simplified not offer protection really please set up in here that is Mexican taking the coastal erosion as far as I 'm seen right 0 posts at idle foundation ok so there 's another time frame together and it 's in this protects looking at this inundation is not looking at all the little Persian issues of platform for protections of stopping which in part of the issue I want to address that whole south of forestry which is outside of what you are bringing to us today there 's a substantial issue that needs to be dressed and debated and there are a number of questions that I 'd like to write which are outside knowing that there is a strong desire to have that I can 't ask the questions in front of this forum unless a paper addresses but this paper does not very specifically anything downstream of which it is not doesn 't it doesn 't and and the trouble was a third the parties that are affected and to the issued a raisin at all downstream of bread spread know they need the protection with ability comes from the on the house is brijesh river yeah so I think that one one of the things that we probably need to us to to get that item onto this agenda and I don 't know that Richard still on the room is not that I think that a report from the stroke n review committee to counsel would bring it a shoe to the agenda it might be the way to do just because I 'm certainly can 't come as I like no come on this a deep right now because it 's not relevant to the paper you know it 's an important to and every council is aware of it so um yeah you know in a stand this significant resident show as well so it seems to me that is it because one of the one of the depth sides of the removal the chapter from a disk plan review is that there is a distinct difference between the land on the MPX Bishop allowed history side to continue though if asked the district interview support us to analyze their quest and to come back plus there 's no reason why would actually bring to to to the council table I think it 's just my third one yeah good segue though just in 6.17 where it 's in the sigma titles decreases obviously you 're one up on it but I started just the point it 's still very recent I 'll important they 're so strong Tyler but the river flooding becomes a dark force to do okay so this time is no not a fluff but enough from città runs are really high even there so we do to model the peak letterings with a hata 12 so to give donations from the media picked up artistry yannick defecated I just want to check you replaced anything i bleep area although that wasn 't there that just get very low so the area is near text close being an upper section that 's where the flood duel starts for East inspire significantly Richland design level 11 2 in looking those is with respect to me yes there 's this will be part of the food as well so I wouldn 't be able to determine it is unoccupied day today of course this is precise and that it 's looking at Whitney we provide protection which set by Victor price be stopped as a dapper 2.4 to raise the stone faced opposition and if we live nervous is it doesn 't stop ring tune and what is the first evening me but looking what will it look at our legs recanati right in terms of the numbers of people in the downstream the middle of the other people Emma Jones is quite a significant amount well in middle in the downstream that occupied Green Zone properties and there 's various for protecting in a position there no green zone probably a risk of flooding that will be of course review going through the desire to make sure we 've got that clear all right then in God 's to even par so it could simply get awake is this going to be just like you know it 's like God there is this food with only the middle section which is going to have any stuffing space so you erase the stuffings in evidence that they 're looking interested there as well I 'm to be cool the point is noticed in the road the VIN number doesn 't tuning basics so it will be addressed not and just final question I had was just a guy got to understanding like four million dollars quite all the money perhaps two responses but if you 've seen a bit we 've had from kita there 's any response to that when is going really good morning stop X dams I don 't touch it I get the full billion dollars left speaking this is for images are copied approach are these gameplay solution and what 's the con it 's my friend getting the curb so there is two priests top banks I expect of design lot of 20 years I will take to get decisions up red zone and move forward with tons of banking it 's good stuff but I mean just in terms of things like no private library and then you have give us better to go look yeah I really do think that it 's a little bit Dean pics and libraries it 's we talk to the crowd I 'm talking to them about each of the right side we 've got people that are we talking about three years yes sort of physical it is the answer you know my personal view from what I understand is that it the decisions of the funnest are facts it 's an out of work need to be done in terms of I 'm a through Road we have to do in the future future of dumb Braud with the whole lot of work done but it 's been done in a collaborative way acyl and it was matrix clearing these little expectations which we signed off the regenerate crash future terms of looking to them for so it 'll be very much a part of the regeneration of the city so in terms of the correspondent for future you know we 're at work I 'm you know I 'm quite believable if it was all I was referred to that we haven 't seen them a copy of the of the member end of every 3 councillor he said this week and it completely on the same patch we need to get these things resolved but as you all know we 're talking about sea level rise which is what the beautiful and a Dacian I do is about and we 're talking about it right with me about production modeling d2 already is that so you know your isn 't_''_5188.199 I 'm there 's no impending sense of urgency but it is something that we need to resolve and in the meantime we do need to have these temporary stop the back to the management option that had been selected by the machine by staff supported by the committee I think we do need to get it underway as quickly as we possibly can I 'm Paul just go to the question to get out to directly million-dollar you know these the views are as to if you notice any higher level suits so much mb editing boy just a glass thing is just around be a guess the probability of being a lot so yeah lower this pipe a loser nice to me is they might stop the main trouble looking how long this takes it 's going to be a number of years but it 's difficult re you permit hope it 's not going to but you know from cost-effective view that this is a time frame that we come but and pre interest off backs up to the life and work I should take that and obviously the option 3d minimalists replace the same back section now we were to leave the other students be I think feeling works and in town tokyo metro stations will need to be worked on as time progresses so rattling I guess phonemic 4 million at this point to get them simply to a state with the Magnus is this a fee do minimum often would require funds to if I more eager to get enough it may be just because we is very much dependent on the queries on farming systems com well in my other things some of the damage list of things has been through steam getting removed from white papers thinks that you 're not able to control right so the motion is a favor say aye it the public and we have a recommendation that gas kind of a teacher can revive her age and Tom her but she could sit there can be developed over a bulky cheer crushing every turn don 't get sick of such as you can reach the penis to 40 50 episodes good agenda David not that is relevant to that I can well as to the castle apology from Jay Hawkins I oh we don 't need a police name of them I mean welcome hey I 'm right so um I 'll move that ended by Kelly that motion all in favor say aye as opposed no it 's carried it will break is coming in the force _"

the issue of valuation is right if it evaluated rock then Michael flashes change that and if they will no valuation x x was appropriate but they have been some portals that happened to appropriate make their car painting unfair then the pro provide their VIP look at me ask next remove need consider whether there 's identifiable group of properties that we can satisfactorily give and relief do without create an unhealthy president to other properties that have not divided district and beta what it is like separate issue about Earth the mail set aside most familiar with that one but that that might be in it since we 're produce varies greatly and the other one wasn 't an if mistake is that that second one has not been faded quickly enough availed iron are in the right responsibility flesh be correct that I wasn 't Rivera towards which does I am Not sure I know can i buy produced and I just seduced by Robert because obviously one agrees that is the Spireites in for a real huge there are properties yes that 's just the moma dicted by this as I instead the district stuff sorry interest is not quite truth by there being rated at industrial their rate effect on the value the value at the time was sidered to be very much higher than a standard rule if used just very rough numbers if a standard rule raucous a thirty dollars per square meter for land no problem we say 200 Ott 's per square meter these property values in between so there 's debris a speculative mark okay maybe a hundred as per square meter sort of light caused of the strong signal that their zoning would change relative listo now what happened or sleep after that is for some of them that edition was reversed and it signaled that change wouldn 't let fitted value disappear so I 'm just wondering if their resolution website special rate Chris start to provide port on postal rates relation or more appropriate river valuations because obviously please can 't_''_361.15 be used for industrial they shouldn 't be zoned truly valued and properties as f1 November 2013 so really matters is what the value was then this has to change is thought of if Ruiz bone ruler as metal in between we can 't change it so so mighty Joe more appropriate evaluation complete you are and with the day class the only way around there 's a rates permission and the skate well the report will be is the valuation right there Britain and the process in terms of you and that valuated IV on which I think have been gone through but you know included before what we can okay saying though is the valuation right if it is with their subsequent things that have changed the cake asleep but maybe it 's useful to consider it thank you be admitted i SAT a watch my bike and ask is fake but just in terms of this so it 's beer unpossible rate Commission or more appropriate vibration I think it 's possible this was cabos yes okay right are you okay with it yeah no fine i just love to be very clear that that 's QB have it and ended up with all it agree on the middle out she was wrong yeah admit it was wrong notion to combat okay okay so everybody okay these resolutions right the move breath is equipped at me i think everybody 's very pathetic for the today 's cases and watch the fire around just not all of the stresses as also calling on the people involved so as a possibly get a time frame when something can come back just because i think it 's really important what 's reasonable state Oh okay and yeah one month you 're not involved in any other issues at the moment um on each other guess dime figure about what a variety of it I can I have some drive to supply with God bleeped interested interim live in charge any rights dingle days I have been we made in your purse to UM rates holiday to someone just and the interview in the trip know where we can raise it those tanks we 've got attached that X and collective and and if people do not pay good for the penalties on this instance whether there 's any penalties of payment I athlete advised to tell the residence aspects at the moment to avoid those papers always get even more you do steve is so they I don 't promote just a good city staff period of two months yeah with amongst yeah you can do it so busy quick special thing okay with intense so what is it write a report with an nuts okay with Jamie put their vote in favor clip say those post you pop that though skip the spaghetti oh I don 't know if this is going off topic but we obviously do these valuations if three is the next technique this year I 'm on a ranger counselor between aliens months but no we would wobble it yeah awesome so that was I fought in and think whatever passed an infinite binary item 15 dismiss no pass no play Prince nothing so I really cannot move Jenny

that consistency alignment of regulation forces between local authority controlled areas and crap mean a desirable the current legislation from that 's freedom can unless the lies restricted or breakfast so I think that that 's kind of in a nutshell captured all the issues that have been raised and like to thank didn 't hit the dough should probably take off as well quickly just let 's grab round-tripping me that you tested on graph you actually to the people that have been involved in it and you kiss with their match the reality of reporting be a reasonable position this be awesome thank you yeah lot the noise look around using that so many loosen for rock falls exactly sorry um day oh this is a reservation conference to positive offered their morning break to do it just like the focus on perhaps four or 5a and a question first to colleen really centers around an issue of sourcing and staff with forcing an ability that 's always been a great philosophy of mine there we can have a lot of bylaws but unless we have the capacity to enforce them one of the devlins and two we 're now in a situation where we are potentially asking us to do a huge amount of work in the short period of time and we have results all we have a capacity to give our cafeteria extra capacity to do the trick and the short term and secondly we are we results absolutely if not can we ensure that we are ability to effectively enforce these bottles want with an eight of them attitude of Kristen big isn 't in the article work I mean for our happiness with other big what the volunteer and what we I just assisting us forget because in terms of the enforcement and recovery of infringement fees there 's been an issue throughout South Islands as i sell i got i am a little cheating here and one of the that came up on crystal was exactly that that they could set a fine on but they were racial rental vans so that would take leave the country without having via and front of you and the people companies haven 't been I think for come in terms of their legal ability to actually hold a credit powder map paid such fees at the event I 've traveled internationally and hit a rental car and it 's precisely what they do take that a thousand dollars a credit card that 's available to pay fines that you who at the time that you are hiring their car that doesn 't seem to be happening here but I wasn 't aware before vary based on that we will raise the central government as well because the enforcement of that it doesn 't it be managed and dope nationally but in one of wheel clamping because we 'll pamper need you to pay to get the chance for on the right I agree with your toilet on that bed French but my foot really was that you know we create revivals we regularly in huge numbers of resort consents that have conditions to be endorsing an Air Force Minh team are increasingly required to to look at enforcement over not only bottles but resource consents and other statutory things that we 've read in oak as a council so I think you know there is that the issue of not only the resorting required to do the sig to work but the ongoing reporting this required to maintain a adequate and appropriate little of force not only was i was but was always contained conditions everything we are increasingly they 're working council pre-war more work into Erin for something I 'm not sure the resourcing is that matching the ink basin below are under pressure I kind of hope this would be the debate and other than the questions of is the debate I thought I was a question of executive initially this work I 'm hearing that way or a prioritized prioritization of work rather than providing extra resource to to do the work and eat don 't always go but is why we spot the review on 220 chick this is debate yeah move into debate now we 're neighbors nice to Christmas verification resolution on on the resolutions okay I 'm just on the one crazy advice that there couldn 't be a very cross yourself Duncan turn across I 've known bank across this today yes I think you 've changed it now you 've tea and in any duty free clothes divide I can we just get an explanation as to the change for across and then side across the side until we 've got one changed apart from changing or to end nope there was a was a resolution that no no Annie number one never came we were only looking from three downloads the numbers the numbers been changed back to your budget ok ok so one that we put on the screen head across the entire banks minutes of war and there was a 's completely gone yeah and powers at the chief executive it 's got the number one is it exactly same as in a council agenda no it 's not exactly the same I just see that we can boot and to all in or tag or implement a new temporary closure we paint it to and implement any new template I just and does that basically to get our to Bennett and other ears are respected current or if I could not be corrected sites that i can take a by the borrower or any other area would finish it comes up yeah if it 's not a health and safety requirements so she can implement enclosure under existing by the awful suit reason council yeah i need so i opened up the debate clean thank you the committee obviously and the social consequences of freedom candy by themself in turn on all cultures and i think we may have underestimated the the effects they we 've also found that we wanted a full review because then it 's turn it on so containers of contain with provision of the for whip on this italy and sinfully you talk to Marcus point around can 't_''_650.369 I which studies some great 30 divided ears open to that we can party more imp you the four mirrors the council now still esteem PE she worked a lot on this promoting this with government at the time so I can see a lot of opportunities to join up with ministers and ain 't get onto that and also by the pool together an on-set contained in if you like they were an injury-time thank you I 'm on please be this resolutions in front of us today I am certainly at kesslers do so for them so they stand I am have been very concerned obviously I look through my eyes until he was happening on the peninsula that he believed in very concerned around the problems that we had last summer despite the viola been put in place and on the first december two thousand of plane clearly there was some effects of beta camping that we hadn 't anticipated would be so great and where we could spur that initial vital saw that summer settle quickly i think is it good and keeping the closure of the the unsightly closed in place i think is is very wise given problems we had a tow site into a low for a full review of I law before those sites are considered for reopening in what the shape of all I accept me except a full review and a threat and are writable review will take time new staff rising as gonna take on in 2017 and that certainly needs to be taken as the case and in that context please we 've been able to look at a partial review prior to their avoid any ships that otherwise would have good particularly in regard to not a self-contained free of canvas over the 2016-17 start season I was particularly concerned about a proliferation of non self content freedom popping on deck spinning spur we 're already seeing some issues at a lab dial yvonnes by and maybe two smaller extent a little lower I think we 've seen stack did you identify what next year top spots might have been and are take place before the rest of d member so that we can have them viable place by L or the you partially reviewed by law or imply prefers to sepa 2016 will be able to address those issues so I think what we 've got it front of us here something that technically workable that 's ever able to deliver on in a really good way but also respond to the issue that we 're in the deputation this morning and concerns that have been expressed around tables at once again biog catalyst to UM to support what we got in front of us now turned in hey David so so refrigerator this is on staff contenders there 's k here because freedom camping it 's not free it 's costing right Pat 's bison both and lots of amenities with regards to the using our zilla 's beyond what they were actually designed for and free climb a bit of limited time to put an example example thing example it but also got an edict in again with a different part of the community to the community felt a good facility right throughout the city council area and nothing 's stopping anyone doing day trips but when it comes to non definitely these are the body out a local businesses those getting better and fit and therefore everybody I don 't_''_876.379 I don 't see why they that not only expensive they 're great facilities and the mother you there more that can be done no facilitate and I think it 's a really positive and wife orbital gas to that 's I think you for sport oh yeah thank you I think this is a start but I think it needs to be some sort of notion here although I thought she wanted best suggestions from the butte asians was that we do set up a wireless networking party or task force working with immunity over the solutions as well and I think it 's a really important element so I 'm although it 's not a formal resolution like this to someone it can be picked up on I think really this guy 's I mean I know we 've heard from staff that the Vice has New Zealand around the world and I oh that wall will be reflective of the increase but i also think they releasing around the original Bible which was to director only had a few faces and I was interesting to reflect on them were you very something and and that those common is made at the time of the Bible the problem can be activated if you restrict it more have a few places or to go and I think that 's an hit inherently one of the lessons that we should also consider as we move forward CS actually we can put someone on the rental days but if you look at the statistics that 's the proper vehicles that are overwhelmingly than not contained on 17 so I welcome looking at the enforcement and recovery of infringement please but I think that it has to be in conjunction with the private sale the prime motive ables not just looking at the real car companies um and fundamentally like this is impor find a little question around what we 're trying to achieve as a speed and there really or are you only interested in attracting people pay lots of money to be here and in Blair and personally I think we should be aiming to be an inclusive City and we should be looking for solutions and looking at areas where people of all means of income can come in and enjoy and celebrate and enjoy the good things that we have as a real you know I think there 's still need to do above all for thinking about the future of freedom campaigns city weather and I hope that we do actually want yet people coming to us three we do want young people experiencing and visiting and interesting enough you know that millions of dollars has been thrown into a new tourism campaign encouraging road trips around the stuff up so you know let 's think about actually the bigger message that we 're going to get up and I 've been met with some of these um you know free campers or from I 've been to some of the hot spots and there is a real master locally people travelers visitors and also there 's a basic human right and we should always make sure that people have access to so big you to the staff and the council but for these new resolutions I think it 's the good stuff but it 's still a lot of work but next to be done to find a Ford Focus solution David thank you look just like the support this and its entirety and just reinforce my beer comes around enforcement no point in having while or that we can 't do for some properly and spindly I would really like to enforce item six ticularly and I think it 's absolutely imperative that we have a joint up strategy that works around the South Island there 's no point in having regulations and produce different regulations and sell one and they down on a realistic again so we need to be signaling a message to to freedom campus these regulations that apply it would be fair greater ever joined up approach and we can achieve by from six I think upon a huge way to getting a job and up approach to hear country so I will be supporting the most simple I I think of excellent weave and biological pretty much agreement in the servite and I want to do that you 're thinking stuff because I know at the time when during of summer ask alice to sort of us and respond and no one had participated the whole way of person especially way of freedom papers and as I 've notice compounded by the numbers of compound by the social media and creating a hot these the hot spots I think we do want to be were welcoming to all of their visitors including a ministry young people as many of them and hopefully will return to our country but there is it had to be managed well and there is a usually and variably a price to pay and unfortunately at the time people attend the local people either I really bad that the that the action workshop chief executive taken as address in there and what their will cancel narrow taking there 's no question there and we have to look at ways of matching camping facilities which being Kara to you from staff that in the review there 's potential to have them energy options which and which hopefully will be much more workable and involved today okay oh that 's a touch up with regards to I agree with business we do didn 't he demands a problem and essentially no because I and how educated air now writers began thinking coming here and having these facilities for free and all of the chef 's weapons when something free having people repeated the relation i did a freaking can be prefer two Christmases no aunt Dorcas loud and facilities 6,000 IM not right and it 's not expensive everything is a 44 in 180 toys she managed to get over here biggest either right so I set country an offer what we also diagnose we become a default gimping an operator allowing free having a pub and a sponsor our public use regularly and of course what 's done is it get us enter the ability for a commercial part of a camera operators that if you do this do you make decent income so what which scene makes of primitives but actual fact we should get in the way of commercial operations by giving this is a default next up for freedom canvas for nothing da makes it really pleased to see some trolls going to baste looking at home we can actually control it right across our things will be important so if once it 'll also gets back ash applies right across the region which is really important especially coming into the coming tourism boom that she started us now we heard it down we had a daughter stick here with a pop into the country and if we want to manage it with love texting controls now and do it properly well I put them open that 's it oh oh they know carry much advice and do threesome before starting the gospel cheers thanks anyway see ya as a doctor saving yeah Spencer I though obviously bacon note that i can find a presentation of traditions through no petition to present my 55 or something could

    "text": "I think 30 please as it 's a recommendation from being regulations and consents fuzzy and Tim cheers on it I 'm just going to say up to fifth well if tempted to introduce the report and then and then i 'll look for a mover and a sector and we can have some discussion and people can raise any question is that you know that they wanted anymore the debate done thankfully i 'm very splitter i 'm staff came and looked in order to do a partial view as a committee thought you might as well be saw her to get onto the issue so we moved it we would rely on Colleen 's and powers to put on a typically wherever required but both we had that tall we will ask for full of you offered giving bottles there 's better than that show not as simple and great you might have a mainland story yeah so your meanness though I 've got that as an amendment which reflects need to do something about self-contained situation on banks peninsula people killed it only crash it City Council chief executive powers under the act or by law yes only relates to City Council configured area yeah that 's understood there are some areas of the conservation land that wouldn 't be covered by this for example and other privately owned areas and so on I 'd like to move that amendment to solve the plumbing so well may well be an upcoming problem over the X sub season in the context that we 're working on the bylaw in that time I 'd also like to respond to the first of the deputations by including further amend that it 's all of the accused in dr. go Sphinx point one on his paper he 's handed out yeah thats a the full review of the full review of the bile or to include and then all of the bullet points that Chris has given us so did dozens of national level work with the regional level all of those ones do three four bullet points tweeted last slide probably accessible and there were two for sure a further amendment that if my amendment number 3 does not carry bottle all be completed by the first of December 2016 and appropriate resource committed to the work well what are they came to explore initially is whether we can actually get an A Grave motion because it is no need to have a separate about what I 'm trying to achieve is that we don 't go into mr. summer with non self contained freedom camping about anywhere banks peninsula except where we specifically restricted it as the restrictions down moment to make you happy port for you to be a mover of an expanded resolution in for Andrew to be the second to put a 20 year for my counselors because it 's not just being furniture there was no show the other area so up theory there 's a motor warden educated but i would like to eat another outlet to see I mean we 've got around the East restituere it was the norm contained it are you chew yeah and maybe I 'm so my purpose in putting it forward just for banks peninsula is because that the area that I 'm familiar with and those to I 'm suggesting take it across the hall cesium would before that point award early I want Andrew to the other side Spratly so it amounted to jump up quility and I just want to bought it what planes it makes absolute sense what doesn 't make sense does the ending what is around us so i think andrew might need a little bit of help for the benefit of getting something that works here and may I just suggested before we commence we probably need to get the substantive speaking third and what Andrew has said I don 't think anyone at large will be humanely opposed to what 's been Juicin because quite logical pregnant I not have heard me say when I fiend that we were going to see if we can agree resolution look to what you need to do is you go back to the second for the substantive you don 't actually have to tell me what to do and what does beat what I see it was can we get in a great solution so that no needs to move in amendment is if I am suggesting I thought if we can get to that point and Walters will leave the the word must do that because we have come time time again with passing resolutions where the wording has been sufficiently accurate plenty of time to get the bird and resolved between now and when we actually move seeking to resolution and get it debated but I 'm getting a sense that there is general agreement around table 2 heck heck that work done and the meantime we 'll take questions on the on the issues that are contained in the report and and then we 'll work on and in the main aren 't people work on the detail of the ring has anyone got any questions for staff and relation to the report that I don 't don 't have any questions of stuff I probably want to foreshadow further I mean in that we have this problem and again it 's another issue where central government here give me the problem to territorial authority to deal with and I thought I heard Andrew save the whole that back to work with the council 's LGA initial or you to review the freedom cash so i just need to expose night when we get to it I will inform people about the response that I 've had from South item is I 've reasonable I haven 't_''_413.209 got responses formal yet but I 'm getting a very clear picture of the exception of this isn 't the two that is really a national issue so it is a central government actually because we have to only create a Bible and the context of the lips of our framework that allows us to do so and it is not an effective mechanism for dealing with the issue certainly it 's a paramount that we are aligned across the country release the South Island I started with the south on it but we put a local government using on conference coming up and I 'm absolutely positive we will have a Rhema almost measure strangely enough actually have a question for start so getting back to business what is the reality and thank you for your staff of the way down a believer what how realistic is it that we could get a fully done prior to the summer season because this uber or along those lines the advice that we had from the strategic planning and it was that it it wouldn 't be feasible they 're going to hold review done with next summer which is why Leah riginal recommendation we partial with you so we could address what we saw as being the key problem which are the non some complaint vehicles it 's specifically a lot times the five detective sighs so I understanding from team is is that to do a full review of the bylaw in the time scale that we have available we wouldn 't let certainly get most effective reviewing that we possibly could so what would be the timeline that you would need to achieve what we want the full of you ought to Ruth brought up early and the regulation contest committee that she believed that the B 'nai 2017 was a more appropriate I 'm line to be working to in order to get off review and I fell in the review what inmobi otakon time given the time to choose of us being able to manage the freedom can give camping issues given that we would also like to government not sure obey my sister 's for the review also include some practical and possibilities it 's pal council might including Kim like for example including using some castle lane as a special areas for freedom camping at end which might include some payment food I got Kimber 's nose is it as it possible well that within the remote we are able to receive some practical options to manage these issues if a full review conducted they 're basically opportunities that could actually be explored so in terms of I know that there are a number of individuals who are already looking exploring low-cost coming important something within the teams and the terrain for camping is mod SE feed becomes payable hit log is really coming is a fear of donation in whatever way that forms but there are certainly opportunities or cancel to explore or not they wish to actually manage another commitment and learning to manage options be that different fee structures etc for existing campus as well so those are the things that if a full review takes place could actually be route thanks guiana idly really in the position where all of the sweep has already been done so it 's not the really starting from Ground Zero we 've already done a lot of the weavers deserve this assay it shorts a substantive review I can 't believe that it can 't_''_678.519 be done given that other councils have developed perhaps more fitted possums for resolving that stove and one of the vials that I 've got a back home the victory in the border area that is she worked in collaboration with doc so that the rules are the same they 're identical so and by creating an environment where was the same counsel controlled areas and lockers that actually a Jeep perfect outcome problem exists with the fact that bottle the freedom camping bylaws of the Spain and all of them are in force so if you 've got neighboring Island as it 's wise to do kill us to think my career and being MC from turned on ruin you all of the other parts of the whole of the South Island of us visit might actually notice the border in that cross at one region to another or part of the area is the requirements are some terms of what we need to be satisfied of make vile or we 'd be evidence of the issues in our area and issues and one a beer different me ever you 're just suggests to me that the eight there is this fundamentally flawed I agree so all agree that the actors fundamental flaws do I think it are the the number one element of this is working work sync with other capsules the LGA a jeans editors and take a reference to central government sorry because obviously the government review the freedom camping it and yes all right number four people we we 've got c to c into for that the council undertake it fallen through a review of bylaws I am hinged and then then but can you whip some people back you doing we didn 't write what area before Angie the edges and the minus shows nonce second title change their to all effects pressure from all things were not sure to or the cottage the council area here is there a database it slips liquids um can you change the wedding of the last one I don 't know that statement but just um I don 't know that Asian in relation to the Fallen Carrick review of the bubble that 's for printing what ok maestoso ultimately so maybe number five and say implement a what have you got a temporary implement an extension to the temporary closure to include a prohibition on all non self contained so can I just make a comment on that because the Bible gives the power to the chief executive to visit every closure and its executive 5 i 'm twisted itself chain not sold out size and much um so the previous Committee 's recommendation was to replace chief executive to use a temporary closure I lion my advice is a tip to the chief executive um in respect of a total prohibition of non self contained beyond pepper powder positive FL off that effectively is Steve into the streets of the Council of Iowa magnified ever have a self-contained I 'm being sunshine that 's got the the routine is to deal with issues if they arrive need particular sure which is why the committee 's original recommendation is as I believe the correct pigmentation angel at the chief executive will take very full get to the final wording of all of us because i 'd like to get reading f so if the right but it 's very odd that a question thank you i 'm not surprised at that legal address that was the question that was about to act in fact because there 's no point in passed my resolution which then the legal mice to the chief exclusive is not that to allow that resolutions of you perform so that buildings me to my next question which it 's really further drill down into how possible is to get a full review of by Lauren despite the first of December because if we 're not able to get a blanket um restriction has decided then at really speak do we need to do something before the start of next summer season though eyes we got be looking into the simple situation possibly worse we 've had this year so if we were to put extra resources or to prioritize the review of the bylaw and certainly given the commenced memos just few minutes ago about the value of work that we 've done on this already before we arrived at the original title I I really would encourage that we we consider whether we actually could be possible with appropriate resourcing to get this done by the first to December it may not be a question that in front of us can ask but the tide connector set but I I really need to to know that we we could do that we put all resources into exactly so the question really is anyway but we can resource our scale to get that or review done the first December there 's a question can ask but I not have Rachel probably think maybe by Matt but to be safe my media done availability of counselors for hearings saying that so ending the cost of Christmas period so I don 't know we do you see anything sports or if he throws official is also yeah 3 about whether we can do this legally I 'm just wondering in terms of five approaching on all non set to contain freedom camping Manus tenure was an effect under the Lee County we could only actually have that prohibition on land was owned by counsel that 's what I 16 it 's what me music yeah like a nuclear war canoe or we get no no that 's why i asked question at the beginning because i didn 't want anyone left with fury that we could exceed that it beyond our own yeah thank you think you just we 're developing a multi-pronged approach with government in terms of counsel titude i have a appt taupe provision through the finals on non silk I think there are the council 's that have a been on not contain camping there or district every they 've pierced by themselves as a tests yeah the teacher in need to wonder if you heard of any of the wit that needs to be done going this week what they done to investigate without yeah that 's it any challenges to those councils with it neither have I think it could be challenged it 's not just through judicial review that through some be challenging challenging infringement notice but I haven 't_''_1194.309 we have believed it easy isn 't you will a challenge to buy the relation to a profession in relation to opium Kim that affected self contains weapons ok but not on just not eat just relation himself could we do a two-step process some impaired with an hour so that the first it breezer focused solely on non self contained are you so that would be a partial review um a little further than the staffing original traffic me was there is potential potentially to do the initial initial review and a time frame that we would require for a typically implemented by the beginning of staff on the snots of Kentucky obstetric yeah and then would we continue with full review still by my ease to achieve is that we solve immediate is do it for the beginning of the next time a season and we resolve the wider issue as soon as possible but anticipating that that will take on because it would do projects over the pizza we 've done on changing the wording of number five to say um undertake an agent reviews oh the rules relating to non-self pain freedom camping to be implemented by the beginning of next summer yes ok play around with the wedding and get right out Johnny thank you so one was just around the bylaw making provision I think was a climber who 's the freedom kicking it is it 's a problem but my mind setting as many to do those cookies a bottle around whether some perspective why you no problem with the bottles too much appropriate and professional I am addressing miss April is that does that come from a friend camping AG or is that from the local girl that 's from the local government so it 's always attached so that we make sure that we measure every single bottle the second question Walter he 'd like before we made the bylaw we didn 't seem to have this girl of the top of that we 've got so we kind of jumped to a conclusion that the solution is having further restrictions but I 'm just trying to understand what the basis of that is given that before we had the bylaw in the restrictions we didn 't have anywhere near the scale problem that we 've got I couldn 't find in the report any kind of analysis of that but we got a kind of any reasons why alum yeah hosts file we 've got such a significant problems then they do when we do what we 've seen is the flat of the last increasing tourism birds that have come to the country the show being filled by others including look at that just elsewhere in the world detective sometimes six quality and it 's reflected in the numbers that we 've spent about the commercial providers forever to children increases big barrel since the portion of the report England where people are usually those are we 've got increasing tourism numbers and increasing tourism the people who are looking to trouble costs it off Dylan being prompted us being a freedom combination I 'm also got those people who are looking to work Luna kikuchi is possible and other issues that surround for all of the authorities but across the country the issues are a non self contained private deals but it is driven by differentiation Austin and a huge increase the number of people seeking to come what is unfortunate coincidence that oh there 's two things it 's gonna be no media look cause trouble it 's almost ended up maybe but the fitful and the question was not in the monitoring you make well over say things that I guess problems around facilities McMahon shoes technical issues just a number of thing I kind of maintenance level but there 's nothing really delicious so can you just tell me out a lot resolution services I know the one Anthony with footpath example where the maintenance and fixing this body is cleaning up post the keygen 52 people maybe display for the other 're doing in that regard so given we had the all these problems how will you saying these areas they did at the huge of r2p absolutely I feel it really embody don 't stick to the party as Victor those places to go through the normal process or remediation and damage whatever they do the tutor that of thing I find out those sites are fortunately use that a relatively common across part so it 's question of them going for much money they basically preparing replace this facility so that 's because looking at the point sympathies that potential seeking to actually replacing just like to sing or something resolution to actually go work at the area at the spots that were did suffer quite a lot through they might be forgotten full rebuilding well step now oh but and lightly got like bullets out of action part can I just leave but you 've got drops at it rocklands over the flowing everywhere I mean all just of it p nothing like that give some more explanation I just want something I don 't win today national the kitchen open box fun would be their ticket a welcome addition we undertake the full view of the final istanbul original aha security can tell how the comets may of that year per hour with earlier of the city 's busiest time attack and also Fox from under self-contained so campy the issue I 'm content with all of this before we bill exact same you know and all regular traditional one I casula AC AC people CTO public take another shortcut we can take the post is my vision well the Pasha will the phone be able to buy some require special procedure so and we need to follow these steps to analyze evidence and present them to the castle and proposals for a menace to the bylaw based on leave innocent to the decency to 11 of the bubble from both partially reviewed as well when it happened with SP from now on here some poor schooler maybe I 'm here male next year the extinction of every closure you mean this the chief executives for her decision about the temporary closure I mean it happen also gonna follow with you I mean yes I haven 't got a full time frame but I could give you this time that it would take all that have you take the purpose of this report was at leap to then go forward to actually look at that presenting information in order from appropriate experts especially determine how long exactly thank you would be nice I will attain that we had before that we could convert that partial review for next summer but the full review would take longer if we have that possible review yet we do have the opportunity is be mentioned to address then also contained issue before that time but it will take a bit longer to do gather all the information pathology a day out and then pool sorry I 'm not sure we 've got for a no no they 're still working on the water is a lot of we 're gonna have an agreement we don 't have an achievement and getting right to be just we just that 's not good produce but we 'll get there Oh pick up young t be picked up yes action yeah I think with this bucket the chief executive for follow up on it but it 's just a report back on the areas that we were made available in terms that impede on the structure single questions because otherwise i 'll just of it yeah i just looked those to pick one what were you looking at a total ban cross surf not sell Kias cross expand into a on my sure that no just brush it on a halt is it also yeah we 've got to rip the book waiting ass i 'm just going to take a good start clarification and we say we 're looking to LGA in other th to get a national approach to it cimarex beautiful pasta like why would we even pursue a bottle it would not be required thing with it because that would require absolute confidence that we can get a little change between our an example so we will need a suitable holding be traditional back position jenna jenna and we 'll be back and ten minutes in strictly timnath right _"

    "text": "no to comport behalf of campground owner Don little nap also speaking to my 30 more min is very much for your time and allowing me to come pick you all I want you along I think they start fridge farm pretty much nailed it on the hit their presentation is a little bit left of all I one I 've just got some words so introduce myself Marcus for a little campground wait wait thanks furniture if you don 't know we are also represent up thanks Peninsula privately-owned campgrounds but it 's the echo I 'll topped in my new confirm hostel oh so canes Bay which is council-run money by speakers very small business I president and member of the indeed mca which is the caravan Association so thanks again for letting me come and speak so on a few things please remember that accountants that are able to manage the freedom campaign through the Bible which adds the purpose of protecting area protecting the health and safety of the people who visit their area and protecting access to area the are ways around restricting it so reason I recommended a full consultation there 's the initial drops in compassion to the one place now wasn 't really done sufficiently there there was no talk or there was a general consensus that banning of non self containing vehicles throughout Christchurch and on beds Peninsula in particular was very strong in all submissions that wasn 't really taken into town I was talking to account but it 's still a lot I think it was generally poorly carried out example Indian Rihanna wind consultants additionally at all so what messages is that a formal working party or interest group or task force whatever you call it has formed involving Council and other stakeholders so like the NZ dmca can be tourism dot petzl epen and accommodation providers so we really know today I think with the problem lifetime is consulted a minute to have a a good grasp of situation on banks particular so that helps I always in a willingness impressive nature of your staff the time frames which are looking at the option is to have a forward you buy in place by december this year believe other reasons is it deep yeah the exponential is the city 's premium tourist attraction one of them in his field of our mutual and cultural significance therefore needs to be protected they might be valid reasons to an african king of it in the city for short-term workers but the Miss Lee visitor attraction and we 'd like that the trek and encourage visitors that can afford to be there so other reason for the health and safety fire protection one great danger of having a cheap freedom campus especially on pelicula again does the fire risk in particular smuggling which does happen with um George dippers and that sort of thing so I am there will be a fire started operating campus on the side and this has the potential of being spiritually disastrous for the study for the landowners and for the environment these sites are down front I was a good i distributed from contamination emphasis safety of visitor there with the self-contained system it is easy to comply with sorry we need is a bucket and a when you lead a container of water there is to be a bit and he and hopefully with a most you should sit out the fastest with people from the east a bit here that isn 't the knowledge of self containment getting so hard so people are I to pop down trying to cheat us so there 's a few questions why can 't you be a viable there let 's papist freedom camp but we touch can visitors so for example you if you pay right you get a little thick of it is can camp dedicated a free or whatever but okay right what we want to do is take as much money of tourists as possible I 've as for where we 're here is it then there 's probably more reliable source of income in our dairy farming so I 'm run through a distance but unpretentious you could appreciate a camp fee system but the doc asks for certain not so physically and used by the community pay for monitoring and facility so it 's probably used by that committee fundraisers for community argues and so forth so again I am come up with as we believe it needs to be treated differently they 're never the city so if you want to have freedom campers and people can 't forward to say they can say a designated area every bone there is freedom camping for the base peninsula situation in is a bar mentally sensitive area that is restricted or bad for visitors maybe not local so I 'm hoping that versity CPI the solutions a recent problem that is only going to get worse but never they 're not physics but it can lose together the option of the total bandwidth a small fee payable but keep a protection and enhancement so if you allow food and caffeine you could say sure you can stay here free I do um but you 've got to stay you can play five dollars for dark either seized or so there may be a legal way around saying you can safely but you pay for the showers in the toilet so give the money to hyper those facilities because it comes down I think will authorize that from Philly bet you you late payers a little bit peaked at least the inmates have been used to subsidize a small minority to stay for free everyone is to pay rent normally rent or mortgages and why are these late pays more dumb people subsidizing the small or not this more and that is to over 100 keepers at times editing closed for so this is I suppose it the moment what council has done but the problem from city in going back we 've sorted out these the Gnostic contain there is a problem over to spell under script i 'm not sure i 'm working with them in regard to that as well so queen steph this foot can have an effective system why can 't can 't breathe and I just like to UM bring it that the ideas of having community involved with more time I got suppose not self-governance but I 'm management of the ear is in days so for example in the flow and parts management board a small fire that part management board collects the feed their pays for a loaf of my balloons for that let 's look at a system I think rift investigating all over the peninsula and there are these small isolated communities and someone to come over india rubber band dr. secare to come from critics of being mature to eat a few rubs model is not the best economic so to give you that example the monitoring that happened this year it cost over 80,000 for a part time in 20 hours a week person too haha to come and have a look at the various spots so that breaks down over that took hours a week for months it breaks down to twenty thousand dollars a month five thousand dollars a week that 's two hundred and fifty dollars an hour the guard to monitor the whole drive they have exponential our twice 's which is at least two hours preble five hundred dollars for the just to drive from here overdue free time and go it 's 40 campers here took a box driver so what we 're time is the boy employee locals they 're trained locals there be used and look honoring wardens and I just so that there is that possibility and the community more involved in this way that it also encourages visitors to be I suppose welcomed by the community by the area that Aaron they 're going to meet locals they 're going to live in a little bit more about history and culture whereas if you have places like French fire and water small part they 'll all pop up there they get to make a few locals and food are doing is thank you for free and it 's a bit of a game that the more money that they can save the more that they can speak and they go to Thailand or Australian any questions I know that otherworldly come to the door perfect perfect timing Marcus oh thank you very much for your presentation and i 'm going to move straight on to the artemis so you 're welcome to remain for the debate on it okay thank you _"

decided amongst themselves they would come and make a vantage of the five minutes public forum to make a presentation also can i welcome all the student from the book and install and i particularly welcome enjoyed wire and katie structure to table thank you know my name is Katie Scott yeah this is Josiah we are 50 of journalism students I think Dylan broadcasting school you see thank you bleeding I speak to you today about some issues with either place since moving to Christchurch frosties or some of the class a large majority of their lives and we 'll be talking today we flee about our experiences with cottage metros listen an issue student space and nightlife in Christchurch geneticist effects obsessions so before moving to Christchurch and I so we perform this and test it user-friendly ownership public transport system certainly this is not what a lot of us have collapse and back every day and a frequently be faced with uncomfortable situations these include a bus packed to the brim of high school students and still traffic and rickety road or being in front of a people that have put our safety and the safety of others at risk the stiffest received here is not where 430 lat solid week tears go at their due to the lack of student fear to give it a whole a couple of weeks ago a girl in a class was on a bus the airport at three pm the bus is packed with school students variant ages and the jury lasted around 15 minutes a couple on board were having an argument for a large majority of the time involving aggressive language english tools faster and directly to one another the school on the bus partly involved with frightened by the paper they had a choice about to search unless it was table there 's only example of the sort of situations we 've been exposed to and not the only group affected more frequently they 're not people in wheelchairs or 's provide on some of the vehicles it is important to recognize some of the newer professors do provide the appropriate and an aspect of by the pram wheelchair but this certainly this is just the new abutters with a little benefit people using wheelchairs or perhaps to live nowhere are scheduled bass will provide the appropriate for them we also believe assessing the wac and bus travel to deal with unsafe situations and creating a solution aside from these items would also be very beneficial providing been effective public transport system and Crouch is equally achievable it 's been done across the globe at places like frankfurt and a port and yes im Welling leading the way with the economical trolley system it provides users with free Wi-Fi internet on set off cards game after you click this is given the opportunity to build systems like the metro and with the system becoming less and less popular among users it 's time to rebuild this key factor within our city hello that Katie mentioned my name is John I 'll be discussing the nighttime in Christchurch some tattoos face dealt with or improved after the earthquake in 2011 than a Christchurch that he took a huge hit if you 've quite can 't have it then I 'm sure than going to town in Christchurch would match the Otago wellington and auckland student experience i want to quickly mention that we are not promoting the village drinking culture and christchurch want to encourage us a four or five and excited cub for these young adults to spend their thursday friday and saturday nights having a main hub with a selection of clubs bars to go to would be ideal on a thursday night there are only two clubs available off the dress street and on a saturday night usually just also necessary for anyone who wants to move between the bars on either of these nights especially with talk to air to people around news hubs recent research into a spot six texts and robberies and pop this is found that the area and the intro city including say s of street was one of the highest rates for the attacks and all of Canterbury the violent attacks and to why people tend to either stay in one place or not go out of them end of here at the foundry University bar while it 's doing very well at the moment simply miles I the city center so you can only release idea it 'd be fantastic to scare monitored up for these venues in our city center to provide young adults with a robot and safe environment to drink just break it both our points with the other bus system in Christchurch is not looked up to its full potential it 'd be great to see this change it changed as it affects a lot of art of our community and it won 't take much to get the ball rolling on this false we stay in the bus and I think such a diverse range of people he can 't stress enough just how much this to improve our city the nightlife in Christchurch of something that would mainly affect the youth of the city and we notice certain councils trying to find ways to make Christchurch a student 's number one choice study and it to Christ into something that has been ongoing since the quakes and I hardly friends and have a great time without feeling unsafe or what we need thank you for the song very much but I mean the places that you put ahead formats it so I 'm going to a narrow and a couple of minutes does not see this term Phil yeah that 's gotta freshen your studying at stickers so you 'll be very bright so what are your thoughts with regards to against putting out the bowl thing for the other prices of the bus it because of let you use the theory behind what it pleases me I 'm affect us prices up would probably really unrealistic for load students get to school I know Susie 22 and 18 you go from playing I think fifteen dollars a week 23 miles away and that 's already on top of have to pay living costs and everything else in their students we don 't have time to work and earn for extra money to pay it just really positive migrations around the public to are not we don 't run buses we provide the infrastructure the question really is around running the busts of it like dummies but it 's currently the bottle is what happens poke tomorrow okay so SP on that on the floor its people are required to change from combust and I 'm just wondering hell you think that might affect young people using a bus ah I think in some species of our people off catching the bus I first moved here I 'm from Wellington and it was I was really really scared to catch the bus when I knew that I had to change buses it was really off-putting and I mean you don 't have to pay each other which there isn 't really an issue with that but it is kind of a student you 're getting in your own two different areas you know don 't know them very well it 's quite doing having their get off on bus wait for another opposite right passes yea big just coming that is this is very timely for us is we were an agenda item about having things you 've asked us to do in a clearly an input thank you my question why actually over the house and spoke just your views on with a lot of working that sounds like yeah and I yeah don 't think I 'm with you on me Sonia Oh understand to the dirty night you know you talked about the bus transport system and the issues was going out night to perhaps around safely have you given it an inspiration to what needs to happen so you feel safe oh the surveillance on the buses and the improvers yeah posture artyzine and drives could be treated a little bit bigger they 've there I 'm a really nice up down right roof and they 're not very I don 't know the weirdest but like people walking with alcohol that 's just happened on Sunday guy walked up the bullet he was drinking it wouldn 't do anything they 're pretty vulnerable to us just get all upset really high standard that we that we 're looking for other areas any mention around moving from what venues yeah killing um yeah like an can improve that just I 'm having few more I said I talked about or a baby and it 's more bars on the street or I just find more security could help with that too I was limping up there and I like tonight we have a bust for students that can pack them back to the halls that could be an option and like at night with see you know you 're at a hall which is a good Fatima drive all the way away from the city and normally hit a pay per se or a nice a driver we could kind of pull the sternum answer which seems to be free as well stata three electric bus running around the cvd I think with you know where it came to see that register station at some point and you know probably the timers there 's come sooner rather than later yeah oh thank you very much I 'm great that you were able to take the opportunity and really appreciate you doing so hopefully i 'll spare you the big sections dad about this Dean Wilson smothers to speak on the ocean port recovery plan update Wilson sorry given you an extra smoke a teacher oh I know why because I replace your name of Paula but they can create a crease anymore thanks for stayin okay and ultimately papers of this deputation this morning as to support prescriptive statement over t2 City Council from lv station I 'm he 'll be back yesterday the ball was recently break by LPC of the afters I 'd for damn here babe which seat to standard 60 prefer cover I be spiced mx2 the more fun Tampa Bay and what the hall was happy our most assess the content of the design guidelines Weaver and very disappointed by that make a really involved by the community the board is conceding that and the process may not make it was going to hit dinner then p beso babe fix to consume in but also like to talk abscess both mean better suited as a little of you leoma like I was born here and about we will disconnect between the community and Paul campaign I I also really see it about when the office was it like the stuff the other area nice when the committee field was put out for trading the communication community in the campaign and look coming he 's dialed we put CA of different people that come in to where I booty feelings yet consultation over the vp of a pain have you just point of themselves they see what does it mean and a potential little Chum the cake is in the oven they 're really struggling to manage um you know Caitlin going and also these real must fast to whether a picture gonna even here come because there 's a big promised to the community and the past that have never eventuated so we hit the extremist little tonight really our way to be at half dozen lose money gone the beach I think we hit people just really consumed it was effective equity in damn hair to engage with poor company and from community and so and who can 't even say but probably pork on the corner of a London substrate which have again official distrust of what Elvis leading and the global warming 's about all people think that 's a lovely time to be able to exist of all the fun to meet again the really is about staple even people down because of the whole Norwich player show it was the American that usually straight so I 'm bored lot of ways to engage more with directly with port campaign in Dallas for painting we were and brace also by the port liaison committee which the suitor and many years ago and go to the port noise we Came suggested that my big idea that the pebble point on that committee is another way to engage am but I thought it difficult to and I mean I 'm within and energy when people want some real answer there was hitting report you know stoned Ethan and I mean I can only tell them what I know and I do think there needs to be a lot more the well for people just a delay getting that poor can play and typical of ring and what they 're saying especially and cific to you and come hey we 'll be on our stage for and funding measure projects along with us a little Chum end Laurie minimal inch and um why that paper felt like that the poor wretch hearing about the community by funding that these two different groups of me indian to try out of you various and like all my patients have gone to put captain a full funding basic try and get to the people that talk about it doesn 't know like Mia I just feel of a lot anybody I so can really and the disappointments are death and the lack of community engagement also I think communication you know I don 't have a seat and I thought drovers feet a lot of people do ask we City Council and all of us as owners of pork on each side of it sorry but as a Christian portal asked why they 're not drinking worst accounts are not directing before young other areas felt like I just need to express it because I don 't hear a lot like an irritation so these holiness and I relevant to save reluctance from port itself no I understand I our business in the beach make money and that 's I know my lifetime that I 've lived a little tonight week on upfront at one stage Roth who sleeps told containing same direction I waved hitch to the don 't have launched a guy and I thought we were saved and because the touch the screen to specify that it 's just like these barriers put up everywhere you know the singing whales in the invisible ones I just think that I don 't know it 'd be nice to see some sort of adventure some we had to try or some sort of facilitation as you can start giving some relatable stand formed because i must say i love you all I can I have never experienced the speech and all of the end and i think that 's it down because of very austere support I 've fought in the community I when I yeah so basically and you know the reason for the secret action and really as to those appointments to cancel today and it 's gonna be a long process and I think or another what 's that addiction was probably not really relevant at and a like of sports crayons in yachting sanitizer neat and these big fish platter with a war what 's us because of the risk system spin down into the connector purchase Michelin and two bonds but there 's all these amounts of things people understand you know the institutional to figure out and these just at the moment a lot of confusion Aria and the community a heating is a result of port recovery I think that and it 's an incredibly powerful point because communication is absolutely call critical to working together on the recovery of the whole of little Turner that although it 's a little bit port cover e21 stint as the recovery of the whole of the little area I still live this off this thing 's you will play with with great interest Andrew did you a question or a comment that you want to take because I 'm just mindful of coming to the end of the time which is yeah calls but I can do any context about when we get there right I don 't know if you prefer yeah no that 's fine that 's fine thank you very much and it 's it 's very important that we hear from the community important this respect for the sake of the understanding of the report when we get to it but I don 't think there is anyone around this table that is disagree with the distance which is that you can 't have a recovery excellent the community and community can 't have a recovery absolute goes to keep the hand in here okay so the next deputation is in relation to item 30 occupation of the freedom kingpins by Lord 2015 at the 2015-16 season and I 'd like to invite first press Gold spoon to represent the French farm community oh and Angie oh sorry somebody came along across your name off my life so now you 're back on just Porter it 's fine is but welcome both of you right well good i 'm gonna stop Christoph 's links on a permanent resident as you will be aware a French balm residents recently participated with pride City Council in an active experiment in a how to better manage freedom camping in use them and I think many lessons to be learned all sides and what we want to talk you about is what would think some of those key lessons have been and as a result of having learned what we have what we think needs to happen forward and we would like you to take the issue on our behalf and on the affected communities um some familiar any photographs of what 's on on in and variety of sites is for photographs of what 's happening at free time during the peak of this season you can see very large not suitable camp very close to a road that zone 70 Plymouth now if there 's one thing that I 'd like to keep clear your mind it is that as a site mass capping this side is distinctly im sue toilet block you can just use a little cream blob in the face along the streetscape there that toilet box can 't this is just a road reserve it 's fairly narrow people have choice but the camp very close to the road and they accumulate in the numbers that we saw here upwards of 50 in a knife drive heart they 're usually really describe your head under how that 's possible and you see that we were confronting some quite serious a health and safety issues as well as issues of adverts visual impact our impact on the environment now the experiment was really a result of the introduction of the new bylaws but what we 've experienced diminished farm was not a direct result of those bylaw tourists arguably exacerbated a little bit by them but you can see here these are people all over the years and a big dramatic change that evident there is the shift from sort of contain being the dominant form of freedom camping to non self-contained and you can see that it was already starting to rise quite dramatically before the by laws were made this is a statement made by accident I might you to use different analogies but the there was a serious adverse impact on the visual amenity of this area now given that it 's that visual amenity that most people are coming to enjoy then that issue both from a tourism management point of view other court it also had a direct and material impact and an ongoing impact on local residences what am i clear because the media hasn 't always been helpful in that regard that as a community we do not see this is the problem resulting from the nature of the demographics of the people that are just in this form of tourism this is a problem that arises from set expectations and scale I 've chosen that photograph two women had walking to work down towards the shore are taking their breakfast dishes and lives in the state the photograph was taken after the first of March once we knew that there had been a serious discharge of I 'm treated effluent into that me about 50 meters from where they 're walking but before the end when the was closed and at the time that that was a leak and who camp in there as to the disk that was involved average two young women a-and called after them immediately started talking about how they had a speckle pattern weren 't going to you soaps and detergents in the sea they were wanting to be the right those people were environmentally aware and I hate work you know thinking though we 're doing the right thing and my concern of course is what the sea with milady be going to do to them what they were going to did said and they were so much shocked when I paint them the situation had occurred there and the risk they were expressing themselves to as a part of our learning the lessons from participating in this experiment initially the individuals were responding to counsel making sure that the instruction was aware of the issues as we saw we found that rather effective and that we did meet as a group twenty people gathered to share experiences and reflect on what we thought was going on and what he done about there were 15 or unable to attend because there are a and so I went spoke with them face-to-face for a email exchange within canvas believe use in India especially provided to the community board was supported by 28 residents five more agreed with the need to affect greater control and on to disagree so I was pretty happy with level of agreement we were able to achieve as a community about an issue is quite contentious now it 's teachers for a number of reasons but I want to share with you because they stick to be the sorts of patents regularly occurred when we engage people around this issue the first honest and interesting me of a snack with Amy Adams to be around this issue and he said pretty much this is what happened began as well the freedom camping was seen as a part of the way New Zealanders leave life it 's been a freedom that we 've enjoyed for many years and that 's where the community bands well it was as I began there was a concern well hold on this I keep doing it now should we really be trying to all this cut into though was that that was actually a non argument what we 're dealing that now is not the same phenomenon as the okey o scale fused freedom camping that many of us have actually exploded in over the years this is a new phenomenon that there was a result of a master and we floated it wasn 't there was really going back as Zealand continues to promote tourism it 's going to have to learn how to deal with a different type of phenomenon the insight that he gave us though was that in any ways the freedom capping act was founded on false press it was try to manage a phenomenon that doesn 't exist anymore and fail we think to add fully anticipate the challenges are now unfold as we move and try and do this new phenomena in surviving at the canal is it will be okay with all the numbers I think one of the key learnings and I think the council of ministers are we got agree with it to Felix came from implementation of the Bible was actually not and is people French pump or numbers of for for 40 cars sorry would see more lightly some of those that you saw nearly four graphs unwisely if residents went down Aaron to suggested but may know where that man was unsafe moved on within 10 minutes someone would occupy that spot in people from caps came along and did the same thing again it 's like a highly dynamic animal is continually adapting and because of the pressure on the site it was just pretty much impossible to actually get meaningful control over they 're also issued to farming so you could have someone around and move people on but after dark when there was nobody there there was a great deal of creative interpretation of the restrictions and people camping out of the area set up so that we cannot legally control at a reasonable cost this phenomenon using our tools over an area of the size of banks peninsula so it could be quite a different set of challenges within the urban context but with nary a lot makes to need peninsula this is very difficult thing to deal spying recruit that it 's broken out in one area the pressure just built another the hotspots move around and there 's nothing good in the as to scope of the freedom an act that allows us to put in place perfect controls around there for that reason that we think and you 'll see later that we support a full review of the bottle and a reason we argue for a full review that some of the issues of need come to terms with you don 't take National Coordination they 're not going to be able to install at a local and those variations and reaching agreement with other parties is going to take time and that County people actually a third bottle argument we see this coming up in debate within the media on a regular basis they 're available for the economy and we should build a fleet indeed the public meeting the positive devotion representatives of the freedom camper community were arguing for their value to the community and fishing is very point the point would like make it up that is that this is know industry level criteria for assessing what 's the return what 's the bang for buck on this market segment it looks let Rosie the reason that they bring a reasonable amount to the economy is because they can stay longer notice honey a little today there is a contribution what we think the French farm experience shows though is that that with cost and distinctive characteristic of this particular group of tourists is that they demand services and are the same services that were basically built for small populations that populate our country towns tariffs easy so part of the toilet French fun fail fail because it was designed to service far far fewer people then came to be using it but that scaled least I 'm speechless because well we know we have problems with in a Corral problems with what catchment the waste management issues with ongoing saw it has yet ever an effective solution nuit as well issues a waste management there in on the agenda your agenda for a long time and it to does yet an effective solution so it 's being a base pressure from large volume people who a day-to-day basis were actually spending relatively little so in effect the community so we 've gone over Tigers me if he could be through the the eat these communities effectively subsidizing this too and we saw that empathic form in the favor of the toilet facilities to quite the top here now quite that was given to me five days before we in community discovered the disaster that was unfolding at the head of the harbor there so inform your own conclusions about why that statement have been made but it was manifestly false he was the reality of the situation blue light is the amount of effluent that was being taken out of that facility non-ghosts you can barely see it on the scale because it comprised 5,000 litres our estimate based on the water flowing through that facility because it wasn 't me to put on that but was the discharge into the ipod of the order of 700 800 thousand litters our season alone now the gap between those two ions is arguably the abyss into which perfect of administration separate yeah list of what we would like to be done you want to up the last page because I think that might be quite useful just full of others don 't have ocean front of them just to see what the community is asking for so we urge you to what about capsules the elec bubble Association national government to review the French the frequent gaping at we think that that 's not giving you the cool do you need to be able to be fit control and primarily they could have be unless prescribed applause that is a part of that really that means that this activity can will like Pete the cat gets out of there a highly diffused phenomena that is a fish effectively impossible to manning and so we put that you Amy Adams I 'm just on board we think that is to be disputed with some of it in the vial or a break of Ephesus was put on the distinction between self-contained and non self contained we think there are some serious issues about the viability of that distinction and unless the 's unwise to be placing so much importance on that within the vital process start yet we 're asking you really to take a full view in the meantime extend the existing restrictions on the past hot spots like to extend that to include a best finish your water restriction on non self in mind until the new bottle or had been put in place thank you so I did want you to put up that slide because I think fish you know there 'll be others sitting on the room it won 't see that as a multi-layered approach that you 're recommending from working with the council 's over New Zealand to review the freedom camping actors you know that at the political level and in our own bottles and in a temperature but I particularly wanted you to have base decisions on suitability of area freedom camping based on evidence cheers been ground truthing tested again by virgin knowledge because I really think that that 's some up for me and I wanted their kind of on the record so thank you very much we are going deputation and that will enable you to stay for the debate on the rule thank you thank you very much and clarify _"

    "text": "no um after a lot of hard work behind the scenes and thank you to the staff who helped make this happen and the proposal is now to something note the update the request and agreeing match that amount present community center and residents association make us official on the raft annual plan which we can takes us to be but then agrees to make an additional loan of up to four hundred and twenty eight thousand interest-free for five years of no fear the funding is secured by the 30th of June so that gives a fullback position notes that the decision to grant an interest-free loan is contrary to the community loan policy but it does we are enabled to do that as long as we declare that it 's an unconcerned consistency is due to the unusual circumstances relating to the gap and funding due to insurance coverage and the group 's need to prove the process process the project progress process progress and then agree that the council project manager continue to support the association to ensure that the project is successful is delivered in a this issue to help develop a process which will help ensure that council does not receive last-minute requests such as listen my future so if it gives us a bit of background in terms of that yes I do and it really relates to some ambiguity in point for presumably what we 're doing is agreeing to make an additional loan of up to four hundred and twenty eight thousand and that if no further funding secured by 30th the June then that loan the interest free for five years the grounds of the loan isn 't conditional on if no further funding is secured by 30th of June so if we put a full stop after four hundred and twenty eight thousand and added the words this alone to be I think that makes it clear that I 'm assuming that that 's our intention to wrap the loan they won 't need to borrow the money if we give them the money Andrew so we 're not it 's not a question of making the loan granting the loan now and then assuming we put the money on the day just know that lemon is there if they need it but the money won 't be they won 't receive the money until the first of july in any event and because i understood that our intention was to make the money available now and then it would contour on the first of july yeah that 's it so the intent is that the loan will not be available and unless the group of acquire it after the theatres of june and so they won 't require if some other funding is as granted or found so they 're not getting the loan and lease they don 't get into funder so the loan won 't be available until the first of july under low will only be available in the event that annual plan funding isn 't made available the loan loan requires provide security to allow them to get into a contract that 's what long as they 're for does that not then mean that the loan should be made available now though they don 't need to slow down don 't just know it that business point as surety of the contract so again with the good yet other community group behind us actually happy with the solutions so the community group has a meeting in May listen yep um well I 'll take the two counts that it 's come to my suite okay we 'll finish the bios nice people I think this is another question do that um well I 'm seeing sort of emergency so I was happy to move and I 've luck speak to it as well animoves at four seconds did you have a question oh yes please yeah just over how kind of water type number four is because in essence the council broadly is still guaranteeing funding actually prior to the adoption of an airplane we 're making a complete with a precision we 're gonna make going along they 're sort of people making a loan about hey all right and then my other questions doesn 't the still set a precedent for any other group yeah I mean you sure does but that 's why number um 8 is there because I don right all right so yah knee cool um thank you um just we don 't stand enough nearly in this chamber thanks that 's good it 's good from a health and safety point of view um so I mean look thank you for staff working with the group come up with a solution it 's maybe not the most elegant way of doing things but actually to meet us is really important this is a community that was really hard by the earthquake when the community board received the first report until the loss of facilities across the city what came out was the Hagley pyramid board had lost a very large percentage of its community facilities and you know on top of that you had a lot of destruction and often overlooked that Mount Pleasant I think something like a third of the housing has to be rebuilt on the hill maybe more it 's one significant the damage and the stress that people are under and despite all of that this community group has tried to work with the council and with the community to return their in which the community what has supported and now they 're working on the permanent and I 'm mindful of remembering the comment that was made by the RSA in regards to the bridge of remembrance just recently and that was actually although they weren 't happy to start with that the bridge had taken so long they reassured and in hindsight I think believe that it was great that we actually built the long-term give a lasting solution rather than simply rushing in and fixing it straight away and I thought that was quite powerful statement that sometimes it 's better to do things once and do them properly rather than have to come back time and time again to add on into folks and dare I mention new Regent Street so I think this is really exciting and I know it 's been a lot of hard work but I would like to encourage cancers to support this group and these resolutions because I think certainly we do have a moral obligation around dealing with the undervaluation of the insurance for replacement and I personally don 't think similar situation but if they are then I have no problem providing the support that we can to deal with those those issues that arose through no fault of the group and no fault of the community but simply because the amount that we had for insurance was not enough to replace the facility post-earthquake so I urge you to support this resolution favorably I think this is a really positive step forward for a community that has had to deal with a lot of suffering and stress and it would certainly be welcome in terms of the assistance oh I want to repeat some of the stuff that my colleague has mentioned but what I would say is it I 'm actually confident we 're going to get a unanimous decision around this table tonight as this resolution on su certain obviously because why because post-earthquake we 've actually a lot of us a fan of sales in positions we didn 't find ourselves and before the earthquake and one of those is as a landowner and a property owner I 'm having to rebuild and go through insurance to what you actually also found is actually that property owners have now found themselves wearing the shoes of a developer which is quite a big step for all the community group here is actually found themselves in the shoes of being a developer and they are difficult issues to wear and they learn things along their process as we have through this process film is going to get and the things that we do as a council so well I know this commute community groove put a lot of effort above the sea I know how much stress they 're under and if you 've ever build a home with civilization of your formal this morning you build at home and you 've come across an issue the stress is quite significant because you have your largest asset and if you 've got loans against it asset that does place a lot of pressure on your so again I 'm certain you 're all going to support this here today I also want to thank the community group for the effort put in to a sector of our community and I also want to thank the council staff and Lee in particular for the work you 've been doing with this community group here and there she held and resolve some of your issues and maybe if we had a lead butcher there at the beginning we might not of that she found ourselves here today so again from Kuala 42 that universe decision of today and I want to thank you all for your support thanks so much yeah up for this antenna against it 2.8 which is the real concern here as we got this at the last minute and it 's absolutely no fault of the group 's but I I want to make sure that we as a council somehow get a process where we have more leads or whatever it is because we cannot just keep going on on estimates and suddenly get surprises we just cannot do that it 's been five years we 've been through all of us we should at least have some form of process that will prevent this I do darica and Linda you 've done an amazing commend you for it but that doesn 't excuse us from having a process I support you but also I 'm sure that we don 't end up in this process again I 'm Pauline and ears thanks Tim following on from there i 'm wondering if we want to strengthen 8y perhaps putting some wording in there that speaks to walking alongside community groups whether it 's this one or another weekly what we want them i added that he thought we were worried it was not exactly what we want or if you here we need to absolutely work with communities we can 't abandon them to do things on their own when they 're doing things and I you know I wanted to speak of it on this myself but I know but I don 't want anyone to just continue to debate something that 's going to happen it 's yeah and it 's also once this facility and others are operational they 're on our land but they run by community groups that we continue that wrap around service for them particularly when things go we need to keep them up here so thank you great so can you can you um in front of the word process right wrap around because it is a wreck around yeah that 's cool so that we 're integrally connected at every level it 's the same with the Illinois community seem to exactly the same you know we want to have a partnership arrangement year but then they have to apply for contestable funding for the people to work there and it 's just it 's not so we 've actually got to have a wraparound process that we is it a referent Indian precious well the grant process it covers I started to cry that 's not a real life NJ and it 's good that we 're having this particular debate because there have been a number of examples and we 're really pleased to see them where community groups working in parish Ansel and delivering the MC facilities that traditionally might have been provided by council the governor 's Bay Jesse repair would be one example of this our annuities another edgware pool will will see more examples of where communities are working very closely in partnership with council to develop community facilities that are actually owned by the communities and we we have an activity management plan that that encourages exactly this kind of thing where communities step up to take ownership and management of community facilities so having ways of working that support that is exactly what we need to be doing we 're doing things in quite a new and different way and community groups are doing things in quite a new and different way and we just need to make sure that we 've got good processes to support some community groups so that we arrived at really good quality outcomes because I think it 's absolutely great that we 've got a community group in Mount Pleasant that have stepped up to do this that have spent all of that time as volunteers that have gone way above and beyond what anybody would expect to deliver what I 'm sure will be an absolutely fantastic facility and I 'm really pleased that we 've been able to work through in the short term the medium to amend the long term so I 'll be very pissed as a purpose today um actually would then maybe taking on board but everyone said that last the last word and number eight and sort of does not receive last-minute requests such as this and the futures maybe is not surprised by last-minute request by yeah yeah so no no no don 't don 't read not even that 's already there just why don 't we actually say so that council can work better with community oh yeah yeah I 'm going to which will help ensure that council the rip recovers it yeah it 's a good ground process but it 's not surprised by last know it 's kind of it it 's it 's the literacy time for preparation that 's the issue so I think that 's that 's captured as a little bit better than then sort of Steve what you want yeah yeah I think that yeah that very clear all right so i will put that motion all those in favor say aye or as you right I _"

clarification over with them with other bluetooth is pointless no no we have to move a motion to be public excluded but I know but just to the question are we and we do Hey ladies asking are we in the blue today so we 're doing this we 're doing this another I guess yeah yeah so um obviously you know since we have the presentation this morning there 's been a little bit of discussion behind the scenes to see if we can get to a situation where we enable this project to to proceed I think that 's the general impression that I 've got from people who who have been intimately involved in the discussion on it we 've got some suggested recommendations but not sure Jason did you want to sort of speak just to the to the financial issues in relation to this recommendation and I don 't know confirming that that is the deadest the extent of their under insurance I wasn 't going to respond to any insurance questions whatsoever just more from a from a financial sense yeah because we help if we had the resolutions up there better to see um look council was hamstrung at the moment I guess financially yeah we 've got an annual plan which we 're currently out the submission and so the preferred option was to go through the annual plan process listening to the community group of course this semester around timing what we were proposing was still go through the annual plan submission process there is the preferred option but to agree to defer the repayment of the interest in principle for the community line until the annual plan is adopted and so that delays any time pressure for the community group to get figured up and finished right okay ended this look this is inconsistent with the kingly line scheme which we have a four point five percent rate of return so notes5 and sexy to spear to say this is inconsistent but as long as an opportunity to to resolve the issue in terms of the draft annual plane so it gives us the opportunity of doing that but in the meantime provides them with the sort of financial security so that they can proceed potentially there 's there 's a debate around how long the community loners to food for which councillors wave well when if we defeat it for 12 months in would that would that kind of give people the you know there shortly I mean in terms of the dollars and cents how much per month is are we talking about I think it was fifteen hundred dollars yeah per month is the servicing a bit so that would be a minor effect a minor effect on council and in terms of the Council budget I mean it 's certainly a lot of money but it 's a minor effect in terms of the overall budget okay um look I 've got lots of people that with their hands up so that 's it okay I 'll go pull Yanni end and drew and Vicky can we just agree if we the four hundred twenty-five thousand dollars to the community group to finish these works do we have the ability to do that and what are the complications around proposing to do this to answer bit odd need to know where it was coming from the kept on bellman is committed the council is forecasting a surplus this financial year which thing goes into the opening balance for the rates for the following year so the lower rates number of my percent proposed at the moment is partly due to the surplus we have this year so if we would fund it this year there would be immediate rates and pet and in the 1617 annual plan of between point A and point one more thing but we could actually really do that I don 't believe so Diane you might better help on there but at the moment we have known identified funding source for this though that that 's the issue so we 're trying to come up with solutions that might work and better at the moment without going through the MU plan process I don 't know that any of course council can do you know whatever it likes or the reason but there will be a rating effect that needs to be considered that will fall into the 16 17 year but wouldn 't it fall there anyway if we 're going to put it into the annual plan your next year it 's what reach but we can 't_''_329.8 I mean I think that what we 're trying to do is to stay within the parameters that we have set ourselves in terms of how we 're handling that anything I mean yeah it 's this is why I don 't like taking resolutions off the floor of the council meeting when we haven 't got a report that identifies these where the money 's coming from how it 's being resolved etc etc well you know that might look like it 's an odd way to behave but actually I think its requirements of the local government aid to actually identify your your sources of funding I don 't want to make a decision around a rating impact without the proper analysis of it will be some trade-offs and there will be trade-offs in the process as we already know in terms of the work that 's already been done on the capital program so it seems to me that if we can find an immediate solution that actually takes the pressure off the organization and I would have thought not having to pay interest on principle a spate spelt al not le thank you and if we could typo yesterday I oh it 's a oh it 's short for its principal some it 's a an age of singular it 's not a noun and so I think that that it seems to me that the issue here is can we can we give the community group the assurance that it needs to get on with the job of from you know building the facility and and giving things up and running but at the same time undertake to look at the grant that they 've requested in the terms of their annual plan and that gives us the opportunity to do it in the context of everything else because something has have to you have to get a balance and I 'd rather give them the the guarantee that we 're going to consider it in the context of the annual plan there is a commitment here around the table as people can hear and if we can defer the repayment of the interest in the principal in the meantime it gives them the assurance that they need to carry on so thatthat 's sorry doesn 't actually give them the money this than your plan place but it 's an immigrant process which is 22 within two months it 's within eight weeks it 's not very far away it 's the end of June we just sign off on the annual plan I mean the timing of this is as terrible I don 't know how the you know and we do need to do a review of this whole process about how we got to a situation that within two days we have to make a decision that there 's something wrong with the process that led to this biggs unpack that i still think that part of and that 's what makes me want to really look for a solution but to give the community the opportunity to get this up and running without having to repay interest and principal for for a period of time i would have thought that what that would enable them to proceed knowing that we were going to resolve this in the context of the annual plan yani thank you so currently minus thing is we have money on budget around after building master plans for this corridor in this current financial year is it correct I 'm not aware of that hard to answer on the fly okay so i mean i 'm basically looking at like the current capital program we 've got 1.6 million in folfiri right so this is operational family so the issue i guess its capital to the group that council need to fund it as operational funding because we don 't_''_583.01 I guess I in the building right okay um so I mean I guess from me like it just seemed that if we 've got money on budget this year that we 're and we 've heard that part of the cost oldest works is actually to enhance the immunity of not just the community center but McCormick 's Bay you know the playground the car park that that seems a very kind of sensible solution so there 's money on budget not being spent proposed to be carried forward that is actually a runner I mean all of that has been allocated in terms of the budget that we 're considering as part of the annual plays wrong but I 'm just not going to you know you can sit there and say it 's did easy that we can just take money that 's allocated to this purpose and a splendid on something else it doesn 't work like that so that 's enough okay inside the second question that I have is the difference between now and we was originally considered as we now have our global insurance settlement so surely the money that was part of that settlement can be allocated towards the purpose for which we received it oh sorry the dog will cease mean that 's the 's up to us to us right now we will allocate the money yes we are not going to allocate a component of the global settlement at this meeting today okay so but just in terms of the payment decision around but I 'm enjoy this way previously what we 've done with our facilities was we 'd said you 've got 1.4 million that 's what you insured for and we did a statement of position with our insurer and they said yes we agree to 1.4 and that money was seen as the muddy going into the rebuild or the repair that facility because we 've now done the global settlement we now a ball as a council to make two individual calls around facilities around what 's needed I know I 'm sorry but I 'm gonna meet you but only because you put your hand up I 'm gonna let you respond to you 've been answered do what I know I know I know but for the purpose of what saved just which is the bootable Ferb mr. Johansson putting aside there but not wasn facility has been paid to mark pleasant so whereas the rest of the council got 60 something percent since in the dollar the smaller see CTOs that were all the smaller entities that were being insured on von count you know by council on their behalf were paid out of 400 sense so they 've already had all of the money that and more to under the global setting sorry but it doesn 't make sense late and some are for example we only had insurance of a million dollars we 've just committed 10 million dollars to that project so we have actually used money from the global settlement to meet the shortfall of the undervaluation of what it would work aust to replace their assets we are not negotiating is a global settlement and how it 's going to be spent here and thank you and I 've got a number of questions and they refer to wear will out rather than where we 've been it 's fair to say two issues that arise from the report so under option 3 the impact on rating referred to on the rating of option three option three is funding it the impact on rates of the 303 thousand level is point zero eight percent it only four hundred twenty-eight thousand it is point one one percent on rates and that would have effect in the 16 17 year-old okay great now if we pass the resolution that 's proposed here okay does that allow the Civil presumably that doesn 't allow the Civil Works to proceed until after the 30th June in as much as assuming that the annual plan process results in the 440,000 been addicts budget at that time that 's the point at which the funds are available for those civil works to proceed am I correct in making that assumption I can 't answer that it could be that the community chooses to proceed on the assumption that there may be funded through council or if they may not yeah I mean that really drives to the house of my next question what we 're doing here is presuming an outcome of the annual plan debate and I 'm aware that under the local government open mind and I 'm concerned that what we 're doing here is potentially passing a resolution that makes an assumption that we will make that further decision you could almost say binds us to that decision for today 's decision actually to really work how do we sit in terms of that because you know I 'd be very concerned if I was in community group that today 's decision wouldn 't give me the confidence to proceed because I 'd been an environment where the council may in fact not make the subsequent decision it 's a way that today 's resolution anticipates and so there 's a process issue there that concerns me it 's certainly the recommendation of their option or recommendation 3 option one is to defer it to the in your plan process so we would be whether decision would be made so given that that may mean that the Civil Works cannot be completed until after the 30th June when there is that level of certainty what effect is there on the construction contract which we know is is a timing risk and under this resolution that the community group could end up deciding not to draw down the loan because of the uncertainty or could draw down the loan with no way of actually completing the project and therefore we end up in a very unusual situation where the low has been drawn down for a project which are unable to be completed and we end up having to potentially defer the interest on an ongoing basis or otherwise see the community group in an unsustainable position that 's a question I cannot okay I mean that really cuts to the house of my concerns I think thank you could I ask a question please over a process where we 're noting a contrary to the section 80 of the LJ does this open the door so if I all set a precedent of other groups come in in any given year prior to the annual plan process of submissions and hearings couldn 't this be used as a precedent if money 's granted today I believe it does I mean I 'm aware of other entities that would also like top make application through the annual plan process so that can be considered as the mayor said in June along with everything else and and as you would be aware counselor from previous and your plan discussions sometimes things are deferred and there 's a balancing in order to achieve what what 's required and I under the council could of its own won 't quite money and give it to a group but actually is they also risk in terms of the LGA requirements about consultation I have to defer to my legal expert 0 we are in the annual plan process we were going out for consultation and your to approach that with an open mind in terms of everything that comes towards you this group has been invited to make an application under the annual plan no decision a final decision on that can be made until you get to the end of that process can I just understand the implications of that for the community group they have two days within which they had to sign a contract why would any community group as a group of or three hundred and three thousand when they had no certainty around it I mean effectively we put the kibosh on the Mount Pleasant Community Center don 't we by delaying it to be an you can I can 't answer that on behalf of the group but all I 'm saying is what if that 's our process that we 're obliged to follow under the Act whether the group can negotiate it through the deferral of the contract they have to sign I don 't know but in terms of our responsibilities under the air status the process can I just clarify also readers that is a contractual issue i read it as having to see this the line what I know know there 's a contract that they have designed by the 30s I stroll down let 's look at a point they 're going to finish the program off they need to draw around the rest of the line and because my concern basically is if you if you look at the reservation will got up there and I think counselor Turner sort of alluded saying draw down the line is enough to complete the building and even that puts them in the position that they can 't actually use the building until the civil works are done and there is no certainty in that that that civil works and perfect we 're actually pre determining in this this here which means i 'd rather not go into enter the annual plan with a predetermined condition i 'd rather go let 's just cut to the chase let 's fund this thing there and make the determination to the island I 'm the man wat scarification pull the form I don 't despair is resource consent so that they can know that the resource consent isn 't that uh sure anymore no it 's not that it 's not the shape can I just clarify from Bunyan point I 'm assuming that why do they have students theory makes all of its decisions in relation to the 10-year plan and the annual winter circle that 's given the nature of councils there will always be things that come out them and I 'm assuming that the aspects of the of the plan and this financial year such that if we make the call that some of our operational surplice goes to this that is legally possible I don 't we don 't we don 't know this is not a community facilitating we own legal access if there are two more notice to that one is really major is there so that one can just make decisions that are inconsistent with their policies my concern about this one though it would be that you let the information to actually make a decision along signs that you 're suggesting and I think that 's come through from what jason has see so what information will link I don 't fit what i get from staff is that we don 't have the money at the moment it 's all alligator well what I got from staff was that there is an operational surface Kevin anywhere they have faked it into yes mixed years and you 'll play understand that but whether we spend it allocate it now or in July one if we 'd be allocated on pay for it because that 's the only way that we can definitely do that now I don 't want to do that I want to actually look at this in the context of all of the things that we have on budget in terms of the annual plan there is no money just sitting there and a bucket waiting to be allocated for this purpose so this that 's the work that we need to do in the context of their annual plan actually I still do not understand why we have got this within two days of a decision needing to be made that 's the thing that I find incredibly frustrating it 's the point that Ian 's making now making arguing a decision without having the authority of the advice that we need in order to allocate funding for this project there 's definitely a commitment round the table to support this project it is not a community center that is owned by the council that is very much one that is owned by the community but we own the land and and we have worked 't know how we 've got to the position that it 's like down to the wire and in a way I 'm really glad that this is not in PX because it actually gives people an understanding and the context of the presentation that we had this morning of the challenge that our council has in terms of allocating its budget when everything is allocated we 're in an annual plan process so my question is how do we get to where we are now busy there 's a commitment around the table to this project but how do we get to the to a sufficient degree of clarity for the Mount Pleasant Community Center and resonance Association to proceed with the project knowing that we will come on board but we 've got a lot more work to do to find the resource to do so and I 'm not a hundred percent sure of how we get there i felt i 'm just wondering through you me and effort i can ask ian if if we were to add n for assurance for the place of community principle or effects leaning too far towards predetermination for that well that 's the thing gets the same values for a determination as the same as making a nice day today chief under it 's the same thing so I just want to be in my comment on there if you 're just making it in principle to see here 's that most Cletus over the line I 'm just wondering whether we shouldn 't take five and talk to the group easy not supported so I mean I think that 's a sensible solution can I just ask because we were told that there 's other grades coming to us how many other groups have facilities that were insured by council they were undervalued to replace me not know your thinking look grannies can we not deal with other matters at this moment could we not deal with us now please so they are actually trying to achieve an outcome here for a community that you represent so I think that leaving well enough lives would be a good idea David but there are some consenting issues and encoder I wonder if an amongst their conversation with the group and stuff that we could factor in any possible sort of assistance through the code of compliance process that maybe he knew we 'd over help to get us over the line as well oh my head 's ourselves a compliance and consents group to have a look at it and requested that we do it very specific enough but at the back that beer and the specific information to see what is required for the code of compliance as opposed to what 's the nice to hear it was optioned for um can I suggests that we follow in device and because we could go round around and sit on me so can we just put a brakes on this for a bit and let the staff of the organization yeah thank you alright say an option for just beer yeah okay so that will the next the next item as the public excluded so in a half day on behalf of the bacon with you now to finish this and then think about them no no we might 't have probably ten minutes five minutes yeah mr. Jun is mr. Germany India okay we could go on to our just a June all right well do you want to don 't take a half an hour for lunch and come back up yep you too long hasn 't come back at twelve-thirty with oriental um that word _"

    "text": "thank you and the next one is can change 52 broad Pune and David East as a conflict of interest and won 't participate unless this item you like to move there again Phil yep and seeking goodbye yep Jamie there any discussion to me yeah I thought we were going to play she 's fit this in simple language just what it actually means yeah the business oh sorry yeah yeah just so show me more somebody reading this it 's quite difficult to make energy and even just a couple of years stick Nicholas events are still quite it looked like that could we just actually know and sort of normal completely business terms what this actually means what the plan change means all parts of it what actually does what it does ok now I think the first thing to understand is that plan change 52 and 84 for that matter have gone through a separate process to the proposed replacement district plan and both of those plan changes were publicly notify prior to the ordering council coming into effect the order in council recognized that these for them by saying that nothing in his order and council effects these plan changes in other words they are completely ring feast in terms of process now that we 've got to the stage once the plan changes that made operative they are deemed to be part of the replacement district plan and they will be inserted with changes having minor E feet so things like cross references to the appropriate clauses in the replacement district plan would be an example of a change of minor effect or perhaps just some weird and mine a clarification around definitions to d 'italia consistent wording that kind of thing so what you 've been asked to do today is to make a plane will make both plan changes operative they will be notified at a public notice and around probably about June night I think and they work that stage be deemed impart a replacement district plan provision has been made in the replacement district plan for these plan changes to slot into that they 're both in chapter 21 the airport or it is slippery Airport zone is chapter 21.3 one point 10 the slight differences in terms of process okay actually do what do they do yes okay what do they do rua pune is basically manages the noise coming out of the operations at the raceway so it is that that 's the scope of it so it controls the types of events the numbers of hours the duration of those hours the numbers of days and it 's quite a complicated when you look at table 1 it is quite complex because you 're dealing with five different variables and putting on that table with four the clearest way in which those rules can be expressed and the table has been a result is quite extensive consultation and mediation among the parties so what it really means is that the intention is that the royal pune motorsport complex can operate at a level which is deep well which Environment Court has deemed now to be acceptable to the community and tens of the noise there are one or two days I 'm anticipating a question from counselor which i 'm not sure what I forget this question taken place between the commissioners decision and now are there the residents who then quite a please resonance group here secured a quiet Mondays so basically mondays will be quiet days the number of double event days that 's when speedway and rupee note the club operator I think have been limited and there has been a there has been a change to what 's called weekday noise this is quite important because it was a bone of contention that when the plan change was notified that the weekday noise that roof Hunico operate normally and getting there you know va va va two vents and special events was around 65 DBA that couldn 't make any more than there now when we got improved monitoring data and improved which set up a logger the noise laga we found that that the car club was operating closer to 70 but they they told the court and they told the mayor told the parties that they couldn 't operate less than that that was basically their existing level and and so one of the court 's decision was to change the 65 DB 80 70 it doesn 't mean an increase in noise all it does is reflect what 's happening already otherwise we will be just issued with non-compliance notices every day so they 're the main changes but it 's it 's real managing noise it 's gone through quite an extensive process of notification submissions the Commission 's decision mediation post mediation work three decisions of the Environment Court okay thank you very much indeed for that is there any possible process that can really go through that that people could possibly take this to for another seat not not planned change 52 there are other standards that hearings panel will hear next month to do with other activities on the site and submissions have been made on that but that goes through the independent hearings panel so things like other recreation activities selectivities that support Runa like they 're you know size of buildings and mounted silence and things like that thanks Adam I 'm Jimmy and then jonnie2 questions that even you reply or answer the weakest of the questions that by the first question I Commissioner tongue he had and also in one encoded decision especially regarding to the table on page 278 table 12 table for lost noise our speed and also the kind of a coatrack knows that the standards what 's a difference because this table I will review is only the environment call met this issue but we 're about the Commissioner tongue in it and kind of the RTC she well I haven 't_''_463.81 attached the commissioners decision the council adopted the commissioners decision back in thick was februari last year when me women OH july may have been when they and i commissioned a release to decision so that that decision was adopted by the council so i haven 't_''_481.12 included here but as i said that the main the main difference that came out of the environment court proceedings because there are two appeals to the Environment Court one was by the car club yes and one was by quite a please yeah there was quite a lengthy period of mediation but it didn 't resolve everything so we have to court I think the main differences are give a respite to the residents after you know Saturday Sunday full of racing so it was there are quiet days imposed as i said before the decision of the Court recognizes that the club is actually operating at a higher noise level than was originally thought but that 's nothing to say that they allowed to make extra noise it just means that it 's a more accurate version of what 's going on out there thirdly there were changes to what 's the rules and the rural areas surrounding rural Pune we had insulation requirements for houses in in and around rua pune now we 've actually got rid of those and relied on the airport rule so the this theory is quite complicated as affected by airport noise contours as well and the airport contours have rules requiring insulation so we 've simplified the plane change so that we get rid of a whole lot of rules relating to people having to insulate extensions to the houses or new houses there so they can just insulate as long as it meets the airport requirement so that 's first if the changes are really under a section of the Act cross-section 293 and these changes were made to enable the plan change to better fit into the replacement district plan which is very helpful because when you look at paint change 52 in the way that set out and it 'll fit quite snugly into the replacement district plan into its current format whether sewing objective and it 's formatting plane change 84 unfortunately and well because it didn 't go to the Environment Court we could at new section 293 to streamline or to sort of men the formatting of plan change 84 so I still got all those explanations and reasons and things that no other chapter in the replacement district plan hairs so one of the changes from the commissioners reporters under Section 29 3 we 're able to make some changes to the the plan change so that fits better into the replacement district plan thank you as second question is because the based on your information particular mentioned this the plan change of plan change of 52 has been completed all the state like you know as a counselor week probably just you know to receive this information but here the Star Trek convention used approves approves opposed rather than received information because of H only as an elected member council we didn 't get involved all those deposits only Commissioner of a villa environment hope also loss of fossil why not use the receipt is information I 'd rather then be used by the proof and he is sure that the council has been involved in these stages now of course this plane change was notified I think before this council came on board was notified under the previous council but the council this council would have received the commissioners decision and oh sorry the commissioners recommendation because Commissioner can make a recommendation and the council would have adopted that recommend or did adopt that recommendation and in it and so it became a council decision at that stage now that council decision was appealed and there is a district plan Appeals subcommittee established which was used by officers to keep the council informed as to what it was happening through the that was come to the district plant peel subcommittee and got approval to partake in mediation so we had mediation and then during the mediation process the council changed its position on a couple of matters and we had to come back to the district plan Appeals subcommittee and get approval to change position from then on we bleed evidence in the environment court and in that environment court hearing concluded i figured when it was never it was last year and the the court subsequently received three informed decisions and we had to respond to those sorry to interim decisions which our legal advisers and us responded to now the released the final decision now unless the council wants to go through that process again it really has no choice but to make the plan change haven 't got a journalist someone appeals and I haven 't_''_830.36 to the high court then the environment court 's decision is final and this the council wants to go and hear the whole thing again now it 's really got no choice but to make the plane change operative under Section C us so mean to receive it really does it doesn 't get us anywhere and unless you wanted to have engaging and further discussion with with officers or the parties but really I think the time has come to make the plan change operative to provide and deed the process okay thank you an evil thank you um thank you I mean I know there 's a lot of work gone in and appreciate getting this simple an explanation around what the changes are um obviously there 's there 's two other kind of related issues which is the noise management plan and also be because the lease so we 're some terms of us once we approve this today then the new waste management framework gets under way he 's had chills yes the the noise management plan which has to be will come into effect yeah there 's also the counselors may recall was last year that they approved in principle the setting up of a community liaison group so one of the first things we need to do is to get that community liaison group constituted and that group would be to monitor compliance with the noise management plan so it doesn 't quite finish here once the plane change operative you still got the community liaison group to to sit up and to say keep an eye on things out there and its main role is to liaise with to form a good relationship with the management of raw a piña and that and there there is it and there is a good relationship at the moment that 's good so and then the council I mean where printer has the motor club as a lease west Kentucky Council is that up for renewal or it is there are two leases there is a Speedway Association as well right again the car club and there are sublease is actually on both part there 's a sublease driving testing enterprise as well but the car cubs lease comes up and december four in your row and then the speedway 's lease doesn 't that 's basically got a lease out there to about 20 50 stars this wondering if we need a resolution around those reports coming 're considering previously was the future of the land property that we acquired so is their kind of another report process under way around that as well yeah that lets ask its roads those six properties yeah that 's a separate issue that lower quite because the noise levels are unacceptable and the council still has to decide what it 's going to do with those properties it 's probably got a little more certainty now because of the page 52 having completed this course but I think there 's a separate report on that counselor it 's um it 's a property management issue rather than a resource management issue it 's the last time we heard from the residents affected by us that was they came to council asking for certain things to be considered yes as part of the mitigation around some of the noise effects yes artists we make sure we 've got a process underway for that well I 'm not only aware any process that there would need to be some typical assessments on the effectiveness on well I think we 're talking about a matter which you need to ask their property consultancy group to come back with on that okay so i will cut that motion all those in favor say aye all right person note that scary thank you very much _"

Holland that money has been committed mr. Holland doesn 't hit at the moment but that is my understanding one were the other that the improvements are a condition of the of the plan change to do our traffic affects originally we were going to put a staging rule on the plane so the airport 's development would have been staged until such time that that improvement was completed the airport strenuously opposed that and we went for MOU instead they may you also provides that the investigations to take place and to Anna safety audit undertaken of intersection so we 're sitting at the moment is that I think the council is committed to the MOU and is kind of obviously provider for funding and the draft then you 'll plan yeah I don 't let Peter so four months after today if we agree to this whatever report that binds us to funding 1.2 million dollars of infrastructure that we won 't be able to change no no that an MoU is not legally binding as I understand an email is really how you work together and what you intend 's in the draft Daniel plan which is the the 1.2 million i referred to earlier that would be a decision of council but but the email you I think the key thing that refers to on the text of their decision is really about the need to you know undertake the necessary through the traffic assessments and particularly in relation to safety and that 's that 's the key thrust of the MOU as around around that you know this addresses the safety concerns which were packed up during the hearing process thank you good all right i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye fine then okay that 's carried _"

    "text": "a second session was there are none and then we move on to item 6 the chicken secret I think if I can just make 3 comments 1 is just a highlight that we had a team of people coming together for the sorghum challenge team this time that the organization had into dead and came food out of 16 team which would actually a tremendous result and really high communicant into the work that they did together ever team and the challenge was around engaging citizens I they had another task to do around it and did very well a second thing of course is a over the last few weeks and sara is no longer and a lot of the functions have been transferred to a number of other crown agencies as along with some functions to us there will be a meeting that means a number of other interfaces for us and weaving together closely with other crown agencies as well as a regenerate try to attack Kuro in dcl inside there 's a meeting in earning may with the chief executives of all those agencies to each other how we make sure we coordinated functions across those various agencies and just the third one item I want to highlight was the request to appoint counsel Scandrick delightful protection structures committee which is really an anomaly apologize yes so the rock for protection structures committee set up in a fairy 2014 to receive a CS and determine and complete applications for funding of rockville protection structures and it has representatives from the affected community boards and councillors spain direct has been tending then we observe the status like that thank you Paul just got a concern around obviously the recent fire and Taylor 's mistake I was in upper to Nicholson 's park and the weekend and I have another play and sniff seen sold some issues around the gardening abatement saw PepsiCo parks on concern that maybe this park slipped off the radar and I happen to speak to a resident who actually fronts on to the reserve in front and she 's only got five foot two and she said she was down there in the grass and it was up through an ich so with the talus mistake fire happening just recently this is quite a concern for the for the people that live there it 's been quite deep populated and obviously maintenance needs he held up but I can tell you the netizens park looks like it slipped completely off the schedule from some way even things i have drawn is the garden is full of weeds the lawn doesn 't have ways being mowed particularly well so i just wonder what some of the change in contractors making sure that some of these parks actually are still on some maintenance schedules obviously for the fire risk that moscato I 'm sure it 's not related to change of contractors but just in terms of the regular maintenance regime so we can take that back and get beachy feeling sick curvy folks don 't clean them in so thank you thank you for this report coming I just note under financial snapshot they 're extra rates income welcome to millions is that one percent effectively of extra rates what slightly more thank you just on the writing and principal underspin of 22 what we 're doing to by way of assuming a skirt program so they will finish at the end of 2 16 are we already geared up getting geared up no we don 't need to wait for them we connect now and career so we have a whole program around the scoot transition there looks at a whole range of things so it 's actually it 's not just about taking out the workers about taking over the information making sure that we have all the details information that they have around our infrastructure about the planning and in the delivery of the week well so that 's an ongoing process because of a substantial work program and we can perhaps update you around that at some stage okay that 's great ok ok Kiki um FL was it yeah yeah and Kelly I just wanted to make a comment about the representation review outcome and particularly know how our council you said was commended by the commission for a robust public engagement and over over 3,000 people engaged so I think often our council can be criticized for this case and enders in this whole area where representation for people as a primary focus of council and such a good job what 's impact on so that the Commission community us so i i 'm sure the council 's would join me and asking you to think the staff involved for that very hard work thank you you know i 'm pretty good Danny oh yeah yani Jamie and then Jamie thank you people add several questions on the press reported yesterday that we 'd agreed as counsel to the directors fees for region Christchurch but I don 't think we 've signed off on that so can you just clarify if we have agreed to that or if there 's a process for us to consider I think the vertices are the standard state services fees that they use yeah so just so I 'm clear it 's not correct that we 've agreed to it that 's just something that set by government it didn 't come from didn 't didn 't go before the council but the government notified that those were the fees that paying outer it is the same everyone 's paid the same right but it 's not a decision we made and it 's not as a setting that we had any answer we have agreed on yeah so cool thanks for clarifying that I 'm the freedom camping I was just concerned to understand what you 're doing in terms of maintenance of the areas that if that have been closed just again picking up on the concerns that have been raised around you know if you take Humphries drive through the wind surf Park the main toilet block is closed is still portaloos there the rubbish bins are overflowing it just doesn 't look like there 's been much attention paid to dealing with the impacts of all that posts the closure all the temporary ban of freedom camping so have you got a program to actually actively monitor those sites around maintenance around getting the facilities actually back in in reasonable working condition so it was actually quite a lot of additional maintenance during the period that they were open for freedom campers and once they were closed they were prior to that there hadn 't been any anywhere just the regular maintenance program from this point until a decision is made about whether they reopened or or remain close so that review is underway and we coming to council shortly so what why would the water be disconnected in Humphreys drive and portly still vampires well I guess they 're not being used in the way that they were but I think check up on them I just think I know we 're over and take a row yesterday and there were concerns being raised a well-run French farm so I just think it would be good to have an understanding of what maintenance is being done or what restoration is being done post freedom like we can do that when we provide a review that all those temporary sites how can we do it so now do we need to wait for abuse I 'm really saying to one of the committee 's okay I was more interesting the maintenance not the by laura v ery but just it 's how the Bible helix and review there is another question for the main to third side with Davy items or something to get the maintenance building well yeah it 's so the two different issues here to see production a weed one sir from from an operational perspective if there are you know I mean it 's always the way that after you know sites been made available for a purpose that there might be a bit of a rundown feeling I know that you bright and felt it for a whole lot of reasons as well because the contracts manager comes up to us and tell us areas without Eddington or French farm or whatever so yeah just let me know exile on the concern that pulls raised around the fire hazard then you know when you 've got vegetation overgrown around rubbish bins for example just looks like someone 's just either forgotten you know it 's a lot of a contract or it 's not it so that I mean I am concerned just wanted to yeah oops I and always concerns um achieve I mean that 's the operational pointers on it the French farmer area it was not the the freedom campers I mean in terms of the numbers that certainly was but not that was not what caused the closure there was a maintenance issue an underlying maintenance issue that really does and I guess what councils are saying is that they want to have an update to ensure that those sites in terms of the maintenance edge are properly you ain 't_:_603.93 and once time reasonably familiar with what 's happening the French firm other councilors wouldn 't be and I 'm sure local councillors might be aware of what 's happening in other I wouldn 't be so yeah joined up update just joined up yeah summary on it yeah and maybe just an instruction to the operations to actually go and look at what 's the you know because i know our board would be keen to submit around better levels of service if that 's needed or if existing services levels are okay but it 's just taking care of someone I 'm just a final question I had was just um wondering i look at earthquake rebuild and operational results and i just wondered what the process is for the skirt repair is to be looking at betterment we haven 't_''_651.99 we don 't seem to get any requests for betterment so when we 're getting streets that are being you know i considered and we 've got money on budget that we 're not spending it seems silly to delay renewing them actually we 've got the funding and skirt are doing work in the street so is there anything cept you 're taking to reinforce the need for a more strategic look at the betterment opportunities through skirt in line with our capital renewal is or capital program because we 're still not seeing any of that coming to us as elected members for decisions we hand over today as we move forward and there 's a memo that 's been prepared at moma well it 's gone out to some of the counselors around how we integrate in VA you and also the skier obviously spirits trying to wind down and i 've got that deadline of december so they 're very work that 's needed to be done under their horizontal and such because you 've got to appreciate the Crown 's walking away from all their funding at the end of june so we 've got to get through that maintenance pier to make sure all that works done there are opportunities to have a look at the way we 're integrating but some of those opportunities are quite extensive and we are now putting forward a combined work program and we 're looking at alternative delivery models so how we deliver it may incorporate a subset of skirt and it may dilute may may look at other things so we are looking at trying to integrate those as much as possible within the existing budget result we 've got to appreciate that there are some areas that we 've only got a certain amount of budget that we can go forward yeah but I think that as a council we were we 've been anticipating receiving requests for betterment and I 'm just thinking of the one that David Easter 's just flipped by again that which is the a single Street you know and it 's a street that 's going to have to be repaired and I know it leads on to a residential red zone so I mean it there are huge challenges as far as the street goes but you know it 's just you know it 's frustrating when you see multiple returns to science to get the good outcome that we 're expecting and then one we could look at and i think david has been replied to on that is around the two million dollars so I haven 't heard a word about it sorry I 've got an email that i 'll redo that email then because certainly I 've got cc 'd_''_804.22 into a copy of that email but that 's been sitting yeah but I didn 't know that 's been festering for about a month now and I 've heard nothing about it but but it is frustrating when we when we are being told today that our operating expenditure is under and below plan our capital expenditures well below clearness and and yet you know I Drive kilometre of more of urban channel along San Albans Park which has no benefit to residents at all and yet we 're doing Barry and patching and deep channel flat channel new deep channel all in the same bits we 've got e bits of old deep channel still being patched in and we we are we were led to believe several months ago that we were going to prioritize a lot of work around the city I don 't see it happening yeah but we are and there has been a note of an email several colleagues have been raising these are shoes and in an appropriate way of food them through the appropriate people at the executive to get responses and so there 's a response come today that that explains that we actually have legal obligations in terms of highly streets in terms of our obligation as a rating authority so see you know as I say we 're getting to the bottom of of these issues it is part of our ltp process the amendment that we 're going through at the moment will be adjusting that expenditure on earthquake-related damage as opposed to the sort of kind of va you renewals that what has been described here is not just the AU renewals that as a legal obligation around high use roads that are at risk of rapid deterioration and and then also at the same time addressing earthquake damaged roads as far as political so it 's it 's around data showed that we will be debating there yeah particularly frustrating where you have one strength of the 30 years has been a high priority and now we 're just patching and probably will the new browsers we get to be done underground and Bauer f is this extraordinary you know see I mean it 's not that simple it 's not a straightest right one or the other what I have it is beautiful what everyone 's complain well some people complained about why rocky road it 's the busiest second road to the airport after fiendish and Rodan memorial I 've it is an extremely busy road and so but i also know because I use it myself that it is a replace the main trunk line or whatever it is underground I don 't even know what those pipes are those rights also very busy can all those hours riders are disgrace it 's almost that we need to see a multi-criteria nellis of how these roads are assessed so that we use so i do are there are all of those things available and i think that we need to kind of take this offline but bring it back is part of the debate around the ltp this is the very issue that we have asked the organization to prioritize I guess girl the frustration date that you 're hearing from us is that for a long time we haven 't been receiving requests for betterment and yet we we kind of anticipated receiving more requests for betterment as a result of the wind down of the scare program not lease so yes if it 's really honestly frustration the Viper adore you there 's no betterment money left in the betterment account so I just don 't have any money to go and say that we 'll get it as part of the annual plan you 've asked for that paper about how do we prioritize renewals replacements some of the words of your meeting aren 't even our roads our state highway so that 's not an hour program some of the other words if we don 't do an energy to stay if I will in future but I 'm sorry I haven 't_''_1083.5 mentioned a state highway while right it 's not enrolled we mentioned a number of times that 's nothing to do with us it 's all state highway yes but so the cousin mention Lincoln Road but we talked about Belle Reve we 've talked about why rocky road and more away from field or from right so the concern I have is in the rush to finish the skirt works the opportunity to actually so I in my view it 's really simple like if you 've got a street that 's going to have four different types of kerbin channel and I 've sent through for the last two years examples of where it 's happening to try and stop it that generates a report to council saying there are f was on the list to be renewed and year twenty skirt are currently proposing to do there appears to this standard the opportunity the cost savings of doing there for renewal now versus later as x do you wish to do it as a council and and we 're not seeing that what I didn 't understand was there all of the money that had been placed on budget for betterment has been spent I didn 't know that so look we need to get a proper report on this there 's no point I 'm were sitting here debating it circularly no I 'm not accepting a resolution at the back of this discussion was it already our staff for a paper to do with our long-term plan and our annual plan process I 'm not going to take a motion of the back cover of a council chief executive report that is not specific in this regard so I 'm just going to take it off mine and we will come back to it I 've got Jamie the under spin project delivery budgeting accuracy but you know I 'm going to leave that while i was part of it something that 's tight lid off line and it 's an easy one that i will give you for the scaling and can i just say that and i have give them credit where credit 's due you 'll see reporters exceptional every time I read it it 's very very refreshing you give us the info that we need to have in a clear and concise way and it 's presented really well so thank you for that the only thing I 'm a little bit unclear on and I do sometimes drill into the cell phone safety stuff a bit just with my background in this area but it was um why do we do acc costs and not refer or two you know total recordable injury frequency legs is there a reason why we do that not incidents no I think it 's just historical so we are actually going to revamp this report in particularly around health and safety so that the counselors as so that you understand what the Rass are and what we 're doing about it okay so this is a work in progress and probably not going to last anyway okay thank you I mean yeah okay thank you merely to purchase first question on page 60 regarding to the local gum official information and the meetings actor my question is if the elect member councillor or tomato member requests the official information weather is still under this actor also separate this own leader you know suitable for the resonance only if you request information is not necessarily it depends on the information if I recently I asked one information efficiently the staff told me they need to under these the boat I just want to clarify we secure means on what 's being us okay second case is on page two twenty regarding to community engagement josue skate in the recreation park popular dating here has been amendment yes the star will organize the community the workshop on seven of june because the after the consultation this issue is quite a wide-ranging of dispute so the start tried to consultation and also to that lost interest group can help to start to investigate there are kind of the suitable location may damage always people need so this the seventh you may actually is not correct like I just want to mention yeah thank you I would canta Elli I just I want to return very briefly I know we 're getting from the issue of roads but I still am a little confused over the issue related to budgets and I just wanted to clarify we know that in some mentions there is no money in the betterment account is this issue relation to budgets and money well is it related to resourcing and deliverability around the resourcing because over the last year or so I 've heard that it is all about deliverability and resourcing because I have always argued that we needed to release more capital in order to get this work done and I 've always been told that it 's about deliverability and resourcing and not money but that 's not what I 've just heard from a stratum sir no no I wasn 't want of a terrifying days issue because I did think there was there was an allocation for betterment but you 're quite right it is about a budget it 's not about deliverability so the question is is the Thira sent a betterment if there is nothing left in the betterment a counter or a funded or budget is it we 're easels and we need to they need to review their thank you David I think early sort of just touched on the subject that I really wanted to raise and I appreciate the betterment is not there but I think the frustrating part for myself and I 'm sure I speak again and people are their way as we we 've been talking for ages about prioritizing our work and and yet we we see examples all the time of work being done that many of us would consider is not a priority at the start and so I 'm not sure when we are going to or if we are going T but I would certainly like to see a complete review of the VA you program to inject more money into a certain road to do an integrated program as we go we can maybe we can only do this by pushing some of the other projects out and advancing some money into these other areas this is approach to be any different from what would to see just what I but it 's not it 's what we all want some priority like everyone else wants that you 're not alone in this no you 're not alone under security I wishes America in our prioritization of roading Ripley 's please and that 's exactly what the annual plan is about and the we 've always been taking a goddamn long time too because it doesn 't come back to us until we sign off at the end of thumb chain and in the meantime in the meantime we are used at the places they are going to come winding around us carry more yeah it 's a process issue around the hoke not referring owns to us anyway right I 'm Lueth budget i will move that we received the report and point counselor seconder so i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye or as opposed to cope that 's scary right I space northern excess bus lanes between ago when Paul climb over lie on the tape all right by email sorry I didn 't read an email that items being lured you see them a noise sorry I think don 't you need a formal resolution to do that then we 've discussed this previously goodbye have we done I should see them yeah _"

    "text": "isn 't a shins but I do have a deputation by appointment Derek and color and Linda Butland on behalf of the Mount Pleasant memorial community center and residents association I 'm just mindful of the fact that this is a on the agenda is a public excluded item number 21 so I 've in terms of the I mean come forward come forward I 'm just suggesting to two counselors that then they may have to be degree of circumspection circumspection around questioning in relation to what is the public excluded items later on but we are very much looking forward to to your presentation Wow all the more so okay dim the lights lights camera good morning Mia counselors thank you very much for listening to our plea for your support I 'll throw it as quickly as we can I think it 's the usual systems and usually ever Delia so the just a quick recap on who we are the association has been going for 60 years and we 're financially independent for all that time for five years we 've been operating from a temporary see there which we bought with our own money at fifty thousand dollars but we needed something to continue our community work while we rebuilt and our business plan shows that once the building is open we will once again be financially independent the new building although it looks quite grand and flash is actually smaller than the old of the building that it replaces but it 's far better designed and has more flexible spaces the funding has come as you see from 38% insurance money 's not a hundred percent as we thought we were going to have on our lease with the council fifty two percent from grants eight percent of which from the Merrill quake Relief Fund and I just emphasize that this is not late payers money but money that was donated or to their council to distribute and donations and fundraising which we continue to do you 'll see from my t-shirt one of our fundraising things the mouth isn 't there and then finally just to get us over the over the line we 've got a ten percent loan 500,000 from the 1300 per week which is quite a significant loading on a community center we must be open and earning living you and to do that we need code compliance and to get code compliance requires civil and earthworks to be complete these are funded as you probably know from a grant that you generously gave us late last year based on a camo marsh estimate which was done at some haste I must admit to get it to the meeting and unfortunately when we got this plan cost it out it was a little bit more than 377,000 came in at 805 which took us back a bit so we met with leaves and we scaled back just to the code compliance is and so we 've knocked it back 22 663 you can see from these this shop that how the knock-back has occurred you 'll see significantly less landscaping which we think we can do with community support in time to come but also a minute he values the front decks which have a lovely view of the Istrian which would be great for learning women who have in fact this latest 430 yesterday afternoon and met with council staff in fact I must compliment Lee butcher the project manager that you put to our case he was fantastic in going through our plan line by line to see what we could set up but we 've now got it down to that we need about three hundred and three thousand dollars of extra funding the importance about no delays a two-fold as I said earlier we need to have the building open so that we can earn revenue to pay back the loan but also the significant cost increases if you run over for example pngs the preliminaries in general is 54,000 if we have to start again after the leaves contract finishes so there is considerable savings to getting it done in a timely fashion so we 've been able to keep the short floor to this amount because of the input from the community up to a hundred thousand dollars but probably more importantly in the thousands and thousands of community hours volunteer hours that have gone into it in our member sort of Linda that we were getting a hundred percent we were getting thirty-eight percent and not only that we had to arrange our own demolition and have to arrange the whole thing so the for us this is a 15-year project five years to demolish the old building build a new building and in ten years to repay the loan and it 's going to keep us really busy for that time so we just saying once again although we 're not council-owned we did provide the same services to the Mount Pleasant community as a council only facility would to that they provide to their communities and although this building project has been a huge time factor in our committee we still manage to run community events like the ones you 've seen the yesterday fest which was very successful this year and a month later we had the house tour which was not only a good community event but raised us as a significant amount of money so we would like you to support us we think you 'll get a community center in the largest community east of the have cost you a few done it yourselves thank you disaster Linda to add any comments to that yeah I just want to say that the under insurance of the of our property has really impacted on us at hit you no need to loss of about four million dollars to us and we 're very independent organizations so we 've just try to meet their selves and its really been at at a huge cost to us and so and also then going into having a half a million dollar loan and that it 's huge so and unfortunately we can 't_''_431.29 say that we 've done it on budget there is at embassy in overrun and but we understand that is quite normal wasn 't projects we haven 't done a project like this before and and so that the civil and earthworks are just a bridge too far for us to go so we really need your support we 're still got fundraising to do on the building itself in for the foot out so we just started hard go this steep further so we really would that some of the costs for the overrun was because we had to raise it a meter so suddenly we 're building ramps to all the entrances what which are a lot more than you would imagine and but it does have to have universal access to be a community center so there are things like this that we 've had to pick up that weren 't in the original costing i 'm just getting some renewed advice on whether we have to consider this as a px matter now because I mean you 've really disclosed all of the information that we felt was commercially sensitive so I 'm taking that advice and I 'm and that won 't be instantaneous so like these lawyers I don 't know they 're just sort of seemed to take and working these things out but but I 'll be reasonably free flowing around questions in determining all time but you mentioned it 's a 15 year program is the five years to get to this stage basically and then the 10-year two-page pay off the line so that ten-year financial plan your ongoing maintenance or that in your building so that 's all been done to death in your theme here maintenance and operating costs so sure and with regards tell you that the completion of the building there will be a builder 's guarantee on that building to ensure any hiccups of faults at secret how long is it agreement from an advice oh I was just standing yeah I think a little chick a little yeah the building contracting it included all the standard warranties that builders get so it was enough for us to access the funding that we needed from lotteries they will require that as well so we really feel confident that we have got ourselves covered in there we go thank you Paul I don 't make you have a question I 'll discretion viagra I do I can 't believe have you 've been strongly episodes on everything with rather the others i guess you 're aware of it we 're relevant only issue so nobody other members SEOs okay I 'll get these Phil Davis gleam so just gonna look thank you very just wanted to ask you to liberate a wee bit on the several and earthquakes that need to be done which clearly have increased the cost because you referred to the girl with the building l into bit a higher level and access issues and any other aspects when that as the Civil War engineering this works that you could too well I should point out that if you notice from the screen that I 've got up there at the moment that the most of the a lot of the workers for car parking and which also is an amenity value to the not the McCormick 's Bay reserve next door you can see that brown rectangular shape is actually a children 's playground and being on the hills it 's really the only flat playground areas so it 's widely used by the entire community and it 's accessible it 's also going to be used by the coastal pathway users so there 's amenity values around car parking of course lighting has to be done along with car parking so there are those sorts of amenity values the building okay yeah i 'm at that david now thank you you mentioned that you scaled back your requirements and it 's been at the cost of some of your landscaping and decking daddy of the do you propose to actually continue with those at some stage or they offer right out for a while now that we would still like to proceed particularly with the decking because that in the original business plan formed a big part of how we can repay the loan because as you can imagine a substantial deck with a view of the estuary at a meter higher will be an attraction not only for the community users but also for others who would want to come and see the fantastic building but also one of our tenants is the estuary trust and there 's a possibility of an educational center sort of thing happening where you can actually view the history and the bird life and all that sort of stuff so so so what sort of costs do you envisage and hair are you going to fund that out of it that i think the costings are around thank you i 'm not sure when did we do things but we we 're conscious at this point that our primary concern is to get the building open and running and that we amenity values as and when we can but if you are to a degree compromising your ability to generate revenue it to a degree we are there 's no doubt about that but we can still I think we inside the building we have and there are small decks but it does it compromises it in a way of that sort of marketability for wordings things like that which are going to be an essential part of our revenue generation so that would add another circa 120 k for the possibly possibly thank you i bleedin identical Thank You Derek and Linda I 'm just looking just some specificity then so the civil and earthquakes I take to be the actual ground any ground treatment and lifting zealots is proposed by council yes d are you saying is that that it also a car park playground and lighting design off the playground was just to point out that the civil and earthworks that we are will be putting in will be used by Pete by the public or people not necessarily using the center that it 'll be have a wider use than that but it is primarily the requirement to have 36 car parks the requirement to have universal access and ramps and to have lighting and all of those sorts of things in case a significant part of the cost for some of the questions have been answered around the fact that you are supplying a car park area for our playground is a council so the question I had is with the drop off of the amenity which is the decking does that actually take away accessibility for certain parts of our community so in other words is a quite a large year of reserve in front of your building if I thought was physically challenged we don 't have a problem accessing it from this building no no you 'd come out with the talking about a she at the front there though Derek the fact 'd be acquired to come around to the other side of the building to use a rank we 've cut the wrench down from two to one as part of that but you would be able to access the building if you had a disability but if you 're at coming you 're in the building and you 're going out to the the ester east side of the building probably will to some of our physical disability might gonna impede me from Mickey exiting the buildings and it makes the whole x is so much more difficulties and because like um also you 've got children and stuff as well and we can possess all that warning it 's it does make the whole it does yeah this should change his compromised accessibility yeah the reason the decks Minturn wasn 't accessible that 's um Oh Yanni yeah thank you um so just so I 'm good what 's the difference in cost between these two plans and what 's the difference of all doing it as part of all the work now versus coming back and doing it now and things like consent building because well it was that whole PNG that we save and also that we would have to bring on another contractor and get them up to speed again and or big delay and then we 'll be opening later and it 's a lot of so I was just trying to understand the community impact of not having that 's completed to this standard you know originally was proposed will add cut like several hundred thousand dollars or is very loss of revenue and increased costs well I think when Willy we got to a figure about 125,000 that can be saved by doing it immediately and that 's comprised that the largest single item of that is PNG from having not having to get a new contractor on board but also the delay in opening it compromised us because our loan to the council has to be repaid whether they 're open or not from the moment when you 're down we need to start earning as quickly as we can so the other part of the Costas significant cost is the inability council won 't see any other thing it is quite said after all this time five years really hard slog the young opening of senior which is quite the juice yeah yeah we 're not happy with the outcome but we 're doing the best we can we we would like to open a fully accessible buildings will full decks and full immunity value but our capacity to borrow any more money is completely gone and as Linda said we 've still got fit-out to do we 've still got to find some shortfall for the actual building so and it 's you know there is no rate per dollar in the building at this stage it is in order to get what we want but instead you 're 303 it 's 404 28 for 28 that the scene and that gets you what you get originally envisaged and still you can do this at this stage at the stage we could do then you just be around the view sweep useful it 's the 433 I just um ask a question around the insurance proceeds because I 'm still that I 've forgotten the detail of you received 1.49 759 3.49 insurance proceeds what would you have got if it have been properly insured for little about 4 million 4.2 million 4.2 million what we value with it was replacement of replacement value replacement value and and you 've got a bit that was the value of the building that was a proper valuation of the building it wasn 't under insured because it wasn 't properly valued it was it wasn 't a proper valuation right so um yeah but we now know to replace it building even on a smaller footprint has cost us much money right yeah I think yeah so okay so we just got what what was given what they see it was at end of the council 's insurance Yeah right never even our lease specified replacement value insurance being part of it it was only when we came to talk to our sisters that we realized that the Civic assure or whatever had put it a ton dem nuh t value not replacement value and they got a email basically saying this we um you managed it we never ever saw what our insurance whilst we need a sort a new documentation at the years and years and years and it wasn 't tall the fatal presume is me your cell phone sure I mean you 're insuring yourself we are you can do we are going to take that particular role ourselves from now on Thank You era de Paul just can you just informally the other members here just this is that she got a war memorial status and how that came about some of it but a history might be actually quite useful just to understand our history very briefly after the Second World War the council are the government had esteemed that where they would subsidize war memorials most of them as you probably know a gates and cenotaphs and things like that whereas that our present community were clever and thinking they wanted a living memorial so they did the community center so the arrangement was that the City Council would provide the land and maintenance and that the government would fund dollar for dollar whatever the 1956 I think that 57 for coming you know it 's built and for this is dennis before so no 54 so but that 's why it 's official title is the Mount Pleasant memorial our rule memorial team we think this time we want to keep it as a memorial center open so that it 's also an earthquake Memorial Center as well because we think that 's what it is memorializing at the stage right and temperature Lotus clarify so the first meeting with regards to trying to make code compliance with leaves with 6 63 and then you 've managed to cut cut effective for 28 and in tppa binds as 303 even though council requirements raised the building and meter which I imagine that headed the costs crosses now that 's 303 above the 377 that we 've already been given by the council earlier and the difference between achieving the full your full plan as the difference of between 303 and 428 so the difference is 125,000 creek yeah right well thank you very much I mean but as I say oh we 're still be dealt with olympiques later or or not if it is then it is simply because of the detailed costumes and contracts and things like that which you know abyss kicked closed because obviously in a contracting environment though they 're confidential to the parties but if I mean obviously we would make the announcement soon afterwards so that there was no delay between you know the the decision and and the outcome obviously you 're on a tight timeframe thank you very much thank you guys thank you all so the nigs dieter _"

    "text": "in what I understand anyone elses forward to their natural environment recovery program although this is described as the previous reporters face but it is the last of the progress report so welcome yes this is the last formal report under the natural environment recovery program and would like to acknowledge and thank Chrissie Williams for leadership effects a pic work three men appreciated by myself and colleagues from the other councils however this is not the last time that you 're obviously here about progress of various pieces of work the Council of doing because it has been decided that the natural environment recovery program and in a sense will be reported through the urban development strategy implementation committee so you 'll get updates via that but of course a lot of the work in here that is in the chart are key pieces of work that you 'll get reported on through other reports that come to counsel in time so just want to pass over to Chrissy to give you more detail about the work as a whole thanks guys thank you madam mayor and councillors so the recovery strategy ceases on Monday and when the Sierra act goes and so recovery programs they 're men date really disappears with the recovery strategy go but as clovers said the recommendation came from the partnership group the technical advisory group that 's gone through to the chief executives and last Friday to the urban development strategy implementation committee that we continue with a partnership group and it may be slightly different membership but across the council 's with no Tahu Department of Conservation and the community in the Canterbury District Health Board the and that that group developed some kind of schedule sort of similar to what you have to to do regular reports probably thinking around six months but currently we 've been doing three years so two to three a year reports that summarize what each of the partners are doing in each of the areas so it won 't have the earthquake focus but it will still be quite similar to what you see you 'll notice on this sucks monthly report you have in front of you we 've changed the format slightly in column as his comments from the different partners about some of the actions that obviously continuing up that gives us some guidance of of what that that partnership group could and could focus on the other thing that 's not reported and here is that since this report was written Environment Canterbury is offered to facilitate that that group to start with so to at least get that first meeting up and going and to get the discussion happening so that 's anticipated so I 'm just I 'm heading to that take questions about the report that you have and also about your Bureau of that partnership group group continuing we do plan to do try and get some media coverage that reflects on that what the nerf is achieved over the last three years about the four years actually and and also how the lessons we 've had from the new ken can continue especially with the cooperation across the patterns Chrissy well let me start because I wanted to thank you personally for the work that you 've done the leadership you 've shown in this area natural environment assumed to be a recovery plan under the act as opposed to a program but that was not to be and but despite that you have turned us into a practical program of implementation so making sure that the works being done is actually more important than what it 's called and the reporting framework for it so these programs don 't work without partners been committed so the council working in collaboration with each and working and collaboration where no Tahoe and other partners and and obviously with other other 40 that like the water management strategy that 's what 's going to make this work I know that counselors pretty much universally were devastated when the hear that this was going to be the last report but as I 've explained to them it 's a program that ceases with the action so when the Act expires next Monday the program expires the recovery strategy expires and we move to a new phase of regeneration but actually the work that 's being reported on fits within the concept of regeneration anyway so regeneration meaning restoration but and I for one and i know that i would have universal support around the table to say that we would want to have the new reporting framework to make sure that this works till was prioritized across the different agencies so that 's that 's all i will takes not a question it 's just a an overarching comedy and fill and thanks for the report Chrissy you 're not last report in there in effect in i guess you can press comment too about how at an organizational level the partnerships and the partnership will continue that 's the first thing I 'd ask you to comment on the other thing though I particularly wanted to ask you about the with Eakins role with an air pollution and the section on that which where there 's comment about a monitoring of dust management processes we might comment on that and also which areas ikan are targeting in terms of yeah I guess here is at a higher risk of increased increased air pollution and so the first question is how do we see the group acting or working but probably meeting less often the technical advisor group was meeting monthly until just this last year when it 's been every second month and third under the urban development strategy you 've got here you 've got the the sort of the three layers of governors and chief executives and a staff group but there 's also other group somebody there 's a planning managers group there 's a transport group and so we see the natural environment group settings sort of similar to that so it 's reporting up through their governance and then and that those the reports can also go to individual partners which we 've been doing with the new it so it 's very very similar and I mean clydes been there pretty much from the start and whether he 's the council rep on that group will be up to the council decide but it 's having someone with only organized within the group that 's got good networks and connections but throughout that the parent organization which because in Clive certainly has the City Council 's so and that 's the intention a puppy with a different name and the reporting as I mean when you when you look through the project titles earthquake doesn 't appear and many of them you know and I think that 's what you were saying meta Mears that you know the reporting will probably end up being quite similar we may combine some of them and obviously water or people by up there and as far as air quality goes I think what we 'll need to recognize is that there 's existing programs in the existing projects in works within each of the partners that are doing this work and that 's been the same around here for the new so the air quality that the Canterbury viet regional plan you have to think of other acronyms not and as it is just about them is just through its hearing stage it 's about to become operative in the next few months and that deals with PMT and PM 2.5 no matter what the source so that 's that 's where the discussion should be head around around dust and that dust monitoring those your committee had a report on quite or had a presentation from one of our commissioners on quite recently and I know this week happening with the littleton community about their concerns about equality with the increase and and truck movement through through the town and end the trucks with the demolition waste that 's been going to reclamation so yeah this route rooks happening and there 's a cross cross council discussions and work happening on it but that 's that 's where the responsibility lies is under that that that regional plan that really a plan and that 's where it should continue so this group would get comments from that group but they wouldn 't be actively involved in and the work of it thanks for see ya know thank you and thank you for the report so it has been really good to get the comments about what 's happening in the action um I had several questions but one was just um I guess at a higher level it has there been any as any sort of going to be any sort of environmental impact kind of you know what what 's happened as a result of all the different actions across the environment and dips and I am 11 kpi 's I guess us to try n make in to summarize some of the work so it 's always finding time I mean two things we 're anticipating as I mention is to try and get some media in public in will write something that hopefully the media will will then pick up we being I guess in cut Environment Canterbury because it 's whether communication supporters come from for this program and the other thing I thought would be fascinating to do would be to take each of these quarterly reports and put them all together and see the progress that 's been made so yes I want we want to do it as just making it a priority in a focus and and I 'm not sure his his work program at song at the moment okay I mean I personally think if we need a resolution I just this is good because it tells us what 's been done around each impact on the environment has been from all from either the intervention or from from the non-intervention in terms of the earthquake so we know for example that there 's been dust issues and certain areas but we don 't know what the change has been we don 't know how interventions have changed that um the other question I had was just around than the natural hazards just be Ken are going to have their regional approach to managing natural hazards so it 's on page 235 just the top comment regional approach to managing natural hazards risk document and work tend to be completed by end of june two thousand sixteen so i wasn 't sure how we kind of if we 're fitting into that it says that we 're contributing to that but there 's not much time before when that workman gets approved and it 's not quite sure what when we 're going to have them both as counsel may be better for your answer that but certainly the regional approach as a regional approach so the team territorial authorities within the can be the first this discussion or almost an aside discussion or part of their discussion as as how the greater christ church councils and think about the coastal hazards and I know you have it your have that discussion going on so and but I think it 's probably better that one of your staff answer dated about what your involvement is with the region that I 'd like present at those meetings and involved and do you know if it 's going to be any community consultation around around the one are you referring to Yanni page 235 the comments for action from April 2016 project number one regional approach to managing natural hazards risk it 's the final comment Butler sorry the first comment number one project regional approach to managing natural hazard risk document work later be completed by the end of june 2016 I 'll just briefly respond we do have staff who are party to the regional strategic discussion and I can 't understanding is that Eakins regional natural hazard strategy is very much a stocktake and identification of of the work that needs to be as council will be looking at what we need to do to support the the actions out of that strategy so just in terms of the community consultation engagement conversation but this I think is really important is there is there a process to for that to happen there will be this is early investigation those room that this came up during the long term plan that in the long term plan we were proceeding down the path of the natural hazards ourselves and he can set at the end of the table and said I wouldn 't say we 're doing this as a regional thing come join with us my love is that they 're on board we 've got and that 's what it says it says CCC is contributing to eat ends regional approach to managing with natural hazards rest so Chrissy 's answer is correct the council will keep us briefed on our involvement in that regard of course the community is going to be involved because for example the government pulled the coastal hazards component of the district plan review in order for us so what we 're doing so well informed by all the public that the Regional Council is doing because actually that coastline that sits between us on one side of the waimakariri river and the one the coastline that sits on the other side of the waimakariri River I mean they look gobsmacking Lee similar but so that issues in different parts of our region are going to be the same and and to have a collaborative approach seems much more sensible to me when all of the coastal science sets with an EK anyway so we 'll be drawing on that and of our communities so now I 'm quite comfortable with where we 're up to so much more joined up approach and both Waimakariri District Council and Selwyn District Council that and the process of reviewing doing their reviews of their own district plans over the next two to three next three years and so it 's I don 't know who this is right word but it 's almost fortuitous that your your coastal has a stuff has been deferred because the discussions can happen at use the same level of sea level rise from your planning documents and rather than heading but that might lose a sensible pattern oh they say that sarcasm is the lowest form of which I 've done ice creams intelligence here so isn 't may be possible then for us to get a copy of the draft framework connection plan that that II cannot what we 're not going to do that off the back of the support yani this is the final sort of the natural environment recovery program i 'm sure that the AG committee can take up debtors and ashy if they want to um Glenn yeah thank you a couple of questions also wish to acknowledge Chrissy 's work and the updates we received wrigley before we 've had as well they 've been good just my first cushions over our project three in terms of the future placement of the infrastructure in the residential red zone we submitted our options to Sarah nearly 18 months ago so just wanting to check now from Monday going forward how that 'll work no this is not the it 's not Sarah we 've haven 't_''_1001.16 got Sarah no I know but this work is identified in project three yes but it 's not you the report on what 's happening is not an opportunity to ask people that are not involved in the actual delivery of the program the answer to a question about delivery so again we can deal with that in a different environment no I was also an innate provide the organizational structure going towards that the new report is not an opportunity to ask your Christian you 'll ask about low emission burners internal will not fish I 'd like to ask about that this this was a recovery program it was set up under the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery right so you know there are a number of issues that we 're having reported on so it 's really more about process rather than about the specific details of the work of the programs let 's sit underneath it because the delivery agencies are different I think we also need to remember is that I 'm I 'm not here representing Environment Canterbury under the partnership so here you in one Maccabean Selwyn and all contribute to my employment so I 'm not reporting as a keen representative which is whether ears stuff sucks you 're kidding Toby appreciate and get there yeah okay our poorly on up i just had a question about number ten just wondering if you can shoot a bit of light on the weeds along the avon river but Accardo and adjacent land still reported as a problem this is from the community so the community you 're gathering a number of times people reporting and say well that some can 't fill it sweetie and they probably think it 's because we 're not doing the maintenance because of the earthquake but there is a certain a number of weeds that are meant to be there is it correct only riverbanks they 're not necessarily meant to be pristine because here 's how you define wait if we talk about weeds that are recognized under peer strategies I wouldn 't have thought we 'd want them and Gunnar is one of them that suiting in the lower Council and the Environment Canterbury have been working on for a long time and it 's very very relevant but this blackberry down the you know the river so I 'm not sure there 's anyways you want to be there it 's just it 's it 's just councils priority about development working on those weeds until we know what 's hit but do you think sometimes people think of the grass as long around them I don 't wait not the people that would have reported this okay thank you alright so I will has somebody moved in the powerful seconded by put that motion all those in favor say aye oh okay no that 's scary thank you very much thank you XP look forward to returning in the next aspiration to me um okay _"

rebuild it 's been a long time coming and it 's been an excellent process the the very beginning process wasn 't so excellent but the last two and a half years have been really really good the Joint Working Group has been fantastic dominated by the community they have worked really really hard both on consultation of the wider community groups and and meetings on design and if it 's been really appreciated yeah it was it was a newish process of staff and they have been excellent working with the community lot of progress on this great so who would like to move that Paul Sigma yani just my google 1 comment us feeling like effect Thank met Cummins technically he 's done a great job keeping these guys together and they would it 's been it 's been an interesting price very good prices but it you know it 's had its the issues back to the working group and we 've come up with a really great result yeah oh oh yeah yeah a quick question oh um has there been any talk with the group of bishop del in terms of how you approach this from the you know the community level in fact i was talking to another community group last night her concerned about the new community center that they are having built and i think that a a meeting of varying community groups from around the city who are God moving into new facilities for those groups some of them who haven 't had experience and running facilities before looking at she 's rather than staff dealing with these on an on it on an ad hoc basis would be really really useful and yeah yeah I would suggest that I mean if this is part of the new community led development model we 've got Bishop del and Sumner and they 'll be other ones it would be good to meet you have a internal group that 's actually looking at feedback from how that how you wrote a kind of regeneration wins being put on who I should know either because I just think the opportunity there you know get a mess of car part that sucks out on a street and you and we 're building a new facility and we owned most of the land there I just think that that 's just screaming out for a regeneration UCL and there 's a bird 's policy now and we need to make sure the DC elves being set up and there 's a good policy now it 's all the ingredients for you all the ingredients are there does talk being being I just want to make sure that internally and counselor is capturing ideas and sharing them but is she we get ways to support groups so they 're going to be running these facilities as well it 's true I mean actually the other one that I 'll throw into that mixes I don 't know a community 's fast because their new facilities opening on the nineteenth of may I shall be opening up with me chair of the Illinois going to be run by actors in partnership with the council yeah and it 's a new model of working it 's a completely new model of working and that is quite exciting so I throw them in the mix to Rex I think they actually really good video is a summer people that I don 't know if people yeah muffs and all those years old high school yeah can I just saline that when we started this and tolerance we can party to build the community centre fier Ginny hurry the initial meeting people a lot of learnings from other projects so she 's actually all over there at the moments I think that 's in place but we can just make sure that the work is carrying on but that she is all over there yeah I think some of these groups are a button unsure about what they 're doing and actually the group last night was talking about you know how do we contact other groups to see what they 're doing right in the relationships of counsel my sister is unique can we can would get a but this will set us say an action peace out of it and I want to get the wedding ripped so that the so the rain range of community groups involved and establishing and running council community facilities be what sort of all have a way to have a way of communicating that you have each other make it beneficial it was an initial workshop to discuss the range of yeah bottles and models and learning you know so yeah you could say forum be developed but in a clue arranged or community but yeah okay bit this that 's true that a forum that a forum be established pulling together the range of community groups involved in establishing in running council community facilities in order to ensure that the benefits of their experience our shared what I 'm standing is just that I start have actually taken the more from the Summoner working group whether this is like no development forum so instead of at just bang counts the laws and council council staff it 's it 's a dream that 's a long unity groups i think that 's weddings enough to be i just wonder about the there who does the V refer to its really the benefits and learnings of others and experiences are shared okay let 's just each others others its other groups feeding and above all those groups are there we want all of those group to the air so the sharing each other 's ya blue names are based on the experiences of others who have already set up yeah facilities that they 're learning to others um well just experiences yeah room when I 'm sorry to hear them yes variances one of the other things I think that will be useful here is is that actually council will be learning from this as well not just the group 's themselves because they might be common concerns from those groups that then currently one on one with a council but there becomes a common concern about the relationship of council then it 's on it all good we did a council community forum bear step if so so you 've got I mean it 's quite clear that all right so Andrew just a comment from the committee certainly was a pleasure the communities Housing and Economic Development Committee to hear from the Joint Working group that they were very supportive of the resolution that the community board had passed it was great to hear from the community board who were in total alignment with the Joint Working Group that they had passed a resolution that we the committee was certain up to ourselves this has clearly been in the end a very good process the level of community involvement at the breadth of community involvement through the Joint Working Group clearly has been one of the keys made this work and I just like to record the committee 's thanks to both the Joint Working Group the staff and the community board for getting this project to the stage that it 's now at and yeah I welcome seeing this to progress to a build an opening of what I 'm sure will be an excellent facility excellent yeah oh yeah cool thank you um yeah I 'll speak and support of the resolutions I think one a council library and a community center and museum coming together so this is pretty unique hence the need I think for that wider Joint Working Group because you did have three different organizations coming together in a new joint facility which is quite unlike most of the other facilities that we 're doing not to say that there can 't be listens learnt from that and my support having that regular community forum um I think it is really important that we have to weigh engagement and that communities have a chance to engage and we just had we had a presentation I think a month ago from the employ centers and the work that we 've got around that so I think there 's actually already a kind of informal network of groups that are doing work in the space but could probably be extended to to be a little bit wider but I just want to make a point that this is a really significant step for this community when when the earthquakes hat and the multiple earthquakes damaged the facilities the reports that council got at actually lost the largest number of facilities and so that presented a challenge said they can 't help but who they are and and but the interesting thing in this area was we looked at having a temporary library but the community feedback was they were really keen to get on and spend the money on the permanent facilities so that have been incredibly patient we put the mobile library going going out there and work through those issues to get some sort of library service but fundamentally people do really really miss the library it 's a destination for people took when they come to the beach but also for local people to access those upstanding services so this is a combination of the old historic Summoner town hall that was run by its own management committee and the library unit coming together so that is quite a new model and it will be interesting to see how it develops but fundamentally I think this is really great that this shows that the commitment that this council made at the start of the term to get community facilities rebuilt I just echoed the thoughts that were shared in terms of thanking the people that have contributed hasn 't been an easy or a smooth process but you know I think it 's a process that ends up with a really good result which is the important thing thank you yeah right i put the motion all those in favor say aye oh there 's a post they know that 's carried thank you very much the games congratulations to the board thank you for the work that is done and could I invite _"

timeline in a scope of works for reinstatement of the Red Cliff civilians were safe and accessible conditions sound foundation power to actually sound drainage and windows in any measurement of the window up to the extent of the allocated budget and for the ownership of the red cliffs pavilion be transferred to the reckless residents association or nominated legal entity for a nominal amount of one dollar and at an mou was signed prior for any reinstatement griggs convincing I think that captures that and in one question to me I 'm sorry and none sir was easy then so does they need to be dim doesn 't need to be just do we need to specify when the ownership changes I don 't know I thought it was prior to any reinstatement works commencing it sees that this is probably maybe being signed gimme ended a mou signed prior to any reinstatement works guessing that yeah yeah yeah I 'm just just just clarifying whether the ownership changes at the time the MOU is signed I just wasn 't put on it sorry to the buzzing EG on the screen again I 'm really sorry oh can be on completion um is it on completely not be an issue at all i don 't know i did send an email to see if i get a staff member da no no no I 'm well if it 's if it wasn 't easier no why don 't we change the orders of that a Memorandum of Understanding a sign prior to any reinstatement works commencing and that the ownership big transferred though that it doesn 't matter yeah so it doesn 't matter so you can hit any say to me but jokes oh yeah that 's right time get rid of them okay it may not need to be resolved winner does it is chicken well the budgets there yeah so it turns out that a Memorandum of Understanding a sign but I attorney reinstatement works commencing it 's okay and that the ownership advances you angry contemporaneous or post and number fool has been changed so it says that in the event of the mou not being interested to with the association that may it be referred back to the community board for fear which is fascia in here alright so would someone like to move that Paul seconded by yanni do any discussion David yeah look I 'm a little curious I suppose if we look at the history of a number of community pavilions and things around the city and many instances the opposites happened is that the the local community hasn 't had the wherewithal or the ability to to carry on the ownership and maintenance of the hall and that 's transferred to counsel and here we 're sort of gone the other way great yeah but I mean so what happens in two or three years time with the few years time of the reckless residents association mr. funk tall not opera who does it come back the other way again or is that part of the Memorandum of Understanding us I just sort of make the analogy way in recent times I think of the hall at Newton at North Beach for years was a community asset and a struggle to sort of look after and now it 's gone as a council and facility it 's gone the other way so are we I 'm just looking holistically at longer term you know what is the sort of the philosophy of operating and maintaining community facilities this one seems to be going back to the community well is going back to the community oh I want some sort of assurance in the memorandum of understanding that the community has the ability and the wherewithal to sustain this operation for some years into the future and I don 't think we can get that but it was originally built by volunteers it wasn 't built by the council it 's built that I mean that troubles has got a it 's got an interesting history oh yeah right look I don 't_''_296.69 I 'm John just probably being the devil 's advocate here that I 've seen more probably yeah well I am putting the divots they yes an opportunity for council to adopt a principle where we we walk beside these organizations and we make sure if they do start to dip which often volunteer groups do when their numbers Wayne that we walk beside them and and helps them rather than just ditcher that your resource because it 's not working you we just keep an eye on things and supports and let 's see that in surely puffin oh yeah so just prior to the earthquakes this building had been privately owned and it was gifted to us so we read gifting but with a in a partnership arrangement with the local community I mean I think it 's of 11 but your pointers is taken because I think what you 're saying is that we really do need to consider these matters on a you know sort of a principles basis rather than an ad hoc basis and think is what you 're saying and it 's that I don 't disagree with that either all right i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye oh I say no that music award for that if that you 've put into making this happen long process in it some really good results put out looking bored of your foot thank _"

    "text": "um district policy and the staff recommendations are on page 201 so what I like what I actually know they 're not on the strategy and finance ref you in at the pre-meeting end one of the suggestions on the consultation approach is that we add a short consultation document in front of the draft policy that highlights the key thresholds so that when it 's out been consulted on people can see the thresholds for the you know number of people the percentage that have to vote that you know the percentage return the percentage of the vote on those return and also the amount of money that it has to be it has to raise some felt that smaller business districts that might want to have a bud wouldn 't be in the ballpark for a hundred thousand dollars a year so and I thought that that would be a way of ensuring that people focus on the thresholds and the consultation because this is very a draft going out so if you were comfortable with adding in the woods with the addition of a short consultation document consultation approach would you be able with them so that 's moved by ref seconded by Jamie um is there any discussion Danny yeah I think it 's just really important that the community took in these business areas understand the issues around the thresholds and turn out what we are currently proposing is that one-fifth of a business area could sign up that entire business area four-fifths of that area to be rated for the business improvement so I I endorse us making clear in the consultation document that there are choices and options for people in terms of feedback around the level of both voter turnout and also agreement in a local area to actually sign up that entire area into the process and into the scheme so I think it 's really good that with we 're going to really make that clear through a consultation document that you know there are a number of different things I think sometimes it 's easy just to look at the numbers and not actually understand what that means but as we 're currently proposing as I said approximately one-fifth fifths through this scheme and I think that 's you know obviously something I would welcome feedback on I I person and not so keen on that but I understand we need to get this out to consult on it and so the sooner we get it out for consultation the bitters Paul on the flip side of that I think this is a great piece of work it 's going to enable some of these areas in our city to be able to become self sustainable we often fund some of these their business associations through our grants and I think this is a really great way of allowing businesses to step up and if you take control of where they see themselves going building more cohesive sort of planning for the area and promotion she 'll think it 's really really important in my previous role we had done quite a lot of work in the series so it 's really great to see this policy come to the council today I 'm really excited about and I think that the consultation process will bring out some some Henson has pointed out but I think it 's great piece of work and I really want to thank the staff for what I 've done here because I know that 's been there quite a big piece of work with them to put together and it 's great to see it come here today like the rest of the members here will support it um Andrew then Ben yeah just briefly I welcome the addition of the new wording there yani is certainly canvassed the issue around the the voting for this reasonably well that 's closed 5.25 the issue that I 'd raised in the informal meeting was relative to close 5.27 in our report today where the prospective bid needs to be able to generate a minimum targeted revenue so through a targeted rate of a hundred thousand dollars per annum certainly there are some areas if we think of village centers the areas that suburban master plans have been dealing with such as Sumner reckless littleton sidim edgware new brighton possibly i think is questionable whether there would be a critical mass of businesses to be rate that was considered reasonable for the the building owners businesses in that area to be paying so I 'm pleased that that 's another area that will be highlighted in the consultation document and yes certainly welcome this going out for consultation I think there are some really good ideas in here and I think it 'll bring a very clear benefit to various business districts of the city i 'm particularly focused on the the way that this will have some benefit in the suburban centers but i think we need to make sure that we come up with a policy that is able to be applied in as many areas as possible so that as many areas get the opportunities of this so certainly welcome this some going out to consultation and well from the consultation document highlighting what I think will be the areas of interest Glenn thank you I agree on the consultation what I 'm interested in those the parameters surrounding that so if you have community ground-up initiatives such as surf strategic urban regeneration for some new brighton they attempt to do this 'm not sure whether the parameters and the consultation would be broad enough to recognize that because the way they don 't exactly fit as formula and you may use public funding which they 've obtained to do the sort of things that are described in in the pit such as you know local improvements extra rubbish bins of sierra so we might display ourselves a bit constrained by the policy and the parameters in the concert because this is about rating and this loose you through their grants group as it did last time so it can partner with the council and quite different ways and all really does yeah one of the proposals was to kind of ever a localized wait that 's not right that 's right get that this plus surf yeah and yet so Jamie things but yelling touched on a fraction of property owners or business owners being able to to sign themselves up to being part of a bit and yanni is right end point of this is the you know you have Bayan and ownership from those property owners or businesses and well whereas that same fraction could stop them being part of a bit so it so does fear and I do want to note is what this is just they 've extended the boundaries of the bidden Parnell and they had a record turnout of about fifty one percent so too to give you an idea of the sort of turnout and what 's considered a good turnout it 's kind of like local government elections then that 's you know if you 're the third was something like that it 's actually quite a good turnout so 51-percent turned out and are now to do that which was a very high number though in st. the only other point I 'd make is that I think it would probably be too early right now for a good to be in the central city because when you don 't have tenants it means that the optics is going to be worn by the landlord so timing is critical as with everything there are some other established areas whether it 's in the East or bishop day where I think that at work in other parts of New Zealand was seen at work in other parts of the world and it just allows those local businesses and the areas to be in charge of their own destiny and I think that 's really powerful so for us to administer this IDK wat council lonsdale said that I think it 's um it 's been a really good piece of work and yeah I 'm a big fan of birds and I don 't think in this Syria needs to be limited to just businesses as well because it can be misleading it 's a lot wider than just beneficial to business yeah and Tim yeah i just think this is going to be a great help to those periods like kitchen and sell and shops which are niche they fully up and running but really have but built and i think that some of those businesses are landlords are looking at how they can sustain those rents on new buildings which are very different to the old rates being charged the previous to the the earthquake so i think there 's how they can promote and improve their areas and this will be a great help to goes but it is horses for courses because each business area is very funny as financially different to others so for instance if we have a a right across the border 100,000 it 's not going to work in these years but it will work at a different level and it 's all we 've really got to look at that and it 's through that process that we 're going to go through so i think it 's essential to get feedback from those different groups and those different regions thinking trying to find the percentage that very well as the league 's isn 't gonna actually say i mean if we 're going to talk about numbers i think it 's quite important that voter turnout in local elections is around forty percent or under and actually a counselor can get elected with under twenty-five percent yeah i 'm off the people vote in their areas I think we got to be careful with numbers we have I think three thousand submissions one set of the total population a hundred people can have a huge influence on a particular policy which is less than point zero three percent so I think these numbers are actually quite good and as Jamie said it 's quite easy for people to block something from their unhappy with it and you know to address Glenn 's point I think it is important that we are flexible to all kinds of proposals coming from the community around redevelopment so hopefully that will this will flush out some of that as well but this is also a pretty standard policy that 's being used in Auckland for many years yeah I fell in love with this concept when I saw it first operating in New York City and it 's made such a mess of difference and you know some business improvement districts have actually taken the opportunity to improve the physical environment of their local community which is a benefit to everyone it 's not just a benefit to the businesses sure they benefit because people feel more comfortable and safer and more sort of respected in from it and actually birds do partner with local community groups as they do with their councils and and that concept of partnership is very much one that we 've been trying to promote so I 'm very much in favor of this I think that by adding in a consultation document that highlights the key thresholds that keeps people 's minds focused on that but I think people should remember that there are people sitting around this table that will have nothing like the percentage of the the support that these birds will give okay I think it 's probably a timely reminder they are but the motion notice ask that you put um see supra just talking to my foot recorded as per their strategy and finance um okay well can

these I like a pittance or I could put a feather buyers really good just a chick is a process to work I don 't you know no what a big thing but there 's a process of actually dealing with this is it through again I so it is a legal process is in place and of course it 's our compliance assurance and related to your case meters that that we can 't influence others yeah like a beautiful start I really didn 't make any comment anyway and we 've had the compliance people was I 'm just interested to see on 148 that Aiden curb memorial Scott sculpture or yes thing is there going to be reported back to Council we 're doing Merle was more work going on that our board didn 't actually I 'm fully agree with the proposal that was put forward by staff and his work going on with that as far as as late as yesterday afternoon so there 'll be a different outcome I think on that Aiden feel dumb memorial and what was probably is it not a local O 'Shea to the local issue that 's actually a city issue because the city put the money on budget when it agreed not to acquire the oldest farm building in Kendra or one so when the report came to council the council decided not to do to acquire the property or not to do whatever we couldn 't because we couldn 't work a while because it was a resource can she brushes and initiate and kind of substitution I guess of saving the building they put money on budget to do a memorial so it was just came to understand kind of what was happening and happiness was no fun oh I think it here is as far as the memorials concerned but and and the funding for it would be you 'd be right dear um else again we can just get them maybe a memo but it 's a it 's a work in progress trust me we believe some of the artifacts out of that be if we haven 't delegated it then it 's possibly an oversight because as far as I 'm concerned that 's a local issue and the local community board should be making the final decision on it that 's so thank you and well it 's not careful issue concern can we find out whether what is a local will show you that the wood made a decision to have a memorial how about memorial was delivered us up to the community board but anyway when women the decisions been made whatever the appropriate processes you 'll be reporting back to the council captioning by way of one of these reports yep it 's also the how many

from Vienna may be okay in do you want to join us at the tomatoes and I Mary Mary do you want to come down as well I don 't know no no football no not you don 't know it stay here cuz they just ripped from two guys Karen and Ian can come to the table supplementary to the city i 'll save it sorry I kind of must or let 's say it 's changed to go through strategy and Finance is that right sorry it 's just now making about ending from ian 's that in fact the advice is different it 's a bit wrong okay um what I was asked to have a look at issues around the proposals that run the last two reports and in principle around or principally around conflicts of interest which I have done in the relatively short time available to do it my conclusion was that the housing management board had the delegated authority to make the decisions that it did in terms of the appointment of Erickson trustees to the hotel turkey Community Housing Trust but I also have pointed out a couple of areas where we might just need to check ie the process that was used to appoint those members and i also have come to the conclusion that i don 't think my recommendation would be not to disestablish the housing management board at this point because i think it needs just a little more we look a little more thornton to whether or not there are any implications for that one arising from the original delegations resolutions made by the council as far as I could see there is still quite some significant work still to be done by the board and the implications reference of a committee and I just have the feeling from a process point of view that we should make sure that we 've covered off those sort of issues before we make a decision whether or not to disestablish the housing management board so I mean that 's the bits yeah two different things so one we were we were asking for whether the original appointment of counsel trustees to auto tawheed Community Housing Trust was little and you 're very clear that it 's not on not not unlawful so so that that measure can can proceed because we 're delegated it but I think that we have decided because the housing management board now needs to have counselors on us that can vote because of conflicts of interests of others we would prefer to disestablish the housing management board and and that the the meters come back through the Community Housing Trust following consideration out there I mean whether its recommendation from strategy and Finance or whether its recommendation from cheddars probably neither here nor there I 'm not sure you know can I just dumb I i thought the proposal to appoint two extra members to the board should proceed because that will go to some some weight or not it was the debate we 're not interested in appointing to people that cackles others are conflicted it it raises a question about the about the sense of the process going forward they 've done the tasks that they were set up to do and now decisions can start to flow back through the council that 's that was I mean there were only ever in a temporary position they were never to be permanently in that position as I understood it sorry possibly the report you 've got me was written before we got Ian 's advice and Roberts actually put in to try and pull that together I suppose see there is a change their own strategy and Finance and Robert may be able to talk to about that it was just that the decisions that are still be made more around the allocation of resources of property of money of that sort of thing so that 's why I think and I don aware that the report that 's on the agenda was written before we got ians and so that 's why there 's a slight conflict between the two I don 't know Robert whether you want to add anything to that now you 've described the circumstances the reason the report recommends is the preferred option that the decision-making go through your strategy in finance is to minimize the conflicts of interest that exist I know that some some councillors have the view that it should go through the cheat committee and yes it could but the Andrew the situation there is the thing shared committee is chaired by one of the trustees the chip trustees and two members of the cheek committee are trustees also so the reason that the report opts for the strategy going through strategy and Finance is to try and minimize those conflicts been and in alley okay just on the neither here nor there comment you made in in relation to what Robert said if it 's not acceptable to go through chip which in my view is we have the knowledge base in don 't think it should go certainly not through strategy in finance actually should come straight to counsel that would be the option so if it 's not going to get supported and there 's a lot of work still to be done over the public were caked the the buybacks etc so that could be an option that we still need the housing management board going but if it comes to that point in the discussion over stretchy in finance or rather it comes straight to counsel if it can 't go through jee le and then ref thank you look can I just clarify I thought the issue was that there was a suggestion that there was a conflict of interest with regards to housing management board members essentially appointing three of their own to the chip my understanding was that that was being looked at if I 'm hearing correctly because I 've heard you use the phrase not unlawful you saying it wasn 't unlawful what they did but I 'm still not hearing whether there is a perceived or real conflict of interest there because at was if there was a perceived or real conflict of interest we couldn 't disestablished or shouldn 't disestablish the housing management board until we had addressed some of those because there could be resolutions procedures and so forth that need to be revisited and that board needed to still be in place for that to happen have I misunderstood something know that that 's principally what I 'm saying that right the board was able to make the decisions it did however it does raise the issue of potential conflicts of interest which some I 'm saying need to be managed I 'm not saying that the whole process is flawed because of it I 'm just saying the conflicts of interest need to be managed appropriately and that 's why one should stay together and one of the ways of doing that would be to appoint two extra members to the board and the other thing I 'm saying is that I wouldn 't disestablish the board right now because I think the sort of issues you have raised I think there needs to be further thought I can 't tell you exactly what they are right now but I think we need to get provide you with words more advice around it okay thank you babe ya mean Jennifer I don 't have a particular view on whether it should be established or disestablished the housing management board I think for me that the main issue is this conflict of interest issue which is cropping up all over the place I mean clearly this should be reporting back to Chad because that 's the Housing Committee and the reason it can 't_``_584.39 be is because you 've got people sitting on it on three different things involved in the same process and that 's what we have to sort out so I think probably when I think about the delegations we gave to the housing management board they 're probably too broad but I think when the delegation around appointing trustees to the trust was given I don 't_''_604.97 I think there was an assumption that the board wouldn 't appoint themselves that there would be some kind of process and I think that 's really resolved no I 've agreed that we probably need to look at that process and see whether or not in particular we complied with our own policy on the appointments of directors to council organizations and Phil and one of the things you mentioned is that there 's still some important tasks for the housing measuring board to carry out so I wonder where that some of those would be sort of commercially sensitive or and a commercial but I wonder to just outline those that they are with its Carolyn Tangela fatal what remains to be done which should be done any introduced ting and increased number of members on the board so the and the terms of reference the things that are still outstanding I 'm just trying to find them basically around the 50 million transfer of assets the signing of the lease would be the two main actions that are still outstanding it is substantial these issues that we shouldn 't delegate just you know I mean it this is this is what bothers man we did do it with wheedle agree but I don 't people better protection if it comes back here for sign off and which is why I thought we 'd agreed with on that long does establishment would proceed but I can see that there 's there 's issues that the trouble was is that probably the only reason strategy and finances mentioned here is because because Andrews the chair of the cheered and other members are of all matured so yeah it 's hugely challenging anyway Jimmy and then thank you thank you met one question if we in order to put a to a counselor in the Uni stone house amazing appalled so the they were increase the number from currently four to six and from now on you know during the house imaginable meeting to discuss all those the issues were the current sweda a kind of remember they also become the tataki Community Housing Trust a support members whether they have to declare a country interest or not depends on the some specific issue they need to be decree or all kinds of Internet have to declare this account for interest quite often the interest will be aren 't aligned there 's those counselors who are also on the trust will need to either stick back with not take part use the heart okay thank you yes in that regard you know I know and that 's exactly the point I 've been going to make we haven 't recorded that I mean I speak for myself I 'm not participating in this discussion because I 'm in on either conflicted or there 's a potential as a perception of conflict and a that 's my point of view I don 't know what Vicki and Paul are doing but I just wanted that record it and pull it pause on it yes the other one yeah so its case yawning oh yeah nothing um I thought we were going to get a presentation on what 's happened with it all our house and stuff because it is it does feel very still quite messy and and there 's lots of different things that have happened and lots of changes that have happened from the housing a cord through to you know the different resolutions we 've think that would personally think he would actually help hopefully clarify what the different roles we 're a lot of different factions word and your apps moving and then we can work out a strategy of how best to do that yeah we 're getting we 're getting match in a couple there 's a recess week next week so I think it 's either the fourth or the 11th so it 's on on a Monday but in a workshop that 's just a question is um council akata and i mentioned an option for should read instead bit from the table I mean it says I know it 's redic but you know just want to clarify so leave no one in the table so what there were a number of us who expressed concern when the original paper came up we were deeply concerned that the reason for managing conflicts of interest was to appoint two more members that didn 't appear to be a good way of resolving the problem at reinforced there is a problem it 's a at best it could help but it matters that you know we were aware of the issue two extra would help Plus close management of any conflicting issues the delegations to the housing management border to the group as a whole and not to the individual members housing management board will make decisions collectively through a formal meeting process the hmd is subject to council direction and policies including internal policies and any legislative requirements relevant to decision-making by the council so I mean to put two more members on because three of them can 't make participate in a particular decision this yeah it just doesn 't work so just makes it easier but but but I 'm comforted by your statement that although the appointments process may not have been that the conflict of interest did not strike down the lawfulness of the appointment of counsel trustees but I 'm very aware you know that were in a state of play at the moment you know there are things that are happening and we don 't want to hold up progress but we want a good reporting and decision-making mechanism from here on up yeah and not sending you know or not making that that we 're part of say in this instance cheap committee Judith complex of interest wouldn 't_:_1014.66 that set a dangerous precedent I mean we have members declaring interests on a regular basis here this committees large enough that it will sustain a quorum most times without three people so people have conflicts over heritage grants was anything down the one that set a dangerous precedent to now rule out what 's an essential part of the terms of reference on the grounds at some may have and it was which which part you 're saying we 're going to rule out I mean I 'm saying that not comforted ventures issue you got as you rightly point out yeah crops up fairly regularly yeah and it 's a matter of how you manage that you make sure that the decision-making process is appropriate talk about the decisions made concerning the trust not being able to be considered a recommended from the cheat committee on the grounds of Memphis the ring of the reason driven driven what remains given what remains counsel yeah I guess because it solves the because of the gravity that what remains years or so and what we 've got is entering into negotiation signing a lease agreement signing a transfer or an assignment of counsel facilities management contract and I think that are they the only two that remain the lease is so too well basically to ensure the new company becomes eligible for registrations are chips eleven point five point five thirty yep the assert the IRS working to sure that they get their the lease and I met facilities management yet so so if we go back to the resolution and approve the disestablishment of the housing management or defector from the date resolution approved that decisions remaining to be made concerning the establishment of the housing trust and end lease arrangements as another end what does that and other measures nice about it other matters you eps having a full stop after Kelton it 's wrong yeah deliveries are made by counsel all right yep so in that way it 's reported directly back to hear but I think I 'm also just of the process that 's going on at the moment as I think we actually need to confirm the counselor appointments on on the chip and I think it just gives them cover I mean whether we particularly agree with the process or not I think we have to do that because I don 't think it would be theatre them to feel that they were in any way exposed by the advice that we 've received so so who 's been appointed to the chip approved every year those three under group counselors back tuna and lonsdale is what do you trust these particular trustees over a auto turkey Community Housing Trust that 's good but in the information that we 've got it 's actually questioned the appointments process and we 're just cementing that no no we 're covering different human we 're confirming it so we 're going outside that original process to basis I should probably have a resolution that um it just states that this has been done outside of our normal as we normally do for these things we make reference to our well I what we 've done is confirm the appointment yeah I think so I mean it away another oversight it is yeah but you can say that with it doesn 't make any reference to the fact that we 're going outside of normal why do you need to do that because they hadn 't happened and I wanted to protect from it in this ok but no no no not like not unwilling to sort this out so confirm the appointments of counselors back tuna and lonsdale was trustees at the auto tawheed community trust in lighter note noting the advice that we have received because it doesn 't actually say it wasn 't in accordance with accountant I policy it says that it may not be no noting the advice received legal that that the appointment process may not have been in accordance was strictly in accordance with council policy we 're being asked my the appointments today yes that 's what the number three is doing we 've just basically been given a legs supplementary report to say yeah so I mean if we 're going us now today to say the places that we 've used to do that is this whatever that might be it 's not in accordance with our normal appointments policy as counsel that 's why I have no problem doing that it does just seem weird that we 're suddenly asked to make these appointments when they 've already been I 'm trying to cover for the fact that our colleagues are involved in a process of appointment next week and I 'm I 'm not comfortable to leave them exposed and not having a resolution and support of their appointments I agree like I 'm not arguing with you but it sure but just it 's just weird that we suddenly get a reservation to make appointments to something you already know the authority to someone else to make it 's not it 's not weird um shall we will evoke the existing appointments no we can 't but we 're not we didn 't have the power to make the appointments so I 'm just yeah but it 's a council we can state that we we we the appointments of councillors back to neurons dollars trustees of the auto tawheed Community Housing Trust notwithstanding the process that was followed how about that notwithstanding the process that was followed or leaving me acknowledging the recite and and notwithstanding the process that was followed I just I kind of want belts and braces approach I wouldn 't be referring back to the process to be honest I think what you had their first covers everything it doesn 't matter I mean it doesn 't it means that we 've been very clear about the fact that we haven 't got a final position on whether the process was adopted but we have to look to what it was with respect I don 't support something that refers back to the process that was followed I 'm sorry but that what you had up there was absolutely fine and I wouldn 't be referring to the process that was up there before because I think that 's making some assumptions and I 'm not prepared to support that sorry I 'm just confused what we 're trying to achieve today coverage for the fact that it possibly wasn 't an ideal process I don 't_''_1497.61 I don 't want anyone coming afterwards to say that that our colleagues are in any way not able to undertake the role that there and I think belts and braces is provided by the council supporting it and value sprint ice from staff okay right toyota out we don 't need that with processor shortly right okay so would someone like to move that question bill seconded by Glenn question put number three separately yep so I 'm going to put one in two I 'll put one on to all those in favor say aye as opposed they know that 's carried number 3 i 'll put that separately all those in favor say aye those opposed say no no no Rep Minji posed beyond the post as well and Ellie joints so you don 't have to tell the sun 's out and Yanni no no but it 's an unusual that we are trying to fix something and now we 've got people waiting again for any understanding why I 've 't sorry um no I understand perfectly why so that 's fine so that one 's carried as well and I will and can you just note that councillors Jones and mangie oppose the second it 's fine right so I think we 're up to lunch and if we could take a break and be back here at twelve-thirty you 've got a slightly shorter very good idea one city was _"

paper on this Delta source management system this is not one that requires a this is not one that requires a decision about you know being represented as an input into the local government New Zealand 's discussion on resource management and has a particular focus on the areas of continued improvement of the system improving the clarity of the course statutes within the resource management system and moving beyond evolution so would someone like to move that David seconded by ill do any discussion put that make Oh Richard don 't know that sorry that jump and I just did want to raise one matter and it 's to do with the counsel submitted on the resource legislation amendment bill and that when and some time ago but as you be aware the Canterbury mural forum was also seeking to larger submission and what you 'll find in your report is a copy yesterday I circulated to you a copy of the final submission on behalf of them now that submission is consistent with what we have said as a council and I realized it 's too late it only came in yesterday as too late to get any kind of cool move endorsement but I really just wanted to daylight that with you and I will have to bring it back to you at a later date to get retrospective approval so it 's just a matter of timing and the way that the organization is function that we only were in receipt of that yesterday so I did circulate a copy to you but I appreciate you probably haven 't had time to Rosita going you 're in the middle of everything so can we just then note this dodge by the urban development strategy implementation buddy in the canterbury murals form attachments and the Canterbury mayoral forum on a placeholder basis that once that business just put on here on a placeholder there was a placeholder the form part of the report that yet came to you for this mission on the formal submission of the counterfeiter citrus separate three note that a further report on the finalized can 't be mayoral forum submission will be provided in due course yeah yeah I think that 's all we can do a giveaway and it received it but but they are their intention is to Portland today so we I will need to therefore see which respect of improving your service here but it is consistent with what we were saying on that matter and yanni I just wanted to clarify it gets whether or not you think we 've made sufficient common and the right for people to be notified I mean given what 's been happening and we 've probably seen it through things like the statement of expectations the decision-making framework around giving people actually the right to be notified and makes and participate in planning and I think there was some there was some sort of small reference around around that on page two page 127 but it doesn 't really specifically talk it up notification then again was kind of concerned with the UDS one that rights for people to be involved particularly where they are affected it 's a different let 's on a different that 's on this limited edition missions inquiry that they 're all asking for slightly different things yeah Nia notes I mean it has been a little bit challenging having these three three things all happening at the same time but with this but they are going to produce they 'll produce a a adopt menteur ound the feedback from local governments throughout New Zealand and in and it 'll feed into the government processes so I mean it 's it 's probably not not a biggie but I wouldn 't have any objection to um if you look on page two my concerns really at that top where it says the council supports the proposed step program or performs and it just doesn 't really catch up or do it it says the alternative to a mess of rewrite from from day one because what what they 're looking at is this do you do you start from scratch or is it organic so we 're supporting the organic over again that 's on steps right so yes we 're just having something in there that made reference to UM supporting the revisions that actually enable people to participate and be informed will be notified because that 's really the direction where it 's been going all the little stick changes to the RMA having to remove people 's right to participate and really have a hands-off approach to supplanting and I just thought it would be good to have something in there that just made reference to that can we can we get in a line maybe internet at that and their introductory paragraph on that page to basically saying the council supports community participation and and planning that affects their local communities something along those lines arts it 's mean that the thing is affected you yeah I mean I thought I think there would be okay something along those lines it just has a phrasing around community participation because we know that having a more participatory approach to planning something we 're not really experiencing at the moment if it helps is on page through the is however the council would be concerned with the extent to which the suggested suite of new provisions may include mandatory plan provisions or reduce solution or appeal rights so it is pretty clear stevia that the council is seeking to retain the ability for people to make some mushrooms into larger peons I think it 's wider of it to me it 's wider than that it 's basically the professionalization of planning has meant that and the lack of notification has meant that people can 't participate so even if you 've got a submissions process like we 've seen with the hearings panel there 's a lack of resources and capacity at an individual level to really meaningfully and participate in those processes alongside the lack of notification so people that can afford to appeal to the High Court to do a judicial review of notification again but actually people that are directly affected sometimes won 't even have that opportunity so I personally like the mares suggestion that kind of just made the point that actually community participation and planning is actually a really important principle for people to be notified and participate we 've got those words and we can add them into the submission and Roger recording okay I just wonder as well in the section on page two about halfway done we talked about the value in the nation 's natural capital and I just wonderful slippery Stan bed a bit like surely the results navigate is about ensuring that things that browser and natural resources are actually retained and that that 's key to the whole resource management back rather than what we 've seen with the statement of expectation that development is terrible prices no matter what the environment of course yes we can add those words enough yeah that phrase maintaining Lehman per chip perpetuity would be also provide significant economic benefits seems like this original thing because that isn 't a sentence that makes you bother maintaining them in perpetuity what would also provide significant intergenerational benefits I mean it 's not just an economic benefits of antibiotics with environmental to its environmental social economic health cultural yeah well being you see that one that they were Brian grubber move out and a second or so i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried item number 17 proposed stopping of legal road even here they know so that is a lot of work for us and i just want to say we know that staff do some really really good or omission work no they don 't you know we appre appreciate it and while we can find to need efforts wouldn 't we 're in a hurry with their a new plane I know oh we can we did do and staff under pressure _"

    "text": "come off that motion all those in favor say aye I say no that 's scary thank you I some porcine far share an electric vehicle policy Oh yep sorry I look I should have highlighted on the last one that we actually did consider the issue of a report going to strategy and Finance and there 's another committee with the Met measure on its terms of reference in agreement between the chair of strategy and finance and the chair become automatic the measure may be referred through the other committee rather than strategy and finance so it 's sorted that out so now if there 's an item that comes to strategy and Finance and it 's more appropriate to Italy then it can be agreed with them regimens feel that it go to a tee but it 's a sensible good sensible price right cashier an electric vehicle policy who 's behind this report it was right over this come sorry whoops where 's george committee today chemistry you see i see so do you want to speak to it but when the drawer let 's pass for that i just wanna say I 'm really pleased staff have done this work on it edit it is right right at the cutting edge of air transport it so it 's a part of it in cashiering and the electrical vehicle thing and so it 's I think it 's really good that I 'm Council are you know right on top of the gum until their game with us but very good that can answer the questions well Vicki am my phone and I just think we need we need to Front for the looming future and the and really tape on board and actually encourage people to look at new ways of getting around what do you like cashiering like illiterate vehicles which are coming here fast and we know you want to do with it I mean we 're going to get behind us here and late and lead the study in turn into a new future sorry this allows us to actually put charging stations and cashier in business credit rate with that without having to suddenly go back and find rules and ways the only thing we now need to do is fill them up with a liquid pledges which is very target of by early next year at least five fast charging stations and the Christchurch greater crash criteria and the electric vehicles and then cashiering electric classes so this is the nice start and things right now we just need to love with a little bit yeah good Yanni oh yeah um yeah this is a start I thought we did have agreement at the committee that we would change it from the draft electric vehicle policy to something that reflected the the contents of it more accurately which is around actually the charging structures because it was discussed at the committee that anime be charging and parking but it was discussed at the committee that actually is a lot wider work to be done around in a literal vehicles policy for example council possibly acquiring electric vehicles work around electric buses said it with broader kind of goals around an electric vehicle policy for the council but at the same time but if i may just says war device is felt they didn 't need to be repeated in this way okay no that was it we 're in one of Jesus does say adopt the draft electric vehicle policy is a formal statement of position on the use of electric video asian of associated infrastructure on city streets I mean I think we 're probably splitting here 's to say that it 's not a policy there will be wider issues that we will continue to come back to there will be there will be perks and we can change the policy but so we have to have a policy should do you have a preference for any two circles this is actually that the strength you might assume that the only point I 'm making is on page 109 the heating of the policy is different to what for council commit all the committee counsel recommendation is so it 's right it 's correct it 's a problem statement on the position of the use of electric vehicles and insulation stated infrastructure no problem that 's great but when you read the heating of the policy it makes the City Council which it 's not really so that 's all I was just trying to clarify that so like just be the draft electric policy the electric vehicle haces will strap design streets yeah and that 's so well just what it says in the recommendation the use of electric vehicles and necessity well can we just use that as a tidy up I mean I idea there you can tidy up the wording of what it is online but yeah yeah and I wonder if that comments on this because he 's pulled it all together and can probably give us some good advice here so the what we 're trying to do with both of these policies is make them broad and enabling and not too prescriptive and so I think we might get it might sound like we 're getting a bit caught up in it and they 're hitting there but essentially what the when when we say we 're encouraging the use of electric vehicles in Christchurch the thing that the role that the council primarily will play is the restriction of parking on city streets going forward how the operational and business models change we may want with them there may be other roles that we can play so the policy or the statement of intent towards the recurring issue of of the use of electric vehicles and their role on the street has tried to will try to sort of encapsulate that and this policy by saying we encourage the use of military vehicles but today specifically the the primary role that council will be playing will be the restriction of parking spaces and and the instructional streets we are happy happy to change the heavy change the name of the policy to the structures on streets policy but the who have a policy for that within within the road reserved for things like retaining walls garages carports so this is me to sit alongside that be consistent with that adhere to those principles and adhere to insert alongside a range of council policies as well so it 's meant to sort of set and amongst a family of policies that council has that are outward facing to to sort of and by having that statement of position about encouraging the use of electric vehicles that broad sort of capture all is intended to help steer decision-making when when there are issues that we maybe don 't foresee today that arise will be able to sort of continue with that duration so ask you one question yep okay thank you we got into the job to cashier policy on 11111 the 3.1 policy statement 3.23 industry point of six this one I 'm not sure because 3-pointers three is kinda of focus on the council and also the costume organization reach and queen and sign up women plus three pointer six like the most cultural organization they need to apply for mr. dto whitening comes or proof so a little bit of confuse so with the with the with the car share policy the the the the end goal would be to have sort of a number of vehicles that would comprise a fleet some of those spaces may be designated for the vehicles on council land and they may they may strike up deals with private landowners to locate the us to be able to determine what is a legitimate activity of car sharing weird needs would need some sort of discussion in some sort of agreement to be formalized with the car sharing entity and the details and there would sort of be the reassurance we would need that we would be giving giving up potentially a parking space s consideration which is which is part of the sort of the broader public realm for something that is to be of the benefit of the board of public as well and so those those sorts of details would would would need to need to obtain from from the entity and so that 's just detailed in the policy that this wouldn 't necessarily be a given or some sort of free for all when we 're giving away parking spaces so just it 's just something I knew this would need to address on a case-by-case basis with each of the each of the potential car sharing entities okay thank you _"

    "text": "okay so i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye first I know that 's carried item number 13 and to section design policy review for people with disabilities who would like to move there our Phil seconded by cleaned is there any discussion Oh Yanni it 's um just I don 't if we have staff here for this but we just want to clarity around what feedback walls from the disability Advisory Group so it will retailers that they 've considered it but it would actually be good to know actually what their feedback was I should say that it 's very hard to read you know and I mean it is a bit ironic that we 're talking about disability guidelines and and we 've got something that you know for some people is actually almost impossible to read but I would be good just to know and this can just come back as a mere I don 't want to hold this up anymore but it would be really good to know what their disability Advisory groups response was to this policy well as they did and at the time they were considering it the disability Advisory Group was in transition some new members were coming off as you know yani and univ is coming on and it certainly has been discussed with the disability Advisory Group and overall they certainly had support the policy you write that in the report that 's not referred to but in fact they did discussion just as did the other disability advocacy groups like for example the Brian foundation yeah so the mva listed in the report so there was what I 'm saying it was clear discussion with that group and I have sought their assurance from staff I turn produce they are very poor when then turn let 's make it a lot i 'm a bullshitter slight amendment because there is a group that i met just recently and they come and present to the chewed committee on the 7th of april it called be accessible and if we 're wanting to be the most accessible accessible city in the world we 'll start leading in that direction there may be some guidelines us like most like a sixth green star rating it for a building this is the awaiting that cities will be rated upon and so I just wonder if some of that work will be fed into this this program here um does the two wanna staff wanna cut or shy just take tums cool because I 've got a man in Phil other what would it be a great help to us of Earth in the report that it was the feedback is included from little bit group and I don 't know why it 'll be the husband I was actually going to say that to the chief executive so that in future when we get reports can we actually have the feedback from the groups that we consult with so that when we consult with the disability Advisory Group that we actually say in the report the response the disability Advisory Group was x y&z because that gives us clarity over the consultation process as well yeah yes yeah I just buy the clothes Christian to look there has been informal discussions with barrier-free i think that 's not very fit so she 'd be accessible to sit say this why yes oh I 'm sure they could be included to pool and because what we is every reason for the different disability visor groups to be together but council will really get good advice area free no it 's not be accessible is but there 's a number of organizations in this very free is the organization who a number of council unit season 10 can probably tell us specifically I 'm not the umbrella group for all the pretty accessible as difference it 's just a organization that will write individual cities on actually how accessible out and very free did it if its many berra berra glass tinkling terrifying here in the preparation of the report the the blind foundation and disabled persons assembly were consulted over the detail of the report prior to that coming to both committees the the group that weren 't fully consulted over the content of the report were the with with the disability Advisory Group which was the query raised council two weeks ago I 've suit since told me that they were aware of the preparation of this policy and they were broadly in support of its preparation but they weren 't consulted over the detail of it and and from from that point of view there were their content with the content with the direction the policy is taking and and so I spoke to her about whether they wish us to consult further with them over the policy itself she didn 't believe that was necessary because they would actually like to be involved in how the policy is then delivered if council approve it today so it wouldn 't be fair to say they would consulted over detail of it but it would be fair to say they were aware of the preparation of it and were broadly in support of the policy I think I think a better process and the future would be to obviously make engage them and the process and then clearly the message isn 't it we want them engaged in the delorean our apologies for now it should have happened it will happen in future yeah but but that we can be clear yeah well in so um we 've got a mover and a seconder for this if we yes I know Phil and I thought I took the lead as you did at the pool no I thought

that Andrew tuna would like to move these amendments yes please he 'd way he did walk way give way we 're making headway here to hit walkway moving to Thailand we bring the scrubs where we can see what you 're looking at is wealthy just I 'll sorry I didn 't realize you in and the funeral block bury it blocked burials for full size plot the car park fee paid to the City Council for cost recovery for damage to two and child care facilities at Pioneer early learning center which is neither here nor there we no longer own the facility so it 's not it 's really could have been dealt with as an era I 've talked to the chief executive in terms of the schedule of fees and charges I think one of the lessons learned is that counselors in the governance earlier in the process we didn 't see them until they were just about due to go online so I I did note that there was a comment in the paper this morning about the funeral plot burials for full-size plots in terms of the level of increase that it represented but we 're not going to go out into the salt on that we want to actually review it before the 12 months so that we can really investigate and get to the bottom or button or so so if Andrew would like to move those i will just on that hotel midlife way to second it yep i 'm so happy to do that just on that head-to-head walk where i 'm wondering whether we could just clarify that one little bit more and just add the word something like program delivery or project delivery so if program delivery is technically possible or if project delivery yeah yeah yeah because it 's not about the technical possibility of moving funding except italian yes project delivery because it 's all about geotechnical work and the in the area yes reflects the reality that we 've been talking about in the earlier debate i think it 's truly reflective of where we 're at alright so there were two that the other that 's been moved and seconded so i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye would you like me to voice and no first men that is the reason we took the break or so we could feedback what the implications sorry I thought these ones were all advised by starfish oh and you 've been advised by staff around how some of that could move and we 've gone and look at the financial implications to make sure they 're okay all right other solid job you know it 's it 's a very complicated process and there 's no issues with either of these and they enter here can be covered off by carry forward and will flow through on the head to hit walkway and there is a slight increase in year two but within those realms of rounding and America cottage is also carry floored with an additional 120 which only two thumbs up cool all right oh no I 'm there 's no this this is no what a question because we 've had the advice back but we 've had no chance to ask the question based on their twice so just a really straightforward question when the Hagley Park coffee yeah watch the stuff of come back and said two dollars and I just wanted to know why we wouldn 't look at a higher level like three dollars so just is a two dollars to counsel in the car parking fee that the operator can charge as a maximum of five yeah and it 's it at that level so that actually the event organizer can actually pay their staff pay the check people that are looking after the car park so it 's a five dollar maximum three goes for the object of the car park and two comes to counsel and that as the only viable way of running otherwise you 've been talking either would it be all tech job a desire is trixie done appropriate car parts either hit a little part kinda to restrict the amount of car parking on heavy Park anyway so the two dollars survival charge can bet council with a maximum of 50 and I think that 's what I hoped would be intended but in fact the two dollars and see the Dalton would come back to council to cover those costs that have been referred to it and there is also some work being done on how in fact we need to reduce car parking on hagley park all together so to me this that fits almost like this I just want to know what I wasn 't hired yeah so i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye I say no that 's carried thank you very much and now we 'll move on to the to the notes below so and we 'll we 'll go through them one by one and if people have questions of staff and relation to each one of them so the first one is the wolf 's turn them would pull 38 k is allocated for the project for site investigation on 2016-17 internal planning you 've got a question on there well I had a separate amendment as well related to limit Boston Pops oh I don 't know whether you want to do it as part of that or you want to do it independently now these are notes about what what is what is doable so so I haven 't been sentiment any amendments yes before we get on to the limits then have we got a couple that if something can be done earlier yes yes I mean there is an assumption that if anything can be brought forward it will be you know with the projects ready to go it will be brought forward and I don 't know whether we want to have a specific set of words that actually say that I think it 's a couple of the isn 't an overarching provision there himself we need any project immunity because on the ombre 3lt pit or on the LTP will be brought forward if it is if it is possible I mean if the project is ready to proceed when the project is ready to proceed also to acknowledge that the Hagley firmament community board has identified a preliminary site for investigation which is not what the cinema consultation document so it 's it 's not a maid to change the consultation document but if you just makes reference to that progress but I still want to move the amendment that we actually put some budget on for this upcoming financial year and for next year it ok but so long I am we 've had visibility of that amendment from council johansson it was five million for next year and 15 million for the year after and what that would do the rates is 5.02 then 5.24 then 5.22 and 5.44 so it would be an increase to rates because of those those capital costs more importantly I think it is really around delivery you know when having the funding envelope being the constraint here or the rape it 's really around the ability to deliver the capital program and a space where we believe that the full 50 is already you know really tight and full capacity in Rob I believe you were checking we 've had the conversation then if things can be done yet they will be but Rob if you could talk to where we currently think that 's possible yes so the program as it stands has a construction commencing in towards the end of 2018 calendar year and then progressing through predominantly through 2019 it 's a new facility limited planning community engagement today so that project timeframes reflect that situation it 's great to hear that insight maybe potentially identified but that needs to be worked through together to to get the project up and running so I wouldn 't recommend putting it on the plan at this point and because of the rates because of the deliverability and because of the need to then flow through all the underlying documentation yeah um Paul is there enough money on the budget to do the work to enable the site selection the community engagement all the work that goes through to achieve make this possible sup of time the money is on budget we can stick a spade in the group yes i bleeding there is and some of will su start engaging with their community on this project as of the new killing you yeah oh ends work going on now and preparation for the pacific that 's really the issue here is we know it takes a couple of three years to get displayed on the ground anyway through the work but i wanna make sure that we 're actually engaging so the community knows that this project is actually started yeah and i think because there 's not a large construction going to happen in the new year if there was a requirement to bring forward and we be talking probably in the order of tens of thousands of need be it won 't be huge amounts in that having off by the conversation area we haven 't had a paper come to counsel you on the specific project so that 's that 's the first step so the council needs to receive a paper and I know that the heavy pyramid community board did make a particular recommendation in relation to its preference around site selection but we have to agree a site selection process a very particular process which actually involved a wider group of people the community board worked in collaboration with a wider group of people but given the circumstances there were quite different it may not be appropriate so I think that we need to kind of get people to put a wriggle on really in terms of getting that paper to council because it commences the process of developing the case for site selection and the process beyond that so I 've got fell and then anarchy look just from what staff have said and all along with that I guess we do need more information and so I think say an amendment or a yes but especially around site selection but it 's really a process for investigation of what is needed so I think in a minute that way would in fact ensure that we are the report would come back to Council well I think the note up their covers exactly that I think you 've also got to recognize that we are delivering the eastern all we are doing the home depot we 're doing a of results that we need to actually make sure that we get the right solutions for all of those because they are big projects and so this will be in fit in but we are able to start on that site selection we 're in the middle of talking to the moa about various options that there it 's not going to be I don 't think the solution is going to just drop out l-e-e-et 's but we have got exactly so we can progress through that and if we can clear all though so we can being potentially bring it forward as Rob said I can also add the project is getting extra scrutiny from the LT and that it 's on the watch list which is getting monthly scrutiny to ensure staff you know I i love this project i think it 's particularly exciting and so I 'm delighted with the suggestion that if it can be brought forward it will be brought forward so the challenge for the community board now is to go and do a whole pile of work and get that cracking making sure that the community knows this is a certainty and just they 're all that comment that council they would around what 's needed that we know what 's needed as a pool and it 's a complex that actually their community can enjoy and I think that 's some of the terminology that would get quite concerned about what is needed we know it 's needed we need to do the work head mentally and we were happy to do that work we 're doesn 't make sure that there 's enough money on the budget then we can do that work so when the stuffs when the thing is ready to go we sick display in the ground yannick yeah um thanks I think um it 's really important to ignore sit this has been around for 20 years and the need for it and also that the community have felt that you know throughout numerous processes in the past but with the woolston PO wing demolished and last week we had the whoops than gawa and the paper were actually really good you know allowed the a commitment to actually putting something back and they 've been wedding at least a decade if not longer around around that so you know I think it 's great the way ago that the need is to get it done but I am concerned about the signal that the current financial plan scenes and if it 's an issue of just putting more money into year two rather than having as much a new one that I 'm happy to amend it so that that 's the case but I personally can 't understand why it would take three years or four years as is proposed to get this complete and the idea was as we previously discussed they actually the synergy around the other pool projects it was much better possibly to look at cost efficiencies all actually doing some of them may be together so um I Murray adamant that we need to keep more than just forty eight thousand dollars on budget for this upcoming financial year because actually we need to send a strong signal that this is happening so efforts just to put three but yeah I just think the signal we seen by taking the money off budget and putting it out three years seems a really bad signal to the community that has actually been confronted and remember the schools that came in last year to the LTP and we 're critical of it being done in 1819 even so this community is facing a huge amounts of challenges with the mental health with the social deprivation with the huge changes that are going on they 've just had that escape more expand with a non notified consent they 've had residential intensification signaled they 've had a quarter of the park or a third of the part taken up with a tepee village and I 've seen no positive investment by the council into facilities to deal with that increases that have been happening so I personally just think it 's really important that there is some money significant money on budget for the next financial year I mean if you just think of the cost of consultants on a number of these other projects for the a thousand doesn 't to actually get work done let alone the remediation of any possible site well engaged Isis Isis is pretty clear and the money on budget does not deliver the project and we don 't believe we can deliver it faster we if we can we will so putting money on budget that we have to wait for for something we can 't deliver I don 't think as a good outcome for the community the trouble was is that we be had a process by which i mean i haven 't hadn 't seen this amendment it wasn 't sent to me so the the process was that if we could you know bring things forward we absolutely would make it as an overarching commitment but we agreed right from the get-go that we were going to pop ends on budget we couldn 't actually deliver that was the whole philosophy that stood behind the review of the capital program and it it necessarily means that we 've got to look at where projects are infect up to and I know that wolves done animal would have been after a to get a pool I mean this been a real dearth of facilities in their area so it does need to be resolved but it doesn 't fix it to put the money on budget but what I 'm hearing from staff is that they 'll have to go back to the Audit Office and get a whole new ordered as a result of this change so is that right this is a belief smells just there 's 48,000 enough to do the route we need to do i don 't i think i agree honey I don 't think 48,000 we spent sixty thousand dollars in solving change I limiter cats consultation on the summer scope car sewing 48,000 is not going to go very far so that 's the question I 've got have we got enough on budget you can see that there will be additional funding available through objects so that said the money 's there to do the consultation and the project site investigation the money 's there presumably the site investigations to make sure it 's not bad land it doesn 't have to investigation we 've got money on budget to decontaminate the it 's an old nursery side so but that 's not the site yani that 's not fair community needs to be engaged in a whole conversation about whether that is the appropriate site so I mean it 's not yep I think you 're jumping ahead of where you 've got to I mean I think it 's a shame that you want to move this amendment and light of our agreed position that we wouldn 't put things on budget that we couldn 't deliver garand will not guarantee but that we weren 't going to be able to necessarily deliver because of where the project was up to I mean carryforwards are just as devastating to people because there 's an expectation raised that things are going to be delivered and thin though they 'll smash down again well I think we can do that Miss project within two years I can 't leave any good reason why we can 't look Spencer over Jason the floating from two years putting it up to four years to you take other projects oh I have we don 't have deserts going to count so happening is I 'm going to give to border is an amendment yeah and if it stands it stains yeah it means that we put it rust the time frame for our can I out Alton p consultation can I just suggest we 've got an overarching and thing that if we can do things faster we regularly community facilities we were you know we only want to make the lynnwood washington paul happen because we understand the deprivation and eggs and what it is in around Linwood and having worked in the lynnwood schools I understand it totally so we want this to happen there will be ways in which you can bring it the board that don 't involve staff time and they 'll probably involve a design-build solution once you 've consulted the public on where their site goes so I think we can achieve the outcomes that your community board wants and that the council wants within the context of the current budget because we know that we 've got soon as the community board had found a site consultant public and then come back with a shorter term solution then I think we start talking about we 're we 're well said can I just add to that we 've got at least one project an hour would be similarly keen to move forward but after discussing it with staff and and of course what you 've just said is entirely one hundred percent true and correct so it 's just a shame that this is holding know that this is this this this can all be resolved before June you know what I 'm saying if this project is capable of advancing within the time frame we can move it forward beach into the editors but it 's doing it at the end of the line which is why I was trying to say that this is the beginning of the process of the public engagement I mean are we going to seriously put it on budget and then have no one from them were booster and come along and make representations to their community board and then _''_1269.68 would it be better but we actually front end is the desire to get the information together so that we can actually make a decision by the beauty of concern about what is in fact going on budget because we know then what 's deliverable in that time frame Andrew thank you um I mean I totally understand where the two counselors for the water coming from and I totally get the the interest of the community in this and the interest of the community board in this and the desire to get this underway mean what we 're actually talking about is delivering the pool as quickly as possible and really a lot of this conversation is about showing a commitment to the community that we are delivering the pool as quickly as possible as well and where the funds appear on budget is one way we can show that commitment but there are other ways of doing it as well so I mean in terms of bringing a paper to council around starting the consultation process with the community and working out a process which is fast-tracking this paper worked up and brought to council that pebble wave will come through young basically the parks and reserves great pride in conjunction with one so look I would have to go and have to John and Darren and just see where that gun stream of workers what we 've given an undertaking to staff has we 've said do not stop work on any of these projects continue them as fast we can because we 've also said that it is possible to bring money forward if these advanced of the resource consents if the land consultation goes a lot smoother than possible but in the past what we 've found is so supposed to be longer than what they have and so what we 've tried to do is put a realistically deliverable project so we are going to do things as quickly as possible I can 't John 's not hearing some and endures Darren so I can 't actually differently let you know what that timetable is but they are working on letters quickly or so possible again how about this additional wedding request staff this price the final adoption of the annual plan and June on the deliverability of early deliverability of projects so that this can be taken into account and this year 's annual plane oh okay request staff to provide advice price the final adoption of the annual plan and Joan on the early deliverability of proteins including the woolston number at all so that 's making it explicit around then one yes but I mean that 's that 's that 's an anointing provisions so do you still want to put your amendment no that 's fine i mean if we get that but on but i think the signal needs to be really clear that we are committed to actually doing it and that if we can get the advice back because the message that 's gone out even with the proposed draft consultation document is that with the presentation document hasn 't gone out no the proposed one which is in public so we 've already had the negative feedback from the community board over the feeling of you know at being pushed it up I think the message to doing it as soon as possible they 've got a process underway I think what one thing to note is there 's a number of other projects that don 't get reports that come to council that just kind of happen because money is on budget and maybe what we need is actually a bit of price is around how these projects actually get initiated and work continues because at the moment i feel usually mustache because there 's no money on budget work as not just it 's not just projects yeah but we we make decisions during the LTP process and in what happens the biodiversity partnership I 'm enough I 've lost sight of it I don 't know what 's happened to it you know same truck moment there are all sorts of things that come up during the LTP process that I don 't feel like we 've got a tip lyst approach to how they then get four groups so and this is probably one of those as well because it was added to the LTP you know by way of amendment without we when we undertake these processes we just have to accept that there 's a bit of a consequence which is how do we then drive the work program to ensure that it 's delivered and that 's kind of learning as we go I 'm afraid I think it needs to be consistency around project so Victoria Street which is that spending on I agree there but it 's not move on to another system lock in other priests let 's go down to the let 's go back to the lust so what 's the next longest the next one is the governor 's budget duty which has no change to the annual plan however the council 's contribution can be brought forward to align with the community fundraising as the project progresses and that 's been communicated yeah it has an I 've had some communication with staff around this my understanding is the letter has been sent to the jetty trust an indication has been given to me that the jetty trusts are comfortable with the contents of that letter I mean again this is really this project we appreciate that there might be some some timing issues around it or they may not the important messages that we retain the flexibility to bring funding forward to match the community contribution as soon as that concert community contribution is ready to be matched so on that basis I 'm happy with that the jetty trust are fully capable and fully yeah involved in this project and I 'm sure if they 've got any further comment they 'll be making a submission in coming to as part of that submissions process so on the basis of the advice I 've received uncomfortable with this right the new brighton legacy project is is there because that 's called learning the lesson of last year when if you 're not explicit in the capital program you better tell people that the fundings actually in place and a an appalled and awaiting a business case so the money is on budget it moves these crystal-clear money tokens on blogger worker there at the time to strike so they are gonna work on it yeah zombie I 'm Ishmael street there are going to have to be further investigations take place to ensure that issues raised our addressed do you want to speak to that Rob I think yeah it 's that 's great that it sits at a program level it 's hard to pull out I think council you 're handsome telecom table or or Chris Gregory and there was a concern around where it sits as an order of priority so I think come back that we we just need to document the fact that it will be picked up as a matter of priority within a program that 's for them the annual plan next so I 've moved an amendment as well on that so the problem is that the response that has come back so we don 't have a list of Street renewals but the response has come back that the street in your budget is at capacity and it 's fully allocated but we don 't know what streets have been allocated by man and we 've got a strike that 's got four different types of kerbin channel that 's flooding and it 's just had its skirt repair so I don 't know what process we have as counselors they actually get stretched added to the renewal program where we see a community need and I 'm still a little bit unclear so I personally want to explicitly solution that this one does get added to that program liberal budget even though we don 't know what other streets are in it I was happy to offer substitutions but I can 't do that because I don 't know what 's in this one so but it 's not a huge cost and it would actually you know I think should be a priority so well I mean the challenge for me in terms of being able to support an amendment of this nature is that that I 've got nothing to base it on you know so I mean again this is one that 's easily able to be picked up and worked on over the next six months I mean we 've had months on the capital program and I think it is really important that if we 700,000 isn 't it so given that that 's a substantial sum of money it 's not it 's not something that you can just put on by itself because as you say something else has to come off and no that isn 't your function to do that we 've got a priority process and it is something that we need to have visibility of but we can do that over the next six months is no more months where are we march april may june three months and we can get it done by then but i can 't see that i could support putting a street ahead of other streets in pushing a street down when I don 't even know what the effects are materially weeks we 've got grain street in our water which was the next trade off the block just before the earthquake dad waited 15 years for that to be done up they had gone and on and on now if we 're going to go straight go straight i 'm sure every counselor this table could put up 15 to 20 this noisy this was no justice ago this is a draft this is a raft plane that 's going out for consultation i said no emphasis in specific your plan and it 's going out you know i mean it the truth is is that we 've got you know i mean it is a we 've gone through an entire review of our capital program i mean it 's it 's never going to be perfect it 's either going to be ideal but what we 've done is the best that we can under the circumstances and i think that we really do have to trust it after come back to us with details between now and June this confirm part of the annual plan nothing is going to change between now and the thirtieth of June in terms of the work that 's going to be done in this area so so why not just wait until we 've got the final plan to sign off I 'm a nervous ignorant we 're going round in circles we will understand that all most of us do could to the jar plan so you wanted I 'm not denying your right to do it so you would like to move data mean monthly and who 's sick and dying Utley g-list all so i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no no that 's lost thank you thank you so but we will continue to reference Ishmael street and the context of the noting provisions can we get a list of the schools that are programmed so we actually know which has been _"

    "text": "I just thought that I 'd say a couple of words at the outset around process for dealing with draft end of annual plan and like I guess as agreed due to the significant amount of work that we 've already done in workshops and staff have gone away and worked on for us this morning the council will debate the proposed annual plan and amended ltp but i have to say we have to get the flume right in order to comply with our friends that key at the office of the auditor general and their representatives here in christchurch so this means that when we just when we have decided on any amendments to the annual plan and or a member 's LTC we need to take a break and this break is really required for our finance team to analyze the impacts of any changes and communicate and discuss these with audit New Zealand so we 're going to have two breaks during the course of this part of the meeting and I 'll come back to that the second one the first one after this F material changes then they will be able to receive what 's called the letter of representation which has already been signed by us and produce their audit opinion we can then attach the audit opinion to the consultation document and council can formally resolve brick recommendation 5 which is to approve and adopt the consultation the consultation document including the audit New Zealand report I think it 's wise that we avoid changing the consultation document it if we can possibly do that as changing that will mean audit Musil and we 'll need to reevaluate it or revalidate it really and respected the order of proceedings for today 's meeting the council needs to adopt the information that is relied on by the content but right relied on by the content of the consultation document in which provides the basis for the amendment the floor the council adopts the consultation document we are reminded that we need our own league advice so Ian Thompson will be at the ready to satisfy itself that the adoption processes comply with the strict requirements of the local government to act 2003 but by local authority in relation to long-term plan and consultation document before adopting a consultation document under section 93 a the local authority must prepare and adopt the information that a is relied on by the content of the consultation document adopted under section 93 a and is necessary to enable the Auditor General to give the reports required by section 93 c 4 and 93 d 4 and provide the basis for the preparation or amendment of the long-term plan so that is why I will need to take two breaks in the process so that any proposed resolutions can be vetted by our legal advisers as well that being said we did call for advice on amendments that counselors proposed and for the purposes of the debate the following amendments can be assumed will be moved a reprofiling of the head-to-head walkway returning manuka cottage to the program bringing forward woolston pool site investigation and in terms of fees and charges no fee increase in funeral plot burials for full-size plots for a further 12 months while further investigations are taken increasing hagley park car park fees paid care facilities of Pioneer early learning center which recently i think is an error in admission and mission and could have been dealt with that way we provided overnight information on other matters which were not supported by staff recommendations but we hear of us for analysis to be undertaken which can be fed into the process this is a draft and we 're going out to public to invite their feedback so the process will be just a brief opening statement from me or I will formally move the that the resolutions as they sit on the on the agenda but with the yeah but what the view that we will take a break after the debate and we will get the resolution into the final form we will then have a debate with counselors participating up to five minutes each and then we 'll take that first break deal with any proposed amendments agree a position on amendments subject to finance clarification on impact and then the second break will occur while they undertake the work that they need to undertake and to communicate with ordered but at back to other items on the agenda and we can come back to the voting on the draft and Finance will then be able to provide detailed assessment of changes in any required updates to the recommendations of supporting information and Finance will have a discussion of the impact of these with audit New Zealand if that is a material and audit New Zealand 's opinions the council resolutions were able to be approved at that point so the reason I wanted to spell that out in some detail is that you know sometimes we think that it would be a good idea to move an amendment at this stage in the process and I guess that the risk is is that then that requires order to go back through an analysis of the impact and actually either require a full audit review or review the council position on amendment so I 'm just making that clear that this is at the beginning of a process that it is a draft that 's going out for public engagement all of the community boards will be invited on to make the undertaking so there is a quite a long way to go at the point that we have a resolution carried that satisfies those requirements then we continue through the balance of the meeting and then we take a break for Easter so right so on that basis could but I you know formerly move the resolution is set out on the order paper for item number or just I 'm looking at it in front of me but I 'm on my Hou page why not see what number toggle air page 11 26 yeah I know any status leisure right item 26 I 'll move the staff recommendations but that that is for the purposes of the debate and thats it ended by yeah I 'm happy back so I 'll just make I only want to make a brief introductory comment because I 'll speak of the that the end I think that for me we we 've got to what this draft plan is is very much what we said we do at the conclusion of our long-term plan process last year we said that we would we brought an external advisory committee an expert advisory committee I was interesting a comment was made in the media the other day about the the cost and all of the people that contributor to that donated their time because they felt that it was important that they assisted the council with that external review and I think bringing fresh eyes to a council organization has been an extremely positive process and i would like to acknowledge and thank roger bridge getting more corn bolstad bob blood and the sarah and skirt officials that joined with them in order to undertake that analysis and i 'd also like to acknowledge that the chief executive also played a very important role by bringing in an external person into the council as part of a really a priority decision or somebody who was capable of helping the organization lead what is in fact a priority setting process and that has been incredibly helpful as well and provided a very strong but important interface between governance and management and I feel absolutely confident going forward that as an organization we are going to where we can bring projects forward because they are ahead of schedule the money will be there to be brought forward to enable them to be delivered and I couldn 't have said that one year ago but i feel like i can say that today so i really think the organization does need some recognition for what has been an extraordinary shift over a very very short period of time but this is exactly what we said we 'd do we knew that when we went out the consultation on the long-term plan last year that we were going to have an enormous challenge the explaining to people that the only things that we could put in our plan with things that we could substantiate to the office of the auditor general and that meant that we had to be able to put an put in the value of our assets because we knew that we would have to be able to rely on it we couldn 't put the insurance settlement because we didn 't have the insurance settlement we did put an assumption but actually that assumption 've actually received from our insurers and that has put us in a much better financial position then we were 12 months ago we also have a settlement with the crown over the horizontal infrastructure that I wouldn 't describe myself as particularly happy with the result but it is what it is and as a result it 's confirmed it 's settled it 's that 's that 's the position that we have ended up on and what that means is that we can go ahead with confidence knowing exactly what our financial position is and when I reflect on the first annual plane that we did sitting around this table having been elected in October 2013 and not knowing what our financial position was not realizing how much had been signed up to a negotiating agreement and in fact not realizing all of the hooks that were in that cost sharing agreement until we were elected and then finding out that the insurance recoveries hadn 't progressed fast enough and been finding out that the horizontal infrastructure spend had been grossly overestimated by our own organization you know standards would change in a way that didn 't represent in my view the best practice of working collaboratively together on a solution rather than one party taking a position and adopting us and advising the other party so we 've had it we 've had a hugely challenging to in a bit years but we 've come a long way and I don 't want to underestimate the strength of an organization that has managed to turn itself around in such a short period of time so that 's all what I wanted to say by way of introduction this is the plane that we said that we would introduce after our long term plan and it is in a much better space than it was we are in a much better space than we were we 've managed to lower the rates increase to a cap of five percent for the next three years we 've managed to spread our capital program not not so much that it places a infrastructure at risk but actually puts us in a better place so that we can prioritize and bring delivered rather than a wish and a prayer which is the way that we have done things to a certain extent and in the recent past so or yeah well that um that the suggestion is is that I move the amendments and notes at the same time so that they are all dealt with on that and the same resolution but obviously we 'll still take the break after the after the debate so will it rather than rather than ask people to put up their hands I 'm just wondering if we should just go around the table is just a procedural question oh okay okay all right um I was waiting on others but I do take responsibility for the lateness on ultimately my two amendments I have had staff advice in the positive so I 'd like to ask whether i could put those two amendments over to now and one I 've had a conversation with Andrew and yep I can feel insufficient confidence to download it in the night yes that they 're not committing us it costs right now obviously but to investigate the notes as the advice that I 'm receiving they can live a bit thank you yeah um Andrew thank you um I know the head-to-head walkway amendment and I just like to get a little bit of further information on that if I can around a level of certainty that if there is work that can be done in the next financial year that we will bring those funds forward in order to enable that work to be done because my understanding from staff is that there is sufficient work to be done in order to to spend the budget that originally was in the long-term plan for that year so I 'm certainly interested in the rationale if pushing front of those when my understanding is that the work is actually able to be done as planned so what 's the reason for pushing that out in view of the fact that I 've been advised by the staff closest to the project that they can deliver sorry that we 're going to debate the whole thing will come back to the amendments when we when we get have an adjournment and sort out the detail of the amendments so what so the opportunity to question around the amendments comes when I 'm probably after the break yep we 're just going to debate the other buyer you know that the CD and the financial strategy and that okay so this is debate and then questions come after yeah we agreed this early on the way that we would to structure the day that we would debate the going out to consultation on the annual plan and the amended LTP we wouldn 't have a consultation document if we weren 't amazing the LTP we would just be having an annual plan process the consultation document arises because we are mending their LTP as a result of the review of the capital program so that 's really the that 's the nub of what we 're going out to consider the process point of view we 're debating first then raising questions and if there are further amendments that we put it that second stage as well if the amendments need to be tied it up then they up is moving them just for the sake of getting the debate you know I 'm sure you okay yeah sorry so apologize from under sundar standards so from a debate point of view the most notable part of this annual plan as has been said is the changes that it makes to the long-term plan and in an environment where we 've got a far greater level of certainty than we had this time last year when we were putting out the long-term plan for consultation the insurance is now settled we 've got uncertainty around historical around the horizontal infrastructure but more particularly the review of the capital program has taken place and I 'm really pleased but as a council we 've been able to respond so the concerns that were expressed by summit this time last year regarding the deliverability of a large capital program some would say an impossibly large capital program and the work done by the capital review working group has really informed this along with a lot of work that 's been done by staff and advice from staff as well and a far more realistic view of the capital program and it 's deliverability and not only are we able to do that we actually have done that we 've really interrogated that capital program and looked at where things can and cannot be delivered and the thinking is certainly not around whether we can afford to deliver its whether we actually are capable of delivering so whether there are consenting issues that might delay a project or whether they 're our capacity to build issues that might delay a prod where indeed there 's an opportunity to consult with the community that needs to be taken which may mean that a project isn 't able to be delivered in line with its some original timelines I 'm pleased to see that there remains a strong commitment to provision of community facilities and rebuilding the clinical facilities and I 'm particularly pleased to hear that there remains flexibility within this budget to bring funds forward to meet the community expectation and to meet community and demand for facilities if it turns out in fact that we are able to deliver more work that 's been done with the plan so in short I think it 's great that we are fully committed to continuing to deliver community facilities to delivering a good standard and equitable standard of roads and footpaths throughout the city and that we 're doing that in a far more realistic way that ties in the capital program as it appears on paper with what 's actually capable of been delivered there is a course a link between that and the financial strategy the People 's Choice counselors have always taken the view that we we oppose the sale of assets so I 'm particularly pleased to see that there 's no requirement for a capital release in the next financial year and are also pleased to know that there 's work been done by CC HL that will inform the future view of capital release noting in particular that capital release doesn 't necessarily mean the sale of assets and that there may well be options to release capital from the balance sheets of the companies that council those through see CHL without actually needing to sell of these things are moving in a direction that I 'm increasingly comfortable with so I welcome this going out for consultation i also am pleased to see that there are a number of ways that the community can engage with the consultation process this time particularly around the involvement of the community boards and arguably more accessible opportunity to engage with the consultation process and using technology in order to allow that to happen as well so there will be aspects of this draft annual plan that the communities will have strong views on and I absolutely welcome hearing those views and been able to respond to them when we come back to finally debate this before we adopt up okay thank you I 'm very pleased to see what 's in front of us because it looks far more like a Christchurch City Council but I was familiar with the borrowing doesn 't look nearly as scary and the ratio you look nearly as scary as they did for the last couple of years and I like the fact that what the what this does is put prioritization is at least foot paths and roads that work in areas that have been hardest hit I think that 's really good I also like the fact that we 've put a very real emphasis on community facilities which is great and if we look at what 's actually in the annual plan just looking at Paul 's from Sam a new Southwest Paul and and also a new Southwest library qe2 woolston metro center and some salt water salt water pools and Brighton as well and emphasis on libraries and community facilities and things that bring the community together because we always have to remember and one of the challenges of local government is are always remembering that actually at the heart of local government is people rather than roads and pipes I 'm delighted that the borrowing ratios are not nearly as scary as there were there still a bit scary in my mind and but I feel like we 're gradually getting to the point where councillors resuming control and I look forward to a great deal more of that and happening in terms of a capital of the strategic assets personally I don 't think we need to we 've listed Orion Airport and what 's the other one the as a strategic assets are newer there 's another one over in littleton and and if we look at how we could put some get onto those and take more dividends from them I think we can easily reach the targets that we 've set ourselves which have been reduced from 750 million to 600 million over a longer period of time without actually selling any of those key strategic assets and I 'm delighted by that I think there 's also some really important environmental initiatives and here that I really like obviously the cycleways may take a year or two longer but we get them we get separate cycleways so that you actually feel safe and cycling say footpaths and obviously an emphasis on walkways noting that your head-to-head one we 've actually gone out for public consultation on the non-use of roundup because we think that 's not a sensible thing to do in terms of using it and also a real emphasis heath cut particularly which is nowhere near what a river should look like and christchurch and we have put a very strong emphasis on cleaning it up even though some people may think that that 's against job and so it is important that we do all of those things so I like our emphasis on earthquake repairs on community facilities bringing the community together not selling our key strategic assets which is how I interpret our program of capital release and on environmental initiatives so I 'm really pleased to see Edith yeah thank you thank you Paul and I had the pleasure of attending a local reasons group meeting AGM just a few days ago and of course there 's a lot of information and the infrastructure strategy the financial strategy the draft annual plan the long-term plan the consultation document but when you actually try and explain what it is that we 're doing I think the best place to start is on page team of the consultation document priorities for a capital program repairing and rebuilding facilities and communities most effective data earthquakes reducing the flooding reaffirming our commitment to the eastern suburbs so outcomes and livers of service even across the whole city ensuring communities have good social infrastructure so people feel safe and involved key facilities of libraries rec centers and pubs prioritizing their periods of our streets payments and curving across the bourbon areas particularly for the worst affected communities and areas prioritizing spending on water quality including protecting our groundwater and raising the quality of our urban rivers and prioritizing suburban regeneration and the most earthquake affected areas were balancing the suburban and central city projects and I think that gives a really nice indication of where this council is proposing to go through its draft and your plan and given the significant changes to our financial strategy and and possibly to our infrastructure strategy I think that 's a really good starting point to try and explain in simple English what we 're trying to achieve I think we do need to reflect on what 's happened and the concerns that were raised last year which we 're really around with if we had enough prioritization around the community versus the people told us through that process was that they saw that actually linking investment the social outcomes was important not just to economic ones which was seen as the driver behind anchor projects they also talked about rebuild aspiration verse community need central government need verse community need the priorities vs social recovery needs the loss of community facilities with commercial projects and the need for council to better advocate to government on behalf of the community and I think this consultation document this proposal really signals a change to the direction that we did last year and that was based on the uncertainty a lot of people were critical of the uncertainty but I think fundamentally we 're in a much better place there is no need to sell off assets we 've had increased growth we 've had the insurance payout which is being a positive from a financial point of view and also gives us the flexibility to deliver we 've got better financial performance of our council own companies so the companies that we were considering selling off are actually ones that are performing performing well a real plus and also the reality is that as was pointed out last year but really important we 've just had the chief executives update for this month 's council meeting we 've got a huge amount of carryforwards so this plan is really aiming to address that significant carry forward I do think there 's some challenges ahead and that includes the infrastructure theory and although we 've sorted out the horizontal infrastructural review and actually what 's happened is we 've gone from initially councils financial strategy was based on repairing and renewing the infrastructure to a bit of standard resilient infrastructure that was changed to like for like an hour in the situation where we 've got less for like so we do have a challenge around the infrastructure and hopefully communities or on the being the brunt of those changes can actually engage in this process and make it clear over where the priorities are so there 's a number of things in here that actually I don 't support but I think the really important thing is that we lit the community have a that the community can comment on rather than withdrew some of those things now so and some of the amendments I 'll make reference to that I think it 's really important that we do get more certainty around what streets will be renewed and when I am balanced against the expenditure in the central city but fundamentally I think the goal of this council should be in the goal of this size change significant change to our long-term plan is about how do we create a more modern dynamic sustainable healthy and beautiful city and when you look through the priorities I think this document goes a long way to doing that and I think it 's to be applauded so I 'd like to propose some amendments but I know now 's not the time to do that but fundamentally I think this is about making choices around our priorities as a city and as a council and I think that page 10 of the consultation document sets up up really clearly ok Glenn ok thank you thank you thank you to all the staff who put this as well the collegiality around that I really hope that people hone in on this document especially and including with three point four point one in the document which talks about this plan difference significantly from the LTP LTP I think those words in a way coming through quite understated it more than differs significantly in my view for the reasons which my colleagues have outlined already the insurance settlement being 80 million dollars over the ten-year capital program reduction to 146 million 750 down to 600 over capital release reduced need to borrow higher growth expected in the city 's racing rating based their others under deliverability is a huge part of this this really gives rise to me over big questions over why we ever would contemplate going down the path of esset sales the Auditor General came back and said that actually you had to have that fall back but I think if they they remake position to cast the arise over the whole public sector and Christchurch they would have seen that every one was behind in terms of the rebuild in the city they would that that 's amplified in an earthquake rebuild time where everyone is going frantically to build back but actually I cut they can 't build back as fast as they 'd like that 's fundamentally due to planning I 've got three things I want to quickly show you and I will stick to my time so the first Dwayne majors on the Left I cut remember the other guy 's name there 's only because I know that go on the left look at what this did the New Zealand in terms of public ownership I 'm not sure how you measure this in some countries they have a a happiness ometer or something like that New Zealand is kind of eccentric and individual enough to take on that measurement in future but look at what they did for our country in terms of retaining something and public ownership there 's a kind of dividend that is palpable it may not be able to be measured in financial terms or actually it could be but look what they did for our country I 've got another one next and this is about the flag now flying again at the cenotaph to leave item one of our companies came to the rescue without charging the rnc the local MP got the flag but one of the companies came to the rescue to have it Clegg put up that they fix the pole that had been vandalized they did some welding they didn 't charge that that 's a kind of a dividend tague which could be measured and financial as well as social terms the mix here here we go someone doing some dredge it not bridging that 's weedeating in the river again one of our companies is involved in a citywide cleanup of our two major rivers on may the 7th the total cost will be in the region of ten thousand dollars which we hope to find somewhere either in the current operational or grants or somewhere 10,000 they won 't be charging the only charge will be for the skips to pick up the rubbish we 're also you 're going get that social dividend and I would argue actually financial different but through ownership and I 've got the time lifting I don 't need those sites anymore just over the residential red zone you will know that I 'm not promoting the fixing of the pages road bridge there being some furious argument over there I 've had some conversations with staff and if it is the case that that 's due to a hold up over the residential red zone although spoon of equity design that bridge did we need to get on with consultation over the red zone many of the groups in the community have already begun that process I don 't see a need to duplicate it so it 's my intention to go out and have a conversation with those groups to double check are you ready to get going i think our community I suspect we 're ready but I need to double check with them and and to ensure that we get the process going in terms of regeneration I 've sense a lot of political support to actually get that legacy project up and running a new brighton and if we can come back with some at what signaling investment did for property values and the east of Christchurch in recent times that was due to the council room and that was a big front pager it would be good of those values in terms of increase was sustained but look at what we can achieve together if we work in partnership with the ministry and others to you know give the site of the city of huge pieces so those are my two main things today the two amendments I 'm putting up I think our deliverable and I hope to have your support those later on he and Paul I 'll be briefing the points I playback like five minutes but I 'd first like to actually think and Craig you regulate the staff for worked up down on the draft annual plan and issue today able to make it considered an informed decision when accepting it draft on your plan that we have in front of us today make sure you are looking forward to here with Mack beyond their views and thoughts in relation to this draft annual plan I 'm also and developing and sitting the long-term plan direction as provided some good news for Christ 's Church has enabled while boring lower rate increases and the delay in the capital release program we 've heard today obviously that that has concerned a number of members and a number of people out there in the community so this has given us time to consider more innovative ways we can fund our future boring now these change the largely due to high growth rate than was expected within our city 's rating base an 80 million dollar greater insurance pay up it was budgeted for through the long-term friend obviously the major contributor to this good news was insurance settlement prior Christmas delivering an 80 million dollar increase to what was budgeted for now and our long-term plan I 'm also pleased see we 're taking a more realistic approach through a careful program but also mindful have a lot of work to do in the space if there 's any ways we can speed up that would continue to look for ways we can actually make this happen because I think in Edwards for the risk is done on our great for Christchurch program which appears to be over delivery continuing to streamline processes and continued prudent financial management of our operational expenditure I 'm certain we 'll deliver greater savings without the loss of quality of service however I would like to ask that we ensure we 're holding our contractors accountable and that we are delivering what we are paying for will often get complaints about the state of our roadside gardens queens and the median strips and I think these are things that we address by actually putting a lot more pressure on our contracts to do to make sure that delivering what they later gotta deliver and I think will go a long way to actually ease and some of those complaints we get we are going to say that we 're pushing a lot of projects that could be delivered earlier and i believe the council should consider maybe a floating legacy fund that will be a more prudent move especially considering an ever-changing environment that we are dealing with which have consistently throws up opportunities so that was something i 'll be looking at moving but later however i 'm happy to approve today 's draft and your plan and looking forward to engaging our community and thanks thank you um I have to say I 'm very very pleased to see the document in the state that it is now and how hard everyone on it I from the start though have been very wary of suggestions and direction that puts business as usual work on the back burner and prioritizing with earthquake damage and repair I 'm not saying that earthquake damage and repair shouldn 't be a priority but if putting be a you work on hold things that are key to the amenity and our certainty to the smooth running of things in our city is because of a political fear of backlash if you like and realizing more capital Inari 's assets and support of that we have never ever ever suggested that there should be a sailor strategic assets and I totally reject their coming from some of my colleagues this morning its capacity that is the issue and resources to do the work then there is little point and pushing for some of the work that we have done in the past I would like to give credit to all of the staff and the elected members who have worked incredibly hard and long hours to achieve the really best outcomes for Christchurch and I congratulate them for that thank you Oh Jimmy yeah in principle I supporter for the our public consultation with a consultation document for the drafter any print 2016 and 17 and some other relevant documents how a one particular concerns anger issues the first one you know sauce waster the laser center in the new home be service center in the library because as a local councillor you know you will you do the consultation document particular on page that you Devon highlight the criteria of priorities were kept for program repairing or rebuilding facilities in a community most affected by the quick and also in a long term print the southwestern Asia center was Seeger to open in meet a 2018 in the new home be service center library where the open preneur expected contraction will start in the second half or 2070 which means after that you 'll I of 2017 solar cell facility due to open in 2019 pallet regarding the budget you know the change he popular will be the open in June of 2020 so my concern is the first not compliant with the criteria for a capital program the priority because the new phone bill service center library has been test nated to replace the shuttle the shock pen service center which was affected by the februari 2011 earthquake however you will revealed a time frame in the family amenity allocation this facility would delay for three years because of long-term play in meter 2070 consultation document for the tractor the 2016-17 llamo en el primer be in a 2019 timeframe for two documents is different this is a second issue because consultation document will be open in a 2019 however didn 't mention which month you know the key protein the changes will be open in g2020 so we review this to document is a tape will be between the six months to 17 months so print staff the business case for both the a new service center library as well as salt waist ratio center where we prepare by the april which meets next the next month this year solar consultation parking on page 11 says construction will start in the second half the 2017 so I 'm very disappointed about this country why should expect a soul in our culture should be able to deliver post this party in a more timely way so I show you mayor in the cancerous now for the next year 's annual plan I will expect most part yet we 'll be playing in the start in the ER leader of 2070 which means I suppose is early delivery of quality community facility secondly is unconcerned it 's a fee in a charges for auto a swimming pool because the proposed AVI and HRT for next summer last season four although the child will be increased from current the two dollars to two and a half of dollars let 's increase for 25 percentage and the 8 o 's were increased from current two dollars to three and so these the increase not only me you know pop I think a majority a community of fellow fed the family poverty can afford to pay this high interest so there I believe the success of the total poor coupled with the the mental strain on people in a moment that this will be afraid a signal to encourage more to be active healthy and have fun you creation our outdoor facility and also as you are well after the earthquake lots of lessons most of our families move to the southwest area from the east and the same model area we curling it thoroughly only have the Autoport so we have known and a credit center so this the utility is so you know quite high for that community for the community for the parent families c2 c3 the other items regarding to a capital release I 'm pleased better in a say in a long-term plan the capital 3ds has been reduced by 150 million dollars from the original 750 million dollars to six hundred million dollars however in terms of council financial position has changed significantly and insurance claim and received 635 million dollars so I insist on they are not supported a sailor sales the first I 'm happy later this annual plan to keep and reduce the rates the increase to our five percentage for another three years unhappy late so overall I support the earliest possible delivery of the complex of the Southwest facility in some other area community facility 2nd armored petty concerned auto fee increase the 22 hi silver are in season are supported and sss and unhappy the rich and reduced five percentage this year in the photo legs that two years so we wait and see the public amenity protect and we might have further review and make the final version of this issue thank you _"

    "text": "Pauline and then term thank you the end up most of its being said I think by now and so I 'll try to help Jimmy out by undertaking 30 seconds I just once again like to congratulate the consultation document because it 's in plain English it 's really good for people to read that and understand the situation of counsel here and we the money 's going where it comes from what it 's prioritized for but also contains enough financial detail for people to really get into it if they want to so I really hope this will encourage the Christchurch residents to make a submission and to feel confident that the time they invest in coming in here and talking to us will be recognized as it was last year it was a good process last year and we all really enjoyed people coming in and and I think we proved last year that we really did listen so I 'm pleased to see community community facilities are highlighted along with water quality and they 're both close to my heart so you see spirits are emerging and new homes being built and this will of course increases out our rating base which will continue to improve our books over time and of course we need to prioritize the earthquake repairs so that we can actually get past at all start to see some improvements and our local communities and our footpaths and streets that sort of stuff that 's really day-to-day fix people get past it so we can continue to move on so thanks again everyone for all the input on this and just to reiterate council Livingston 's words the collegial way in which we have all worked through to this point and I think that it 's really important to stress that this has been a rib yeah thank you and jump I think y 'all should get brave and go first because everything 's really been sued but I 'm I just want to say two and a half years ago pretty much a new council was elected and we walked in the door and shortly after that a statutory manager was brought in for building consents to take control of have to go on long way I think LeAnn pointed out that Lars in the last year there 's a hump and it seemed we got over it and I think with the insurance parts and I could go on about the bit of dividends being paid and hopefully that trend will keep going but not only have this city been through huge change but our staff has as well we 've got a new CEO they 've had a number of structural changes and I just want to thank them for the work that they have done on this document along with us because we are the counts orders councillors and our staff work together and it has been a huge amount of work done on this document I 'm really proud to be able to support this I think is a literacy before I really am looking forward to the engagement with their public on this document that B is you put it out pull in I really like the consultation document it is clear at a simple but it also outlines the implications of the changes that um thank you all very much for a great job done and Phil and then Jamie look I think a key point in the success of us is the work that 's been done as has been said by staff it 's particularly around the capital program in fact how how much that can be reduced in terms of what we as a council can actually deliver so I think we 're all really pleased to see that as a key part of the equation all right I want to comment but on some parts of the consultation document I think it 's a really good document the sectional cycleways just to be clear I think we actually knew that in fact to deliver these would take seven years so most people that won 't be a surprise the consultation processes that the whole process of having to acquire land and often building new curbs and channels all that takes time and so it and the key thing is Vicki back referred to is that the cycleways that need to be safe and and that 's what we will deliver around the northern arterial in cranford street there 's no question that in fact yes there 's more money had to go in the budget part of that was due to the downstream effects which now have been included and which we as a council were really clear on so although and I think it was good that the community board and the local business association brought those concerns to it to our attention we 're going to get a bit of transport as a result and the only other thing in or refer to it later is around the amendment for the car parking fees on heading part I 'll certainly be discussing it later too and Jamie thanks but will you be on the twenty-fourth of March 20-26 it 's pretty hard you know no one really truly knows what you 're going to be doing in 10 years time and we 're put in awkward positions I suppose where we have to do a long-term plan it 's a legal document and it 's a 10-year plan that 's what we need to say we will be a bit of information there to make an educated guess but it 's all it really is and it 's trying to take the Esper ations and the dreams and the hopes of the community couple that with the financial realities and try and put a flight path together the reality of the annual plan is it 's the deviations it 's the amendments to that to that long turtle team because it 's things get closer we have better information priorities change circumstances change effects become clearer so I think that I 'm finding that balance with the information that you have is never an easy and easy task but it 's been said how well I think we 've worked together as an elected a elected body of colleagues with our staff and with our community try and put our best foot forward we 've made some pretty shrewd decisions try to make some hard calls around the need to have versus the nice to haves no one takes pleasure in doing that because you know everything is important we want everything now and ideally it doesn 't I think I think what we 've got in front of us the draft annual plan is something that 's pretty upfront I think we 've been pretty upfront with that community around the capital release program I think we 've been pretty upfront with our community around the capital program and finally the only point I want to make is that I I think we now need the community to be pretty up front with us tell us if we 've got it right we don 't get everything right we try to but we 're putting useless if we don 't have the help from our community and ultimately we are there to be a conduit for them to help our community get the christchurch that they deserve the christchurch for christchurch by christchurch and that 's why it 's called a draft annual plan so we 're going in there with good faith there 's been a lot of hard work but there 's still a lot to go and it has been said but it 's important to note that the work from our staff around that 's appreciated I 've really enjoyed working with my colleagues around this so look forward to going through the process and hearing back from the community because that 's the exciting part David ten years time might get whether i 'll probably be still around the table but i am that 's certainly very supportive of adopting this annual plan and moving the city forden and I probably adopt the attitude that what I 'm contributing to us is probably going to be for the benefit of my grandchildren not rather than myself so look I really do endorse a lot of the sentiments that have been expressed already today and particularly the cooperative manner in which this plan has evolved I particularly give support to probably the four cornerstones over their annual plan changes this year the reduction to the capital program lower borrowing delaying and further capital release and allow increase in rates so look on the pleased that we 're putting this plan out for consultation there and I would like to see some good public direction particularly on items like prioritizing of road repairs live probably need to adopt a different attitude and some of our levels of service recognizing different treatment that 's needed in different parts of the city and that 's something that I certainly would endorse I 'm interested particularly in public comment on the glyphosate term issue that 's going to cost this city 20 million dollars plus over the next 10 years so and finally just with the cable review program there has been a lot of injuring and throwing with the eastern sport facility and I do note that in their draft they 're still a couple years of age 27 still refers to Eastern sports starting on there 's a diagram there in 2017 and on page 39 this reference to up exchanges with regard to the capital review program relating to the aquatic facility so there 's still a little bit of tidy up to do they so generally they like to reiterate my support for the plan and thanks to all those that are my colleagues and stuff for the hand which retails together this year I don 't have much to add I think insurance settlement obviously being a big piece of work which was completed the capital program review the operational savings and I think just you know we 've created a sound and stable financial platform for the next five years which is all about regeneration and I think that 's really where our focus needs to be and I think this is a good draft annual plan and I 'm looking forward to hearing back from the community on as Dave said where their priorities are whether were they 'd like us to focus and the trade-offs between lower rates and spending now and levels of service so I think it 's a good conversation and feels a little bit like we 're drawing a line under the last five years and we can start to look forward with more optimism thanks very much and thank you very much for the the quality of the debate because it just really does reflect I think quite a a significant well I was going to say change but then it makes it sound like it 's a negative but it 's not as extent of the issues that we had to confront as a city and I think that 's great and I think that Jamie was quite right the only reason that we 've got an amendment or the only reason we 've got a consultation document this time is because we 're amending the LTP and the only reason that we 're amending the LTP is because there are significant changes to the capital program this has a flow-on effect both positive and negative and that 's something that we want to talk to our communities about yani took exactly the words out of my mouth because I 've written down what I wanted to say which was to quote page ten priorities for our capital program these are the these are the basis for the priorities that we 'd sit now we want to hear from the community have we got those priorities right you know we 've said repairing or rebuilding facilities in the communities most affected by the earthquakes we 've talked about reducing flood risk we 've talked about we are feeling our commitment to the eastern even across the city ensuring that communities have good a social infrastructure prioritizing the repair of our streets pavements and Cuban because it was news to me that scoot didn 't cover pavements and that really was a bit of an eye-opener to me because it did explain to me why we had streets that just didn 't have even one foot part that people could use you know when they were trying to reduce their way down to the local supermarket or shops and and so I think that you know in terms of the footpaths getting you know seeing a perfectly well looking good to me footpath being dug up on my way to the airport and then knowing the extent of the damage still in the eastern suburbs you and end out at sumner on places like that you sort of think to yourself no actually we 've got to get those priorities right and I really take on board what Allie said about the need to to ensure that routine maintenance doesn 't get so far behind that it doesn 't provide for the immunity of and that 's what we 're asking our community to feedback on in terms of the priorities my view around maintenance routine maintenance we 'll renewals as they 're called is that they can 't be in a BAU framework of business as usual framework they need to stack up they 'll go stack up against the other damage that we 're repairing within our city and then of course the other areas of the prioritizing spending on water quality and suburban regeneration that 's very much a passion I think for everyone around the table was wanting to see that focus the other area of the consultation document that I 'd like to draw people 's attention to other coming years issues and challenges on page 13 and basically what this is is here as a council we want to find new ways of doing things we want to explore different options for combining facilities or using standardized designs opening our capital program to innovative delivery options for example you know sort of sending more work to the external markets skirt and development Christchurch what are the different ways process improving consultation making greater you severely contractor involvement and using more design and build contracts and Alliance models and I think we 're we 're in win it as possible to go faster that 's what we want to do but when we open it up to questions to our community do you have suggestions about how we could deliver our capital program and a more timely and efficient manner I don 't want anyone to think that that 's just directed at the residence it 's also directed at the contract and community the development communities and saying to them come we 're open our door is open to new ways of delivery new ways of thinking about how these projects could be better delivered because if we can if we can find the right trade-offs than those trade-offs that certainly I think everyone around this table would be certainly interested in and hearing about I know that some councillors have have gone back to raise the question of the anchor projects but I have to say that that we were signed up to them when we arrived get the best out of them for the benefit of the city as a whole and actually when you look at some of the ambitions around those anchor projects for the region as well because they will have a significant impact on our economy and here 's a flow-on effect two other parts I mean I 've made comments about the importance of the Convention Center which is outside our sphere of influence but that precinct in its own right will catalyze the announcements around other hotel developments it will enable us to one conventions and conferences that have been lost to us over the last week while so it is an important project and it might look like it has no social outcome but I guess that the benefit to the region as a whole is one of those that we would take into account I don 't think I think it 's important that we that we don 't misrepresent our ability to change things we can 't change we actually have to accept what is I 've had to suck up the odd but myself and accept in terms of capital release we never we never referred to asset sales as the only mechanism by which capital could be released to the council from CCA HL but although we can rely on from a religious point of view is the value of the shares the value of those assets and I 'm absolutely I was always confident that we would get to the position that we 've got to now but I 'm worried that there 's still a fundamental misunderstanding of what would have happened if we hadn 't signed off an LTP last year because without reference to the value of those assets and our LTP we wouldn 't have got the sign off from order and I don 't know whether people fully appreciate the seriousness of that situation have we had to confront it so I 'm I 'm glad that it 's been raised because it 's given me an opportunity to explain again that it is only the value and the assets that we can rely on it 's like we couldn 't rely on an exact amount for the insurance could be we could only rely on what the Audit Office accepted was was a reliable piece of information which was an assessment and fortunately for us it was well under what we actually received by way of our insurance recoveries so and I wanted to close on the same point that ref made was that we 're shifting to a new phase as a city a brand new phase we 're going from recovery for regeneration and to me regeneration means two things that means restoration and it means new growth so it encompasses both of those concepts and what an exciting future that puts in front of us for the next five years it is a stick change for the city and we need to make it there so the senior plan gives us the basis for for doing just that and I 'm certainly looking forward to the feedback from the community so that we can proceed from here and I 'm now going to find out how we perceive from here right so so we 're going to take a break now so yeah so morning 've got some hard copies of the amendments and notes available to everyone so if you can all have a look at those and maybe maybe do we want to take it to a half past ten yeah so Brooke will return it will adjourn till half past ten _"

morning about process I do want to make sure that we get the process process right so what 's the next item after the annual plan number six if executives report 91 I 'll take this food I just want to let those counters know that I hadn 't spoken to that the City Council put on a team into the sorghum management challenge so it 's a developmental challenge where people from across the organisation come together into a whole range of things given class including debate and reproach process improvement project range of other issues out of 16 teams across New Zealand classic is now one of the three finalists so the fight the winner will be announced at the gala dinner on the fourteenth of April when the winner goes to the australasian management challenge so it 's a great thing for pleasure to be recognized it 's your feet really managing from challenging issues and recognition of the work that staff put on in terms of and the progress that is made of time so we 're absolutely delighted battles good luck very other question time for the chief executive Yanni you think you I 'm just under operational results page 27 you make reference to hire NZTA operational subsidies I just wanted if we 'd had any update on the subsidies related to the accessible transport stages two and three men 's it 's here we haven 't had any specific response online you we apply for any um I think we 're still on it discussion there has been no confirmation so we 've got produce I victorious straight mature in the current financial year and I was just wondering whether debt increase was related to those projects and stage two that we 'd committed to but as it possibly get some information back around what the ended ta subsidies we can do that if cool thank you oh cool just a couple of things sound these snaps in solve I got exactly I did areas that were of concern and I had one of the contractors come back to me and asked me exactly where the problem was so I said well there 's a GPS coordinate but there comes with the snake chain solve but apparently that 's not getting passed on to the contractor so it 's not all contractors so there are some areas we have their technology is a bit older and so we 're working through that but there are some contractors where it does go through too so it 's about it there 's been a assistance systems across the second thing was just an emerging problem I think we 've raised before but it is going to become sort of quite critical coming up with it 's the building control group do an engineering prices which is being working exceptionally well and a thoughts come around maybe you start to finish type approach which looks at not just the getting the building and other things that are left around that service but actually looking side the building going what else needs to be done this take public some of the year bills between quite heavily damaged by the earthquake rxe sort of coordinated with those projects so start to furniture face would she assists I think in the long run and we saw you know down here with freeware neck hunts building got finished and the paving had me sword as we ended up putting down bitumen just to stop get the process but it you 've been on to it we would have actually got the paving down as it should so I 'm just thinking maybe we need to look at that going forward yeah I agree so there is some work in terms of how do we align some of their work across you know not just three goals but the other areas of work that we 're doing as well there 's also i guess this year about prioritization and how we can put that into the process but certainly we want to be able to complete areas as much as possible rather than sort of the coming back and picking up yeah the single that 's pretty part of the concern for million dollar development and outside you have you know some of the not pavers are well you know the other day when they finish the city wall for example say they are nice but now your paper is missing and they were bitumen full of mipzor it doesn 't look that great no I know and we 're now structured in a way that we can do that more easily so that we have that communication what were previously fun being a boat 's try lives thank you only one question on page that 's what you want the party of those were stated as recreation park based on the consultation document the victor will become Earp aware that decision on 19 of April know this public but right now here is a 70 ma so weathers before the public or committee are away or not of a decision big night I 'm not sure about that but but there is puppy the consultation balcony was on the National April so you come their information will be fit into the board decision on 17th of my ok yeah thank you page 26 in the first line coming again on 27 will you talk about operating expenditure trekking below budget and then you say capital expenditure remains at risk do you mean at risk of being under speak or yes again so as we 've been forecasting all the way on that 's fun just um Andrew thank you on page 28 there 's the right hand side of the page that we first lived from library project I just like to take the opportunity to record the community 's thanks impact to library staff who did a fantastic job in this space working with community members in the community board in that working group it 's a really good example in fact an exemplar of the way the council and community can work together to deliver a really good outcome that otherwise wouldn 't have occurred so in as much as it 's in your report I just wanted to take the opportunity to record it the community 's thanks to the staff for the work that they did in that space and equally um certainly library staffer talk to of the community but also the volunteers who it can help it was a really good collaborative process between staff community board and community the little to time bank played a role in the actual physical and moving of the stock yet certainly was a pleasure to be involved with and I look forward to seeing more similar collaborations happen in future thank you very smart move to use the two particulars reporter David three three quick points 1 just reinforcing pools comment about snaps in solve just the GPS number of people I can 't wander secondly just on our levels of service performance tracking it eighty-six percent heads and it 's an area of some concern in these and suburbs have we been realistic in our setting of targets or we are we trying to achieve more than we 're capable of so we have a large numbers a number of levels of service and the executive team are looking at how do we hone those down the things that really matter in the next financial year so there 's a quite a lot of work around that are we required and to comply what Soviet if you like essential core targets so for instance it may be around non contamination of water or e coli and if you need to be a hundred percent as the target did you so if you have one outbreak then you failed target entirely so there are a whole range of issues around the targets which we 're looking at what 's what 's the what are the things that we should be measuring one of the things that we required to comply with and are imposed on us and what are the things that we would want to know to make good decisions yeah I think pets we could add another factor into the equation we seem to have in some instances a one fits all model of level of service that doesn 't take into account differing conditions environmental bits and pieces and we 're trying to adapt one model across the whole city and I think we need to be looking more cite cite specific in some areas and that 's that 's an issue that people in lastly just on the health and safety age 35 Gracie Julia and I wonder I just like to see a little bit more elaboration maybe it 's something that could come to regulations and consents or another committee but we have you know quite a number of near-misses first aids and and we 've had a couple of notified problems and I 'm just keen to see whether there are any particular sections of council that are at risk more so than others and any trends that may be evolving across the broad spectrum of activities that we engage in so maybe we either expand this a little bit or there 's a more expansive report comes to one of the committee 's and I 'm happy to receive it at yeah this isn 't evolving Irian tunes are reporting for us so we 're trying to get the foundations right and as you know we had an order that actually looked at our readiness for the new legislation so we don 't hold a work and place to make sure that everything 's in place but that other areas month we 've got two established committees throughout the organization and we actually want to see things like near muscles reported more so as one of our plan on a page objectives a key one is looking after our cell and looking after each other and the expectation is that things like that will call out risks and issues and incidents so that we can start to address sighs and crawls under the new legislation we 're also interested in looking at our contractors and anybody that comes on any of our sites to making sure that we reduce the nearest and there as well so you 'll see increased reporting there is we need to report to the whole council in some way so whether there 's a part of a report in my report and end into one of the committee 's in more detail that 's a discussion I think we need to hear greater great what 's all I 'd like to move that the report be received Jimmy chin second identity nuh I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye they say no that 's carried some good timing now _"

seconded by tongue is there any discussion I 've got a better further amendment to the conditional point tonight well don 't like an alien yeah I think that we 'll see if we can get your amendment as the resolution well it could be incorporated as to be so a or not to be that there 's no question of this that their tongue and I 've given secretaries that the wording but it 's that will request Ikki and so when one a canary district councils to also include cdhb representative in a non-voting observer role and I understand that sample the people in the other territory authorities and Andy can are okay with happy to speak to a further if counts as wish but i think it 's been discussed yeah right and the ailment and that fits very neatly with the UDS I see approach now to be good all right now um are we going straight to UM debate all right I was just a proposed additional amendment as well Oh what was yours just um just when I reflect on the public transport I know that a group of young people actually held and opened out the bus interchange and they 've been very proactive in the space I think he can have been working with them as well so given that we 've got a Youth Council I just wondered whether we could make the request that actually they have you know extender and non-voting heavy pin to be voting but you know not wanting it to be lost actually let me see a baker 's also they represent it I just think when you think about the decisions we 're making around you know public passenger transport and the impact on young people I just think it would council rep with you I 've got no problem with it concept what I do have a problem with is that there are really a good number of interested parties in our city and who do all of it make a lot of input into public transport and like one group would be there is a hole transport advisory group who work with with a keen and meet regularly and also that the disability groups that they do too so I 'm just wanted to make sure we 're inclusive and not to leave young people out by all means I think we should involve them but that just wondering if that might be another step that fit in fact this committee might make but I 'll be interested to see what staff like rayon and Richard think of it and one of the things we 're working through the moment is the terms of reference of the proposed and PT committee goes ahead and what that seeks to do is establish will reestablish what 's known as a P tag group which is the public transport advisory group and council to be involved so the way the structure will provisionally work is that that group will advise up and report to the PT committee if it gets established so that will be that kind of technical experts as well as they could potentially set on that or important to that as a mechanism for why having a voice within the public transport realm I think I think the point about the youth council is it 's more than just his participation same way that we have you know apprentices and internships it 's actually we have a young person being involved at the local governance decision-making level so that they get that experience and understanding and you know I 'm slightly biased because you know i was on the youth council when we sat on the Community Housing and Economic Development Committee or the community service committee at the time and I can 't see any reason why we shouldn 't be trying to encourage anyone with just signed an MoU with the youth council and we talked about one in young people involved in active inner city that of those advisory groups because it 's a completely different experience but we can I mean if you want to address it another time make a secret request hey I don 't disagree with you at all I actually think that 's a very good idea to you know particular to say mentor young people into these governance roles that it 's really important is it better to do it in to me complete as opposed to this to me yeah we should start with their own commercial shouldn 't we well it 's stevan is some Richard see that 's establishing the terms of reference which is a really important part and maybe certainly we could make a note that we would particularly like yet there is canceled to be included and make a denser note for us and it would certainly be raised at the committee just and like I would assume it will be on the same basis as the dhp and NZTA they yeah Kristen to be on that committee from peers at the entropy no interest of that a tooth Council he only want to include representatives of the youth council a favorite person at all for the representatives of the youth council nominated formally on the committee and a non-voting capacity yeah yeah and didn 't and then it can be raised yeah but it 's it 's not sort of yeah it 's not sort of like that would you just repeat a non-voting observer role okay it 's just because if you got it because they 're not formally the air feels right for just that over the committee today yeah that 's quite important to it actually yeah otherwise they 're just a bit of a 13 an oxymoron to be an on button committee I mean it 's a hot is I look T you know I don 't think just saying it 's an observers really the right kind of word actually what we want is them to be part feel part of that committee and be actively involved in the discussions so no but that 's how they work it 's right this is how the whole thing is going to work it 's going to work in motion is still that we agree in principle and there are other important bodies and the youth counselor one who would be there an observer status the whole thing is about as partly about representation but in fact it 's about making sure that we set up the joint committee alright so that 's demeaning let me just take out those weird note it 's wish to include rape was into the youth council and a non-voting up see the role so you don 't need formally on the committee yeah Oh yep all right so we 've got them all move it you 've got to move it in us and I term sticky notes so i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye all right as a

    "text": "so submission on resort amendment bill three gene what is an updated version on your desk the substantive changes check changed so it 's easy to identify that 's correct madam chair sitting with me by the way is Polly leeming and Andrew Chris toxins of posting involved the version of the draft the one that was distributed yesterday has tracked changes showing the only substantive changes of correcting some typos and that sort of thing I would however also like to suggest at paragraph 10.5 ok I would also like to suggest that paragraph 10 5 1 further change in point five yeah so 10.5 is referring to an assessment of how many appeals were lodged over the last 10 years and what issues were raised in those appeals yeah the workplace stuff on that isn 't quite complete yet so I would recommend that their paragraph fever deleted from the draft submission and if he dealt with evidentially when presenting the solution at the Select Committee ok yeah that 's fine now there is one other related matter which I 'd like to bring to the council 's on a draft submission by the Canterbury mayoral forum that 's a two page draft submission that 's been proposed as if you like a placeholder and whilst for the work is done by the Cadbury mirror for on a more substantive submission so that there 's there 's no conflict between that draft placeholder submission and the City Council special they are consistent they live people before submission brother came very narrow forum I think we 'll come back to the council or to the mere sometime between now and the 24th March yeah we haven 't_''_148.95 I 'm just trying to think when the next meal four months ago yeah I just take one now they must be doing it by round robin yes yeah so yeah but I 'll circulate that as soon as it 's available yep yeah yeah thank you um yeah that 's good i think it would be really good for us to see the mill for submission obviously with the e can issue you know some of us probably as a counselor at a different position than what that collective token would aware of making sure that it 's not been consistent hmm so that 's that 's good it 's only a two pager but we can we can speculate that to everyone if it 's right there because I 'm get under 19.3 I think would be really good if you could just elaborate that for the counselors this was raised at the informal and counselors weren 't weren 't keen on this and you 've added quite a significant change and you know personally I think it 's a very good change another something I tried to raise at that informal so I 'm very happy to see it included but I think it is worth just for the knowledge of councillors given the discussion that the informal that you just kind of elaborate a little bit about why you 've put this change in sure it was as a result of fear the work that staff did following the question being raised at the last workshop and the question raised that the last workshop was as a absolutely correct to say that his duplication between the provision of for word development contributions under the local government act 2002 the case or removing the provision for financial contributions from the Resource Management Act is that it 's just in duplication with the development contributions under the LGA the draft submission accepted that it was a duplication but the further work that we 've done on this and what what you see reported at or included in the submission of paragraph 19.3 points out that it isn 't an exact duplication the ability to take financial contributions on resource consent application this goes a little bit further than the ability to take development contributions under the local government act a handy for slightly different purposes on top of that the the ability to take development contributions has some fear the limits under the local government act and boast limits for example one highlighted beer at bullet point for is that the crown is a bound by the part of the local government act that enables taking development contributions another one is that the ability to take development contributions for reserves is limited to residential development so you can take development whereas under the resource management act of your head provision as in your district plan that enabled it you can take financial contributions for reserves on commercial development if you had those provisions in your district and now they have been the debaters as other submission as a conceptual one if you like rather than one that addresses an actual problem faced by this council at the moment and in my view because the changes that have been made to the ability to take financial contributions under the replacement district plan very much limit the circumstances of much the council can take those financial contributions anyway so it would require some sort of change to the district plan team to take advantage of this provision called financial contributions that goes further than live in DC so perhaps we could have a briefing on that I wasn 't aware that throw district when we were significantly reducing that capacity and also just under 90 19.2 I don 't know if that 's supposed to be struck out on page 18 it says accordingly the council does not opposed to repeal financial 've got in 19.3 19.4 so what 's his omnipotence is either retain the ability to take financial contributions or I mean I told you before as possible relax so that 's er the council made a submission on the DC policy when the government made the changes and that was unsuccessful and as a result we 've ended up costing us tens of millions of dollars on things that could have been charged with the dc 's that that now aren 't so probably the relief that enabling us to actually be able to take financial contributions there 's probably the preference that I would certainly like to put forward and you know I don 't see why we should support but I don 't see why we should not not not opposed to repeal the financial contribution but I just it just seems like it limits us and for no good reason and it is very different to the dcs and and that counts for us what 19.9 table for says no no I agree but if you read 19.2 it says the council does not oppose the basis hidden meaning they don 't oppose it on that basis and then you Duane Reade 19.3 and in a suggestion solution I thought it was neat you know is a neat not neat Toyota may vary so if we 're opposed that repeal on the financial contribution provisions on the basis that that would make sense but to say that we do not oppose the repeal of is like two negatives and end up sort of saying that we support the repeal of the financial provisions so it just doesn 't it doesn 't make sense at all right i think the ascertain we have to make is do we support removing the ability for council to seek financial contributions we 've seen either retain the ability to take financial contributions or amend the LGA so that the trigger for taking development contributions as development occurring not growth rather than the definition of development and provide that the crown is bound by the sub part 5 of part 8 of the LGA that 's the solution there 's what we 're proposing you 're either have financial contributions or mean you can you can expose that if you want why does Apple it was very tidy thank you me and it could explain something that I didn 't understand particularly well that 's what it was very helpful experienced and I hadn 't realized what a significant rust the solarium compensation payments were until I read cash as well so the our submission that you have prepared for us has been very helpful so to speak the drafters of that submission are sitting over by the wilderness Oh mr. O 'Connor a mr. Smith very good well much appreciated all right so and now who do we want to go to speak um on the submission well I think that you would I do it will try and get it so if they 're down here then we 'll encourage the Select Committee to come to Christ change but if not then we can do it by you know phone or video so are there any any do anyone who 's particularly okay i 'm happy that you did you love it yeah learning learning as you go along some connections also with the greater part changes that are coming as well so i think it would be quite good to do that and all right okay nominate stallion um right so um well I shouldn 't move it since I 'm being nominated I 'll move it yes the key a Nicole be discussion I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye opposed say no it scary thank you _"

it so it may not have gone through okay that that they might actually have the answer to the question who wants to move this one because it 's been through two committees Oh Phil seeking the rare maybe we have we had some clarification the terms of reference or the committee 's there 's somebody come up with some weirding between two committees yeah yeah you know have yes that the two committees we want to stop that from happening yes yes I couldn 't agree more haha actually we got to go somebody 's done the bleeding it 's just it 's quite difficult because most policy changes and go to the strategy committee but because this was heavily involved in in pedestrian crossings and road infrastructure and we felt the ite committee needed have a look at it as well so and we will advise by governance to do both then the terms of reference that was what quarter that so so at he had to send it through strategy and finance yeah it could have easily come from the infrastructure committee to the council yeah and I think what we want to achieve is that it 's one or the other yeah one or the other yeah but somebody was sorry I raised this with some someone come on but last week and they said they 're going to try and get some weeding and i 'm sure i got an email to say that waiting was also a meeting i haven 't seen that though in terms of it 's the strategy committee in terms of policy changes who has seen who currently has some that 's basically what we want to achieve is that policy changes go through one committee oh man how about how about we approve so instead of request clarification on the terms of reference the Queen so instead of that one right a different ones saying that the committee that it will that such papers will be we 're there are two committees where and above the policy interests of strategy and finance you 've been by agreement between the chairs the paper will go to one committee it sounds good yeah so we 'll just we 'll just approve the the principal and the wording of the change can can be sorted we raise this issue in relation to regulations and consents as well regulations and consents review the bylaws that don 't make the bylaws policies and they go to strategy and Finance which actually may not be the right committee for them that they might be a cheer door as he or actually by default it should be rigs and consent because they 're the ones who do the overarching review it 's more of a detailed you know sort of analysis analysis of a process and hearings that more of kin two rigs and consents than strategy and Finance regime finances the overarching strategic approach so so maybe even know maybe we need to change it we 're there we 're a very we 're by agreement between the strategy and finance committee chair and and the relevant committee a and Finance gets out mean that 's what we 're trying to say and then that means that they can that the chair of strategy and clients could agree with David on a mentor or you could agree with Phil or Andrew yeah and i think that 's that 's the policy so if we can write that into the and to the terms of reference of all of the committee 's then that solves the problem it sounds good we are by agreement between the chair of strategy and finance so just do the prevalence other words and ames the chair of another committee that the matter be referred through that other committee yeah so yeah I haven 't got a wedding right but you know what I mean but yeah there may be a process issue around this as well because of course Phil as the chair of it II and I as the chair of chaired aren 't aware of what the workflow coming through strategy and finance is so ref may discuss a paper with staff in relation to the agenda-setting meeting for strategy and Finance on the strategy and finance agenda until such time as it appears there so very often it could be that there 's a paper that ends up at strategy and Finance which may more appropriately have gone to chaired or eating and the point at which that would be picked up would be the agenda-setting meeting that of course refs passing but that fill in irons in respect of strategy and finance so we can we can do that on Zoey 's we can do that at strategic over so that they have committed a place I think to resolve those as a preliminary meeting with the board cheers and principal advisors those informal meetings yeah in hopefully things that will need to be when we hear that we had exactly that discussion about an item drone policy which we require by the water date I mean it 's I don 't want to pass a drone biol or any more than anything else but I were required by law to pass one well why should it get a strategy in finance it 's not strategic it 's not financial to do it should go to David so I think the point I 'm making is a lot of this requires ref probably to identify things that are on his agenda setting agenda whether I might appropriately go anywhere yeah we meet that chair and deputy meets with the staff for agenda-setting meetings so we could do that I 'm having to pick up and is like a lesser amount of ice hey I 'm always happy to refer papers to other committee yeah yes but with this resolution emotions we could refer the drone one straight to David 's comedy right that 's good it 's a perfect i think two minutes here that the stuff could make you as elected members aware that this is coming up to say that should happen at SOS yeah hmm yeah yeah its strategic oversight subcommittee where all the chairs are present it can be staffs can alert us to any of these sorts of papers and yeah yeah because we don 't want to get into the situation where we 've got to two bits of advice and I mean you 'm particular disabilities this also comes on the terms of reference for Chad so I just wanted to check that this is this policy has been discussed with our disability Advisory Group who report to chad and so what their feedback was i know 'd has been discussed with the disability sector I 'm not sure counselor exactly how many but they are mentioned in here so that my recollection that 's fine it 's fine print now but it was that it was discussed as Richard saying it was discussed love with all of the disability advocate groups efficacy groups just think we 've got an advisory committee or groups it up especially for this it would be really good to have as part of a green to a policy a summary of their feedback given that that 's the whole purpose for existence with your feedback is in the report well I couldn 't find it Smith um well if it hasn 't been to an advisory committee that set up for the purpose so that 's gone through two committees and I 'm an unhappy that we 't been to the advisory group well I should report on it absolutely there 's a comment in the report from from debt okay I 'm sure though I the printer is very small in this yeah but I do record when that came to the atty committee that certainly had been to the different advocacy disability advocacy groups including the Foundation for the blind yeah I wanna do it I might have some fun oh ok you said um the disability Advisory Group that we have internally within Council so do we bring in community representatives from this so that 's fine if it 's been there that 's great it would just be good to get something back from them over their view of this yeah as part of this report and I mean that 's pretty hard to read as you pointed out some of the pages but I just think it goes across three committees of counsel no longer so and we 've also got an advisory group so you know what what ya knees raising is a good point and I 'm not sure that probably doesn 't say they right so we should we have a disability Advisory Group are they cool together do they meet regularly or only when papers are being made available what 's the president I 'm not sure we we specifically symbol information in work with the blind foundation in the disabled persons assembly of Christchurch so those were the days where key organizations have been over the document I don 't do it because I don 't know what the advisory group I mean how often how often that it meets and no can I just suggest we hope about five minutes and get Phillip they sure to because he reported on is that they actually committee we could beliefs in England also have a disability advisor who would probably be able to answer whether they 'd seen it or in it as well yeah good try if it maybe they haven 't so you know I mean look I 'll come back to it can you see if you can find out before the meeting ends which is not very far away and the next item is item _"

    "text": "so if we could now move to item 39 removal of batch port levy paper 39 and I think for the sake of moving these issues on I 'd like to move the the recommendation hinder yep that Jonnie thank you made reference to additional information can you do we get that advice back in can you just no no no no no no all I wanted to know was that the property owners had been advised that this item was on the agenda today and they have been advised that 's all I wanted to do it needed to be clarified thank you for clarifying yum and then I just had some questions of stuff but are they and we have had this paper before us and I 'd like to move to debate as quickly as possible okay well I mean we had the workshop and there were some requests made at the workshop but basically things like a site visit that 's just not going to happen so that the additional inquiries it 's buzzy this is this is a so I just wanted to clarify that we heard that we were being asked to take action unfortunately time didn 't allow for the question of the submitters but I 'm just trying to understand why doubt asking us to take action which was effectively a private property dispute so if they take an engine themselves which they are entitled to do under existing laws to resolve the situation and if not if this relates to a legal road mm-hmm no actually the deputation this morning was about yes I understand there but in terms of our our role as a council it relates to a legal road and I think the other thing was that nine-tenths of the batches or legal rule so so it is a requirement that we take action not so that the private landowner will need to take action as well but we are required to take action in terms of the 19th which is on legal road yes but there 's nothing that precludes the people that made the deputation this morning from actually taking that action so the kind of if they took that action I 'm just trying to do that but the bit work that 's underway or why weaving I mean I can understand the request for us to enforce or not to enforce but to do our out make a decision that 's quite different from what they can do as a right under existing walls I think I think both both parties will need to take action to remove the beach if that 's the intention okay and then just the final question from me as again this was one one issue that was raised at the workshop in terms of the structures on Street policy and the wider implications around how we respond to this request versus the other batches and other areas what would be the implications of doing this in isolation of those wider policy issues which you know when I understood from some of the comments and the deputation I could understand but but also if you look at the men that we were given as part of a workshop you see that some of the land sets some of the Mardi reserved led actually the Murray reserve development is actually interested in how we 're consistently taking an approach across all those other issues of our public name being used for the policy doesn 't cover the policy doesn 't specifically covered residential dwellings on public road did actually steers well clear of that and it really only deals with structures such as retaining rules garages that type of thing where there 's no other space on the hull was for those structures to be constructed so the policy is quite clear that what this is not you know the structures on streets policy is quite clear on that but this is we 're treating this as its own case so just when I look at the map on page 42 so um the idea that people that are using our public land for whatever end of these structural or recreation how we take are we satisfied that which they can consistent brooch if yes we are i mean what you 're raising is a much wider question across the whole of banks peninsula well no x i 'm just raising it with the skin of officio where the the as part of that properties being used for the reserve yes it 's on public land and i 'm just going to make sure that if there 's any risk around the consistency of that application of our of our actions through this process I don 't that 's a really can 't answer both have a team to answer across the city is there are there multiple examples of private occupation of legal road however most of those team to be fences Gardens bushes they don 't tend to be in there very few examples that I 'm aware of of residential occupation a residential structure occupying the nero those examples are few and far between there are some there are there aren 't a large number I would say the problem is the number of fingers on your hand there will be more than one so the policy in terms of structures on the streets is clear it applies to the whole city it doesn 't apply to residential structures because there are so few Richards right that the approach to tune in terms of residential structures is circumstances so if someone requested us to take action around a non-rigid infrastructure on public land we would we would do what in this case well we we have a policy which would apply to ism we would we would measure that against the policy and then make a recommendation I 'm kind of getting a little lost here but one of the issues i 'm just in terms of the the decision that we 're going to make i 'm just not sure whether there 's there the value to be added to the debate that we now have to have we think i can raise over the boat okay hello Jimmy okay my Oscar those Reed 's reads the issue because the in three pointer six star particular machine in two thousand in the tail when they start aware of the great space each oh so have a refund for five years but solution air and also hi Stan period placed and period three found for five years away with a legal requirement to reform the rates for five years yes they should never have been living for banks dimensional it became apparent and as a consequence we refunded the rates or for the five-year with legal period so five years is a back to LA to sylvania five to two thousand attack this time period always after two southern takes the major perfect to me thanks not sure and crash yesterday is that right no I went back just back five years yes but but 2010 we meet in 2007 yes yes so you eat one year a year one year here yeah so this is a this is a historic issue that we have inherited from the amalgamation of thanks none chiller so banks furniture district council wasn 't operating a crisis in our schools at any time during this period this Caribbean okay yeah so okay yeah that might have some pressure yeah so after the 2010 up to now so council didn 't check the rates no more you know that you can 't even write on it on the legal right okay thank you neither of a patient team thank you my question is over 5.1 in the report where it says there Runanga between 1942 live in cities so yeah is it our understanding that at you know over that period of time this issue that removal of the batch was never invite that better understanding the room on you may see their tongue must be differently but we understanding and speaking with the family was there was a mutual arrangement thank you alright i 'll i 'll open it up for debate all right yeah just very quickly i support the the table resolution i 'm just looking at this has been clear from 2005 but this is ben annie illegally occupied space and i 'm sitting here scratching my head thinking why 's it taking so long to sort this out and it seems we 've got a straightforward resolution now and I think we should be moved to deal with this as soon as possible yep yep hmm Danny yeah thank you um I think the structures on legal riders usually difficult issue partly based on the historic context that many of these structures find themselves in but also in terms of consistency across the council so we 've site visit that 's not going to happen and it just seems to me though that we need to make sure that we 're consistent in terms of our approach to these sites sorts of structures and so I feel uncomfortable about making a decision today and is to two meters to inconsistencies around this one is that in terms of the issue of public access the assessment we 've done around the Taylor 's mistake patches is completely different to this one so that 's why personnel I thought it would have been incredibly valuable to do a site visit to actually understand what the restriction to public access would have been and why this one is so different compared to Taylor 's mistake when entitles of state you 've got small tracks winding around existing batches that we 've them that don 't impede public access and here you 've got probably the width of a driveway that and and and you know quite some distance between the structure and a public road that enables you to the past that were being told impedes public access so my in isolation but we actually take the consistent approach I think the other interesting thing about this one is when we had the workshop and it was pointed out that we have part of the public road actually also being occupied by other private private residence or private purposes so just basically just a little bit outside of where this area is but in the same vicinity so I 'm kind of struggling to understand the consistency of our approach that we were told that there 's a lack of public space in this area and we need to extend the reserve and so we 're going to ask that the batch gets remove but we 're not doing anything else about the other land that 's been encroached on in the same area so you know I personally think we should resolve the wider issue we should actually look at our structures on streets policy around these structures and I would hate the risk of making a decision and isolation of just taking a consistent approach for for fear of the legal challenge I in no way minimize the property I acknowledge the good work at the local we are doing with the community as was raised in the deputation and with the development of the different schemes of important ways here but there 's nothing that stops them from taking that action as a private property and there 's no reason why why we should be i think in the middle of that other than sorting out that wider issue that we have so we can take a consistent approach so my preference isn 't_''_826.34 to make a decision on this today but is to come up with some consistent approaches through whether it 's a district plan review whether it 's a wider policy review and make sure that we can actually morally defend the decisions that we make then thank you my position is to make a decision today I I think when you look at the timeline you might reasonably conclude the has been active very patient when I attempt to see things through the batch on his eyes I can see that an agreement which looked quite you know onset is quite peaceable existed that they actually know should be there but i think is a bigger picture here which if i 'm right i 'm hearing today a much broader picture than just this batch and it is about land is about if you 've ever seen those confiscation maps over time I think that that 's what we have to consider as well and so I will support this resolution to do David for me there are there are two issues at stake here one of them is quite categoric the other is less I had had this been split into two parts I probably would have a degree of empathy with what we 're trying to achieve here there was no doubt that this patch encroaches on to Maryland and I have absolute support of the notion that the batch should be removed or that part of it should be removed for Maori land I agree with yanni quite extensively over the other issue of structures on public land or on paper roads legal roads and I agree totally with yanni that we need a consistent approach to dealing with with in a particular manner there are batches at car tuna and there are a number of other properties that will surface in the monster and years to come over banks financial or in other parts of the city so I would totally support the notion that that part of the batch that is on Maori land has to go and that becomes an issue for the current occupiers of that well there you have to cut the batch in half will pick the thing up and shift it flawed or whatever but they 've got to get off Mary land as to the the tenure on the paper road I particularly think that we are setting ourselves up for a lot of issues to come because there are as I said earlier there are a number of other similar situations that we 're going to have to deal with and to be dealing with them piecemeal is not the right way so I would support the removal of the batch from Maori land a hundred percent but I have severe doubts about the paper road side of things so I less someone I might sort of foreshadow a an amendment okay I got Jimmy Dean Jamie yeah I supposed the staff recommendation because while anticipate properties we are all aware is on the legal world or so based on the actor based on low it should be the remove second is when they start aware we had charged the kind of the reeds no no melissa is kinda like a rule in all public or property which isolates wonderful was unaware but when we aware we refund in for the five years in 2010 to thank you 2005 and after data council never charged the kind of rates I think that 's a very reasonable you know the council where is the situation the other one is to process these that time period for two years you know give the H popular owner 90 of the time to process that all to find out the new house this kind of I think also the reasonable the last how it is very crucial is a child remove let H property is not a purpose that purpose is because pyro pilot actually public benefit or community and the more people because whether they were put into the long-term plan we have a establish a public toilet and also on a picnic area in the upgrade a compact they spent the majority of people so so I supported a little recommendation I mean look I think the way to to remedy dives to the figure me Jimmy James James James Jimmy just got married on the weekend I 'm so bathing um but IIIi think from daves do you understand me saying I think that the way you 're emitting it really is is your something vote against the resolutions there because what 's written from one through before really doesn 't take into account the the former part of will issue that you raised and they quite clearly are one you 've got a batch that encroaches on Maori Reserve Land the second part of it which is the council decision relates to an assassin family batch which sits on legal road so where I sit with this I have really important for the local brewing and I know you 're here is on someone else 's land that 's pretty black and white in my book so I believe that it is David looted to that needs to go from the portion of land which is not this the other aspect of it which dave i think quite rightly said it is a little bit more gray helped by the likes of situations around Taylor 's mistake so our council decision really relates to that which is the existing family batch which sits on local Road in my view and I 've been at the workshop and I 've looked at this really closely i don 't believe that public access along the beach site is truly impede adhere i think there 's a reasonable department reasonable width for people to be able to get past the more I 've looked at this because it 's not black and white on the bottom the paper road issue rightly or wrongly you 've had a family that many generations of go did everything they could do to purchase a batch they purchased a batch that they believe that they they owned and rates for that one I agree that the area that encroaches on Mary reserved land needs to be remedied and that 's up to the batch owners to do that and that 's not really our business but needs to happen as soon as possible the other side I don 't believe that I can come in here as account so it doesnt sit easy with me to say that I believe that they need to get off this paper road from a range of issues namely so that it 's the the Kiwi dream that intergenerational II there has been a batch Thea that family family has enjoyed and they 've paid rates on it and they believe that to be theirs so I 'm going to vote against the recommendations because I 'm not going to be voting to kick these people off of this paper road they 've they believe it was theirs and they 've paid rates for a long time I acknowledge there 's a wider issue here and I also acknowledge that the local brew nya I think your arm have got some incredible superb caretakers and Guardians the land there but with with respect to the batch I 'm going to be voting against the recommendations because i think that uh i think the family of a right to be here thank you I just conclude the debate that by saying that when 's the this matter and this match has been before council for a while went to the community board they were very clear about their position it came through to council and at the end of the day we referred it to together through their advice and that 's this paper that 's come back today having read the paper and light of the additional information that 's included in the memorandum item go to the workshop but the report from the chief executive is for me crystal clear it makes it absolutely clear that you know that there are complete differences between the circumstances that Taylor 's mistaken ball tube a debt there is no neither has been illegal status in terms of ownership of the land it 's only been them their building itself and I do feel know major part of our world available to their family for such a long period of time but it 's not it 's not a right that we should turn unto it 's not a privilege that they should we should turn into a legal right I don 't believe we had to be ability to do that and nor do I think that is at the correct decision so I 'm happy to move the resolution and it 's been seconded so i will put the motion all those in favor say aye aye those opposed say no no and recalled yeah could we just have a record of those that voted no David piece Jamie golf and Yanni o handsome I declare the motion carries thank you I _"

is something that the as of top priority we look forward to your submission only no TP mmm thank you and and moving on to the next report which is on page 291 would you like me to comment now and I we 've done all the minutes oh okay I 'm just giving you a free head is there anything that you want hurt with and the page 293 we we we haven 't an informal agreement now with staff any public round trains are going to be removed I just I think that all community boards would appreciate being kept in the loop early on in the process just like with most links and 200 page 295 just note that the council after the the Energy Committee made a recommendation on the back and park swap in exchange we had some more discussions with community and unfortunately didn 't come to any consensus on the merits of the exchange and swap proceeding so end the date for the conformational agreement has lapsed and it 's a great i pi think that will look back at their and see there is a significant loss for a community and I feel really bad for the six society who will put actually put in that position by counsel but i think that was done with the best of intent and and I and I think that yeah it is a shame but I want to commend the sick society for the way that they 've conducted themselves throughout the process so can I just come in i think the lesson learn from park there 's every reason that what happens on those parks should be delegated to the community boards hmmm that 's all we do it but it wasn 't able to be resolved that the community partner with what we 're really really down time and and quite understandably the sick society chose not to pursue that any further and amid some very loud and strident opposition which we which we heard of committee so do you think that you would have been able to resolve it with clear the time I think worth further discussion at the initial community board level that we would have resolved it I think that clearly given the time that all talk as Paul is indicating the the applicants the Sikh society ran out of patience and effect and looking else we 'd rather Lee and they have a site where they have the right to build and they 're proceeding with their into detailed design so yeah they will be there and there will be a part of said them in the community board looks forward to the further involvement okay and then of Christina loughton who was a champion and in a pioneer and the transgender rights and Christchurch and an incredibly brave person and I 'm sure any of you who familiar with whom will have known that and appreciate his service to the community yep thank you and finally just what it communes rowley again paint on page 30 20 I wasn 't able to be at this meeting because my son had a was in hospital broken down but we had a bunch of young guys from rarely come and talk about worrying footlights and for a basketball hoop you 'll see their names in the agenda michael antonio Karen Shaquille Bailey party Bailey and Christian just rarely as an amazing community you go back 20 years and you look at the huge progress I 've made and you know they are leading the way now I enter price in terms of community development and lower socio-economic communities kept in the right direction yep good stuff thank you very much thank you game would you like to come and join us we 've actually already passed your minutes but end of free hat I 've described it so I 'd like to give you one too since the increasingly met but I don 't know what Andrew see it no so we just passed them it we just passed minutes and that was also that legal options here open to you oh right well um as you know the freedom camping issues have caused us quite a major issue so I just really wanted to thank the staff for their involvement in the process and we will wait what happens but it 's um it 's been a challenging time for us all we sincerely acknowledge the the community and the the aspects of that have affected them and impacted on their lives and things and as I said we will wait for word till until the next step we know a lot more now than what we did before all about freedom camping and about moving forward and how we might look at them what it might be resolved with the issues we need to look at including going down to the looking at the sites more closely water supplies are like have they got the streams not minimum flows if they 've got war from the blocks or whatever it might be though there are a whole lot more issues now that we need to address when we 're looking at freedom care and maybe it might be a whole different way of camping on banks the trip they might be all in holiday parks and camping grounds wouldn 't it be good and so the the other things that that we were excited about the reopening of the the Gaiety theatre on the first of April and the odd fellows hall and it 's on the celebration of odd fellows as well and they actually had a work around there this morning which andrea and i have missed they had a pre look this morning so but we do look forward to the opening and she looks magnificent the old lady standing on the corner beautifully colored and painted and we look forward to that occasion the other thing is that the season of the cruise ship seasons is coming to an end it 's always lot of those that are involved with the management of the tourist season felt the pressures once again this year and always looked at the end but I 'd yet we just need to thank all of those people that are involved with managing those that industry including Environment Canterbury and the Harbormaster and those that work with us as well to ensure that we have a well-managed season so I could talk for hours about things the positive things that are happening in our community and we do need to focus on those and the amazing support that we get from people what our communities are very important they know a lot about our community and as we 've learned through the freedom camping process they often know more than what we do and we need to work collaboratively and Leanne as you said yesterday the community is a very important part of being resourceful peps we wouldn 't we didn 't say resilient did we I didn 't say resilient but being resourceful and getting on with life and doing some of the things that council can 't my little say this morning well just one of the distant and feedback on one thing is that I 've been talking to a number of the other South Island Mears and it 's been interesting that their experience of freedom camping has been different in different parts of the country and they 've taken different approaches to so wheel clamping and queenstown has had an incredibly dramatic effect on breaches which have disappear largely so so different experiences as people have had the bylaws for the first time I think we need to share our experiences across particularly the South Island because we have you know a particular propensity for people to you know to fly under christchurch and then basically do the round trip spoke to the mayor of nelson i spoke to the mayor of Dunedin you know so in theory nuances and different approaches that have been taken so I think that trying to get some feedback and initiating a bit of a questionnaire around the South Island just to see what the feedback has been their experience what their by law was what did they the the community engagement as well so I 'm hoping that that will then enable us to put some clarity around where the problem really lies because I don 't think that it 's just in the bylaw I think that maybe and the overarching legislative framework that we operate under and it also may be in terms of the different approaches around contained and in non self contained no yeah not contain self-contained and non-self constrained yes so you know it 's been it 's been an interesting experience but our experience is not unique but our experience can be quite different from what other areas smaller town centres have approached things in a different way so you leave that process I what I want to do that around South I 'll Amir 's just as an employee approached and once I 've got that feedback I want to I want to feed back to all of them and then see whether we need to take it further but I it 's interesting sometimes people forget that when you start with the problem you should always start by defining of the bile or in place and these different parts of the particularly as I say the south island and not the reason I want to pet the South Islanders because every giveaway by law it has an effect a flow-on effect into the neighboring district council so not one you know it almost you know and I don 't want to go to a solution but it might be that a matching bile or across the South Island might be easier to communicate then individual bylaws that that don 't have a connection with each other so anywhere but as I say defining the problem means that we need to gather information about the experiences of the different districts and cities in the south island I can assure you we 'll all go a bit and asking whether it 's through local government Commission are not like local government New Zealand yeah members of parliament or whatever it is that we need do need to look at tourism and how it has managed in New Zealand it 'll only get more I am an ex holiday park operator in it 's all about but you know we do need to get something that will help us all throughout the country yeah and it 's not just to resolve our issue yeah I am no jaani I 'm not taking questions I 'm just I 'm just giving p.m. a free person then I took a one myself so eager and it 's the it 's the benefit of being the chair so thank you very much pain be much appreciated right so _"

    "text": "um as one we 've heard a lot from our community over there the areas on the port hills with mass movement and rock fall issues I really concerned that the pedestrian access has been compromised in some areas and while we recognize that there are real safety issues over mess movement I kind engineering solutions that need to be made it 's a real concern when we 're looking at increased pedestrian access on the hills with reek left school possibly closing and extra traffic as well that that generates and so we 're very keen for pedestrian access decent foot pads to be prioritized for pedestrians in this area and we 've had some information further information on both my bone point inquiry road and from staff since our resolution and but there 's also shared rock reserve that you might have seen in the Christchurch mail this morning the the large set of shipping containers that everyone 's these photos I 've down by some not have a 2.5 meter footpath underneath them and there 's a temporary one on the other side of the road at there 's currently no funding and that transport project to reinstate footpath for pedestrian access and I think that David nums and his some further information on that one um I think there was an issue around including the specific you know my bone point and quarry road and other areas certainly accepting because that our staff have got to do a lot of work on you know the life safety risk and all of those things so but certainly you know making pedestrian access a priority is something that we 've looked across Ward 's you know over in the East there are still streets that have not had a workable proper for you know sincere place and that is a lot of work to be done but certainly very keen to make sure that port hills don 't miss out on that regard either so our pool it 'll this just is quite a considerable matter for money going into the opening of the little Tennessee corridor yep and as this seems to make a lot of sense we have money on budget for summer cycleways there is into a reinstatement of some of these these pathways would be a really good idea yeah i think the cost efficiencies and doing it could save us potentially millions of dollars yeah so Oh Dave would you like to update and particularly around my point we 're certainly doing that we 're looking at the alternatives my understanding is we put a temporary foot pup on the outside of it the work that we 're going to be doing in the remediation of the mass movement is totally different to the work that we 're doing around the writing but we are looking at linking the funding that we 've got available to bring back a footpath the funding that 's available for the coastal pathway in the cycleway all into one sort of project however we are at that prelim design stage at this because till we work out exactly the mass movement we 've brought the houses all the rest of it how that one 's going to go that design still needs to be finished so we 're looking at integrating it and I am trying to put in is sort of falling into the sea a button so we are looking at whether we can accelerate some of that work to make at least a reasonable footpath however we don 't want to duplicate funding or expense basically in the one so we are looking at how we could accelerate maybe a final solution wonder if it would be good to do a presentation to the community board or even even a presentation out in the community you know with another certainly we 've been looking having a number of community meetings and a number of newsletters that are going out reasonably I suppose at this point I don 't have the details so it 's a bit early to come and talk meet up but certainly staff are working in that space so as soon as that 's available I think there 's been quite a good flow of information backwards and forwards I think at the stage and will certainly continue that I think you know that they would like to be involved and sort of it the earlier part of it so because out and talk to people then sometimes yeah yeah that a compostable you we appreciate you get my drift yeah yeah good Yanni yeah can I just clarify because I think that really goes to the heart of the problem which is that the local community board and the count doesn 't have decision-making over the design of this corridor that 's been done through the hague which prevents any opportunity for alternative design betterment so can you just clarify the decision-making process around these projects because we have had meetings and we have been told what 's happening that is quite different to us actually being the decision-maker where we can lay up the different things people say I imagine the final solution particularly around the mouth point we 're talking about at the moment is is really since probably along the lines of the coastal pathway because I don 't think we would actually build a pup footpath and then the coast parkway next door it would be an integrated decision-making process it would be involve the community and it 's a little bit like where we 've been taking that piece of work and incorporated in some of the work that skips doing so in actual fact that makes say they actually occupy that whole site and so we will then look once we 've done those separate bits of work bundling it to see whether we can get a better cost of delivery I think that the decision-making what on the footpaths and looks like will lie with with the council because the the actual corridor project itself while it is taking away a 2.5 meter footpath to do the rock for safety the petrol transport project itself doesn 't include any funding to replace that footpath somebody safely as can you come out of EIU funding because the skirt optimal basically the work that we 're doing around the rock fall and remediation them at last minute movement has got a very tight corridor and it doesn 't incorporate reinstatement of that so it 's actually coming back into that normal program but there is money in the budget of that normal BAU program to do that and certainly look footpaths are a priority so the levels of that road aren 't going to change that much nor as the alignment of that however obviously young there will be curbs and channels and there will be footpaths and things like that that we 've heard we 've period here today that there is money in the BAU Council budget for this part of the project and I think people forget that footpaths aren 't included in the nzta budget so that 's why it 's not an austerity program so yeah but anyway at some that was a very reassuring comment i 'm glad i asked you to make her the other the other thing on the edge in that area and behind those large shipping containers at the moment of three historic cans yeah in the community very concerned to make sure that they are removed safely and reinstated in an appropriate place and so that 's kickin services that you know funding Pradesh project as well happy my understanding is that they 're going to be removed as safely as possible i think the council already again we could advise from the heritage they can be lifted and they are going to lift them and take them to one of our sites because we don 't want them knocked over as we do earthworks or buttons or rock falls or whatever we 're going to be doing behind those containers and then we 'll come back to the community i 'm not sure because of resource conceding planning whether they can go back into the place where they were so we will need it maybe talk to the community about where they go in the long term but they are being we 're getting advice i 've been whether i don 't know exactly what they 've been done but they 've been dismantled in such a way that we can rebuild them as as they not but they may not be able to go back in the same and we 'll talk a community about that that could be a feature along the coastal walkway one very final last one on this the living are doing well yeah they are I don 't remember that when the council resolve the mess movement and areas around the port hills and the information was very technical a lot of people didn 't understand it fully but seeing the experts go through the process that they came to to decide on these mess meant areas and in was really reassuring for the public and it took a lot of the heat out of the situation and it would be really good to have a even why we don 't have all of the solutions to explain the technical information and a really full and proper way to that community most community along there and it 's really really important and will help them understand why for example my bone point and won 't have a footpath in front to that even though that 's a was a key walking route and so I think a public meeting would be really really useful in this case you know I 'm all in favor of those because I think the more information we can provide the the less stress there is in the community around you know what 's unknown I remember we organized a genius scientist there was one thing he said that I just cannot you know I cannot believe I didn 't hear it anytime after the earthquake switch as earthquakes do not relieve stress they redistribute stress and I just thought it 's just such a clear reason why you get aftershocks that I can 't believe that I never heard anyone say and I always remember that sometimes you know you 've got to keep saying something over and over again because somebody will be hearing it for the first time oath even though you 've seen it for the hundredth time you know but anyway that 's the thing so Paul you 'd like to move that i love it i just want to make one other comment distance these corridors are actually not just texted local corridors it is a SI route for you know that for everybody in Christ just go to our coastal areas sleemoth new brighton we got here is that people go to a bit I 've been frightened the community and frightened and it 'd be good around these public conversations around the risks and rest of crisis find out about them as well yep yanny yeah i 'm happy to second resolution to say i think in that synergy between the cycleway program the skirt program I mean they 're only doing ram repairs here anyway so they 're only patching the road they 're not doing a full reconstruction which is out of the problem and in getting the alignment to the land mass movement and and the risk the rockfall cliff collapse issues I think is really really critical it 's much better for us to just do it once and do it properly otherwise the disruption that gets cause I mean you know some of them even the local repairs have shut traffic for hours going on that really busy corridor so I think it 's good to have the public meetings but it 's actually just as important to actually turn all the different work streams of things that we want to do as a council and have a really clear decision making process around it because at the moment there 's three different types of decisions being made cycleways profitably the community board around a sort of temporary switch permanent coastal pathway things so I think the more alignment we can get with decision making and synergy so we 're making one decision and people can see clearly what the designs are the better and if we learn anything from the beach for example was it 's better to go out and consult at the start and get everyone on board rather than have something too late which in turn cost us huge amounts of other hundreds of thousands in that case yep no it 's good point karai 's also I just make a point about these public conversations including the the funding arrangements to putting faith in our community to handle that I mean the fact that skirt doesn 't do betterment and what Sarah made over the footpaths as well so you know moving into that VRU arrangement with council but that 's the best chance yeah I haven 't read the odd comment and the various places where it suggested there because scoot aren 't doing it it 's not getting done for 30 years good yes anyway um that we have to live with it so i will put that motion all those in favor say aye aye aye and now it 's okay and _"

    "text": "move to item 7 and I think item seven becomes easier to deal with sorry Paula can I invite you to the to the table gotta thank good morning um item seven yes how do you well um I have noticed that we just passed a resolution around the neck of consistency that exists in these rental things and I wondered whether under these circumstances we should look at as just rolling over the current rental arrangements for another 12 months I don 't know whether Angus that do you want to comment on it it 's not much difference yeah I balls oh yeah however I prefer to stay with the status quo while would so I think if it 's just such a small matter doesn 't matter doesn 't matter once i 'll be reviewing it yeah yeah omc was the ALCS yeah okay alright so um so if its effects okay Oh Andrews museum is super wife is I 'm here are you here you you can europe you 're an option yeah Annie did you want to oh I just want I 'm happy to long-term plan it 's got funding and so I just wanted to check whether that funding if there 's any funding impact of the decision that we 're making that 's one of the ten years through the plan on the basis of service visitor information services very tall we don 't give them at but that 's all yeah our advice was when we were doing this report that there was in line funding provided by through the council for the next ten years and that 's why we then ended up doing unilaterally with the Information Center and going through this rent review so Wendy ever and I 'm from the Information Center advised that that was there so if they had to pay a higher rent then that would come from that funding reducing any funding that they had for some of their other services right so it 's not just the rental component that 's funded no I think it was from our understanding was that it was funding provided to them to provide that service which would then include the rental or in this case yeah so set the annual roller will set the annual rent at the current rental that they pay or do you want the amount written on Oh at the current amount at the current rate yeah in the current current rate yeah full stop end of story filled with grant yep and move yani seconded no strim um yep they have it do I have a seconder for it no one agrees I 'll also get and oh can we can we also noting the review so it set the annual rent at the current rate for 12 months noting the review of the policy yeah or the development of the policy whatever the weirding us from the previous resolution just your mom captain I 've captured it and place it on a few years coming up yeah yeah that 's right alright so this question yep so at the moment there is no policy about renting rental terms to community that 's why we moved their resolution before yup yeah okay alright so previously we have been renting this up twenty percent of market friend yes what is that the point there is no standard policy and we are asking for a consistent policy on community groups not for profit etc occupying council-owned buildings or having their own buildings on council land that 's what the previous that 's why I brought it forward on the agenda yeah real good yep right I 'll put the motion officer just speak on it I 'm just happy to support this is a kind of holding pattern and just acknowledge that you know we have requested that work goes into the wider aspects so you know on one hand councils actually paying the rent anyway so where do we charge a dollar or whether we give a grant or lesser grant actually probably cost neutral to counsel but I think it is good that we 've highlighted that we do want to look at the wider policy around this I mean if you if you think about how much learning charge they 're paying more than the sports pavilion for professional sports commercial function centre in hagley park so just to put it in context we 've also got companies utilizing we have all said arts and resolutions around that so I just think we need to put it into a holding pattern and I 'm sure the group 's won 't complain if we come back with a revised for real that 's more enabling of these community type activities and the compelling thing for mayors if you just read 5.3 26 volunteers who provide 2,500 hours of interest service per year and approximately 14,000 people a year that they work with so you know it does seem even a little bit unfair to be charging 2,700 of us for a week but as I said I 'm heavy to move this today because it 's just getting into some peppermints we include a full review justice is God I will support this but I would have preferred it to read to roll over the existing lease because we are reviewing it and it just seems odd to go into a new lease or when we are reviewing it in 12 months but I don 't we 're not go into a new lease to be friends briefly not rolling over the old lease what have you got I thought we 'd agreed to roll it for a year ok well the wording is granted leases at a new lease or is that are we rolling over the old list too near that there was a new lease so that 's it 's a new lease but the relevant if it 's for a year or ten years oh no the lease is for ten years the rent is for a year but its Angus all Cathy do you want it there so the idea is to enter into a new lease so the tenant has got certainty of occupation but for the first 12 months of that leave the rent as it currently is now all the releases with community groups have got a provision in that we can allowing the ring to worth any policy that 's adopted by council so what we sang is we 're going to bring back policy on all these lease terms and conditions including rental you can adopt that than the next 12 months when we bring back the paper and we signing a 10-year lease but the rent or the lease amounts will be renegotiated within 12 months of that 10-year lease well if we be in a policy doing these clauses in these letters that allow us to align the rentals to the policy so it 's not an automatic rent review as just if the council adopts a policy around rentals for these we have the ability to change the rents and align them to a policy yeah good i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye oh as opposed they know that 's scary thank you _"

and then to gather all you can do one of 11 following the other so whatever suits you are you together or your individual okay right right I sit here yeah just come on sit up right in the middle and Carrie can join you sorry portly can join you and then you can take over and after you 've had your five minutes thank you okay can you hear me networking certain is that working it should be working I don 't know is that whipping yeah might have just pick up away but all right just be careful when you speak up a little bit okay okay hope you don 't mind I don 't have a printer so I 've had to bring my computer good morning council members thank you for this opportunity to address you all and thank you for your willingness to further discuss and investigate this have long-standing and grave grave concerns about the widespread use of glyphosate in our city and for all living beings including the water and the soil and the bees but especially for our willing men and women workers who are assigned to use glyphosate my city appointed contractors many and perhaps all of them uninformed about what they 're using and being exposed to and exposing others to as it currently stands glyphosate is an allowable product liberally liberally used around the city and in my view as a professional in medicine is negligently used but I am grateful and optimistic that the ched committee has made the recommendation in their report reporting that option to be furthered in process or policy I don 't know if it 's necessary to speak what option two is however bringing that to full council I believe there is a significant level of compromise that is not best for a widely possible public health vision nor for long-term policy it is my opinion that option three is preferable and the morally incorrect choice o is the morally correct choice excuse me this is is only an acceptable compromise for the immediate and short-term I appreciate any restriction use at this stage and hope that a clear and evident warning for our citizens is posted visibly everywhere where glyphosate is sprayed in all environments such as walkways public parks schools and playgrounds transparency about glyphosate is my concern and our public right to know about its content its danger as it 's sprayed in every area of the city and interfering in human and animal life all of the statements I make this morning can be supported with research and further documents when the council allows this item to make public consultation it might not be considered in the report that you all have put together the World Health Organization one year ago this month declare to a world that glyphosate is a probable carcinogen I think we should let that sink in again the World Health Organization has declared to the world that glyphosate is a probable carcinogen probable being the word we should probably can sitter glyphosate damages jeans at sub-lethal levels it is a hormone damaging endocrine distributor at levels not negative impacts on the reproductive system glyphosate contributes to digestive illness it disrupts gut and nutrient makes us nutrient deficient glyphosate based herbicides can exert worrying effects on antibiotics in the body and glyphosate damages the nervous system at sub lethal levels a local example of this would be a friend who runs a whole foods business in New Brighton who has been exposed to glyphosate where it 's been detected in her blood she has been suffering for over five years now as the substance has given her ongoing physical and neurological symptoms she would be here today to speak but she is still unwell from her exposure to glyphosate and she needs to run her business so that she can feed the people of New Brighton and Christchurch unsprayed food recently while walking outside of the New Brighton library to unmasked and unprotected on gloved men young men were donning their roundup backpacks and spraying the landscape all over the front of the library in the wind wheels children rode their bikes and people and pedestrians walked home from the library I was sprayed with the substance and I was outside of the beach cafe on Barbados Street in the city and as a ready to enter my vehicle a young unmasked and unloved man was spraying the gutter its weeds with Roundup he did not notice the leak in his line which was leaving a stream of glyphosate round up along the footpath where a dog was sitting and his owner the negligence in every way brought tears to my eyes and I further discussed this on my Facebook page within hours the christchurch city council recorded my discussion and removed it off my personal page feels quite undemocratic for mine yesterday I was in handsome Park picking up children a team of workers were spraying the perimeter of the park with children hide in play as they enter and exit a nearby school these examples have been every day all day in 2016 there is no shortage of information across the world that glyphosate is dangerous the available independent medical research and science are not funded by Monsanto and the likes is enough to make me wonder if the Christchurch City Council should prepare itself for policy to ban glyphosate not be considered in the meanwhile shouldn 't the public and our workers have the right to know what they 're being exposed to and should work in safety take complete responsibility to provide transparency about what glyphosate is total exposure risks and damages to these chemicals are now being determined as we know from the recent research at massey of the incidents where horticultural workers exposed to pesticides had a higher chance of getting candles even New Zealand science is now showing us that people exposed to certain chemical toxins in herbicides fungicides and pesticides risk higher have higher risk of certain diseases such as lymphoma and Hodgkins I come from the United States and I 've lived here for 10 years as far back as 2400 policy change thus banning all risky and rapid or risking dangerous pesticides from places where children play where people picnic where we walk our dogs where we grow food and where bees forage Portland Oregon Seattle Washington are two significant metropolitan examples of who have pesticide-free parks and playground 17 Pacific Northwest cities in the United States of proudly pesticide-free parks and playgrounds alternatives to glyphosate are used elsewhere nine hundred villages towns and municipalities in France have restricted and banned life was saved Norway France the Netherlands Sweden are all pushing back their policy for use of glyphosate Barcelona has gone spray free our local EPA uses old chemical company has applied science and research industry information not acceptable anymore it 's 2016 and the veil is lifted there are other alternatives to glyphosate such as scheme waiting hot water treatment plant oil and fatty acid based herbicides these technologies have always existed and other counselors and contracts throughout New Zealand are already implementing them with good information and investigation you 're likely to find cost comparisons that are better than what the current budget spends on these dangerous chemicals other technologies are used and Representatives using them in Auckland and other plates in the world are willing to come to New Zealand to support the possibility of us using these cost-competitive depending chemicals depending costs comparative other alternatives depending on the level of service we require I 'm just reluctant to interrupt but we 've gone you okay thank you I bet the choice should not be fiscal the choice should not be fiscal the use of glyphosate samee seems a human rights issue and a noticeable environmental rights at you I thank you as a concerned citizen who works in medicine as a teacher of children and adults as a beekeeper as a gardener as a woman it is my deepest purpose and my utmost responsibility and all of ours to protect all life from harm and the risky behavior that this wrought widespread use of glyphosate already is as my representatives I expect you to make the most informed decisions about the further use of glyphosate in Christchurch based on current and independent research and science and Investigation that you take a stand for help being our well-being and the safety of everyone in our community and our environment and not for a budget thank you thank you very much okay cool move amazing thank you carry that was well very well said thank you everybody for giving me the opportunity to speak today I only found out about this meeting this public forum I wanted to say carrie has spoken to all the statistics and the the data around the use of this product so i want to speak from a personal as from a personal perspective as a concerned resident of littleton so driving home up countably street one day I saw that it was spraying down littleton a few months ago and two men on four-wheelers with big white buckets of liquid on their rails whispering every weed in sight whether that weed was a menace to the area or to the eyes or not one of the men made his way up my street sprang as he went and stopped at a lookout for e-cigarette stopped it a look out for a cigarette just next to my house so I walked up to him and I said could you tell me what you 're spraying please wanting to know what his genuine answer was and he said it 's just round up I said it 's not just round up it 's not just round up this stuff is a known toxin to plant life to waterways and two people profit and money maker of a company Monsanto that I despise so I pointed to my house and I said please don 't spray me there I don 't consent to poisons being sprayed around my home and my family the frustration of this scenario was that this man was just doing his job and I recognized so and I told him that so I wasn 't taking my frustration out on him but I was just alluding to the fact of what he was sprinting and the problem lies with the council or the perhaps responsibility lies with the council or city care in adopting this practice of using glyphosate as its go to strategy for removing weeds Kari has just spoken to all the data you don 't need me to fill you in on that it 's been widely documented but the great issue that I take with them is that by using roundup in favor of all other methods of we control that have been implemented sex successfully in other communities that carried us to spoken to by using round up there is a willful poisoning all you are making the decision on behalf of the people that live in these communities that in order to maintain the areas that they use and occupy you 're going to poison it perhaps it 's for budget perhaps it 's resource perhaps there 's not enough manpower to implement different strategies but on top of that you 're also making a decision on behalf of these communities that the city needs to look perfect with the road side or the circumference at the base of a beautiful big tree or a schoolyard cannot have any shoots of life growing from it that the council itself hasn 't planted and manicured i live in littleton a pretty edgy and funky community i personally am not offended by the odd weed growing out of the or alongside my walking track and in fact I eat half of them I put them in my smoothies I follow John my morning walk I make pesto there 's abundant parsley growing along the hopper down the line for example is a powerful blood cleanser I would rather have a medicine for the liver me cancer that 's used to kill it we need to rethink our priorities please we need to rethink our priorities in a time now where the toxicity of our environment is such an immediate concern to so many of us whether it 's the state of our soil our waterways or the air we breathe I find that archaic the council such as Christchurch would still use this method in order to keep up appearances christchurch has been in the international spotlight since 2011 and for good reason it 's an amazing city the TimeBank in littleton has drawn worldwide attention for how it banded together as a community to support the community when everything fell upon the gap filler has provided amazing spaces due to the ingenuity and the creativity of a few members of the community ordinary members of the public of the christchurch public that decided that space is needed to be filled when we had no spaces left that also draw public attention now this talk of it becoming an edible city an edible garden city where there is food growing along the public spaces is pretty inspiring so let 's continue to forge ahead as a city of inspired action let 's fight let 's find solutions collectively that will protect our environment because at this stage in the game we simply cannot afford not to when I go for a walk with my eight-year-old stepson and he reaches for a while Barry along the tracks of the port hills or anywhere around christchurch and i tell him not to read it because that area will have been spurred that is a start sad state of affairs let 's not have it continue let 's look for solutions thank you for allowing me to speak thank you very much indeed for coming thank you and thank you for speaking unless you that 's really important what we 're going to do there is another request for a speaker dr. Elvira Denise yeah and so we 'll listen to dr alvaro and then we have some more public public education we 've got other public deputation right so just so you guys are aware of what 's happening and when we 'll deal with this that are pre booked and then we 'll go straight to the glyphosate issue after that so in about yeah ok you set this up this morning yes yeah so we have we 'll listen to dr alvaro moniece now and then we have other people who want to make deputations and then we 'll go straight on to the glyphosate issue ok so you guys are free to go and sit down and enjoy your brand coffee or whatever you want to do thank you very much for coming Thank You Vicky and right you know the rules we 've got five minutes generally yes sure yeah think about thank you I 'd nothing is it coming through ok yeah i 'm just going to approach it from a scientific perspective and i 'm going to talk about the metabolic effects of glyphosate and already gloves like is in our diet in a lot of ways because coiffeur so it 's used as a spray it when farmers want to have a uniform harvest like they 'll just spray a whole crop of wheat and a little fall down 's at a different stage so it 's an hour wait it 's an all our process foods that have GMOs and then because glyphosate is the main spray that 's used on GMO crops so it 's currently in our diet in a way that is affecting public health now it 's very difficult to mana public health when you don 't have a study in place and this is such a widespread health issue right throughout Western world that it 's hard to see it an experiment with humans because we 're not laboratory animals but I 'm going to take it right back to the seventies when glyphosate actually came out as metabolic because it was it what it does is it inhabits this pathway an enzyme pathway called the sugar mate pathway and that 's in most bacterial infec gradually all bacteria and it 's in plants but it 's not an animals and it 's not in humans so miles had to sit right this is not go no oh sorry it came in as an antibiotic and then by accident was discovered it was code make this is a weed killer what they didn 't say they they because it was when I was working at coppin food I would have inferred from number of years and we work with glyphosate and everyone said and we believed it at the time glyphosate is the safest who who decide there 's no other one that 's safer so you 're going to use won 't use glyphosate said everybody was using glyphosate it was everywhere home gardeners do still but always we 're using it from that time onwards but they didn 't say and they always knew was there cuz it inhibits this bacterial in destroys this bacterial enzyme pathway it inhibits and destroys bacterial pathways in your gut and it particularly inhabits the species of bacteria in your gut there are the probiotic bacteria and once the probiotic bacteria are gone your gut is basically lifeless and you are unable to absorb nutrients properly unable to process your food properly and then that leads to lots of chronic inflammatory conditions and temperature bowel disease Crohn 's disease it 's linked with a lot I 'm going to refer to my quick notes which I made an awful hurry this morning 's only warning I 'm going to go through my points now Monsanto claims that round of harmless to animals and humans because its mechanism of action called an imputation inhabit inhibition of the sugar mate pathway is absent in animals however the sugar mate pathway is present and bacteria including the bacteria the beneficial bacteria that live and the gut and glyphosate as I just explained for pre freely preferentially effects beneficial bacteria allowing pathogens to overthrow and take them when pathogens overgrown take over you get diseases also like Canada and you can also get cancer developing because there 's not that regulation of the cell division that happens when you 've got the probiotic bacteria keeping everything in check in the gut and I 'm sure that you know the gut is described as a stick and brain and things that go wrong in the gut can affect and do affect the brain and there 's also a lot of speculation in the research literature about the link with autism dizzy and hit and hereditary inherited form and there is the form that is attributed to exposure to toxins and the environment and the autism percentage in the population has has hugely increased I haven 't got the figures I 'm come to me i 'm sorry but you could look them up since the advent of using glyphosate wide widely and food and in the environment once chronic and information sets in you 're well on your way toward chronic and potentially debilitating disease and a small list of the diseases and this is a paper and a journal called intro p and the authors are dr. CF and dr. sense so IM got details and serve it i can find them out and glyphosate is possibly the most important factor and the development of multiple chronic diseases and conditions that have become prevalent in Western societies and these include autism allergies cancer cardiovascular disease depression Alzheimer 's and fertility gastrointestinal which is the irritable bowel colitis Crohn 's disease in chronic diarrhea obesity because you can 't produce your food properly and also inhibits the absorption of minerals magnesium and liquor mcnees ian is linked to heart disease in other muscular problems multiple sclerosis and Parkinson 's disease now I could go on but I don 't really think I want to because i think that there 's enough information there for you to realize and also that there does all these chronic inflammatory diseases associated with you 'll get back to your not working basically you got back to you don 't work you don 't work and the other thing is i used to work for the council in gore my father was the foreman of parks in reserves and he was in charge of all the public plantain to the gardens in all the plots and i worked on the plots and we didn 't know sprain we did all hoeing and you live to Ho really quick pitch in the bucket in the bucket now I 've watched the guy spraying down domain terrace on the domain sprayed into May and I think it 's called because it 's where I love and you know they have to walk spray or spray well it got a sharp hoe to go and stick it in your bucket and I 'm a keen gardener and I never ever hear of and never will use the need to because I 've got a good organic system going and it 's not really a matter of oh dear this is going to cost an awful lot of money the awful lot of money that you might save and being able to spray is gonna stick the problem elsewhere it 's going to stick it into the health budget you know because you 're going to have health problems as a result of this so it 's kind of just saying oh well it 's not our problem it 's the health department 's problem and also it looks ugly if you want to be proud of a garden city that 's green and then you have these yellow buijs everywhere I have to say it looks really ugly and my father used to say I 'm never using it because it looks so like yeah there with your age Clippers all you weed eaters or whatever when you look and it never looks good not at the yellow station or the brown stage in and they don 't take the old brown weeds away anyway so it 's awfully messy and I hope I 've made sense to you and I think listening thank you very very much indeed for coming over very much appreciated thank you I 'm related so we 're now into the deputations by appointment and this is are you all coming forward who 's coming for first two wrong Runa is there a debate about how many are coming do we need to get you some more seats no that 's good usually yeah Cora and welcome in your hands already a commando myotonic Oaxaca

it belongs to all of us the peppy how recited gives me that the right to stand here and talk on behalf of the farmer corporator to me we have an occupation in the Bay of over 800 years forty two generations wrote The Who Adam um with the answer worked out of people we even go back further we are people with it become come set right a Papa comes the right of responsibility we accept that we acknowledge in the boat we are they are we have a monofin ama the acknowledged at the wider community in the bay are the target ephemera the people of their place it encompasses everyone in our community when our responsibility we asked of them what we asked of ourselves the responsibility that comes with proper and this is what we 're here to test that issue too yes you today the relationship of the council has been based on exactly that community we have had riparian fencing and planting areas that we had a longer protected meetings of the council with whea fest we have climate we have you created a walkway up to have to pune po and with the intention of barbecue for barbecues be placed down on the beach area for the use of the general public the taxi here acapella memory and also acknowledges out out no respect for the wider community we are also in the process building a funny one manner which is a environmental school there 's an incentive which coming from us but as part of a whole community it will it will be focus our relationships for example with lincoln university we have ganic horticultural program and progress with the myriad of other agencies we have good other universities in the sea fight cpit for example also we have acquired Laban 's based school we have built out ourselves this is in conjunction with control consultation with in lavon 's bay community we will support their environmental projects within the bait and we will work together what are their as everybody else victim a little more calm and normal he says the marty cordova earthquakes or volcanoes we lost their ability to set up our aquaculture academy which we had a dilemma for what is it sir NZQA we wish to behave Laban 's to become a part of their we have a lease agreement with the local community which consists of one dollar per year plus GST and we insist on getting their strategy on the one dollar this is how close relationship before me I reiterate all this because see the future of Corcovado data and everyone in the bay who is the legal right to be there and I emphasize that we reach the stage now after 70 years enough is enough we wish to have our land back we wish to be able to use it in conjunction with our projects within the community which are not just corcovado self-interested as it 's obviously the explanation of giving you a wider a vision and moyamoya which is a beautiful Marty phrase which incorporates the ability to BL see into the future but incorporate all it 's time for that place to go it 's as simple as that we must have removed they 're not interested in time table we wish the power poles which been which are legally honor lemming we said to be gone as well we are totally insulted by a long job difficult on on land which is because it is an impasse the symmetry is why Tottenham enough is enough we are learning to sit as I said on a timetable I don 't intend to go on much much more because have the back thinking about a week we have the backing of our community we are actually speaking here on behalf of community as well they 've asked us to does not merely merely because of the family tamannaah farah you other thing that the fennel we wish i wish to acknowledge the father the finally funding of core quad auditor they 've handled themselves with dignity and respect through this process i love i admire the the strength of our young people not to take matters in my own hands let me see what 's happening the absolute insult of nothing else to have the right of every New Zealander to control and discipline on your own land why are we differed I respect the acknowledging the fact that the clouded political issues which are which which have kind of place there is some kind of smokescreen it 's nothing to do with us this is about private land and college commandeering lane of all New Zealanders I want to ignore it 's the hurt of our come back to up having to put up to the history the a certain generation yes calm there 's no there 's no relationship it hasn 't been for a long long time the hurt of all human feces on wait up and land that 's the huge insult in the Maori world I also remember the hood will we took back the news from the last presentation that were with one year of our to promote giving giving the opportunity for the use of the land that sold it within one year you know in the morning while we struggle at times to understand ways of the party our world that is a huge insult again where was given was not given to this fair that was from the statements that they gave on the day it was passed on that 's quite simple I acknowledge that the head of the car mod two are having to listen to that kind of corneal in closing I want to thank my time for supporting on this it is quite a simple method to us we wish to have our L now our rut in the world of ela e and the world a right on the run freehold land in philly please do not acknowledge is perhaps in the past you have put matters being mistaken for weakness far from it as i said we have 800 years and 42 generations of occupation on the we tend to exercise that right they are not interested in any timeline timeline as far as we consume is tomorrow got a doctor conductive done let me he had 20 yokocho katoa my name is chris ford i 'm the general counsel at telling it all in that tahoe and i 'm standing here on behalf of the Erie to give support to our papa te Runanga colleagues good orator and to be clear the two outcomes that are being sought a one the removal of the batch from the coca our tool and it 's got no legal right to be the it 's got no permission to be there and that 's something that will be working directly with coca Tara two on and two removal of the batch from the legal rose again there 's no legal right to be there and poker the cats on the community boards to address that and then the decision we 're seeking as the council to to remove their batch we believe that the decision of your community board the legal advice your staff advise all support their outcome and as peter has said and showing all option available to them and to achieve the earthly stated aims so thank you for your time and look forward to a positive decision today okay um the time has elapsed for us to consider the Sun sorry we 've had a number of deputations this morning that went agenda so yeah can I just thank you for coming and making the presentation we have heard your heartfelt representations in terms of the history and the decision that we have today it 's item 39 on our agenda so we will be getting to it later in the day I 'm sorry I can 't bring it forward because we have agreed to bring the glass of eight decision forward because of the number of submissions that came in on that we made an undertaking that we would do item 39 and so I can 't move it forward until I have that advice with me and yeah and I 'm expecting the advice soon and I 'm sorry about that but it was just whether the family had been notified of the presentation this morning I have to be even-handed despite the the argument that you made from a legal point of view so I 'm sorry that I can 't move straight to item 39 but we could advise you when we know when it 's coming up on the agenda and that would then enable you to be here for the for the debate itself and it may be that witness soon we 'll be able to provide you with a time that we will aim for well thank you very much _"

    "text": "aged 57 on your bond the supplementary agenda that was circulated to counselors would you like to start with a bit of an overview I think in in touching long you know perhaps your own views about or advice to us in relation to you know that the alternative to glass V use and and and the preference to go down that track when we 're talking about public spaces thank you so the team has been working over the last couple of months to investigate essentially who is doing what around the country what seems to have worked when the alternatives have been considered and appropriately utilized to come up with a an option for the council to consider which if the council has a desire to move away from utilizing glyphosate in our public spaces and end on our council properties that may not be public spaces what is an option that we pose the least risk in terms of risk to level of service or expected public understanding of what our immunity spaces should in fact look like and be presented like the init dohtal evidence that they have trialed other alternative non-chemical methodologies seems to be that simply switching from one methodology to another in relatively short timeframes usually at 12 months or less the results haven 't been great from a public and perception point of view and that 's simply about the perceived level of service that shall be provided in other words in simple words the place looks untidy it 's not working from what we can gather and to enter be frank councils haven 't they 're not scientific organizations they don 't necessarily log and research how that how changes are managed and results are being delivered but anecdotally and that 's why option two is presented the way it is without investing in the existing asset to bring it fully up to specification and or modify the quality and quantity of what we have in other words we have a whole lot of gardens that are in poor condition unless you deal with that you 're likely to get the same outcome from the public which is a negative response in terms of what 's now how about the council two talks about the need for capital investment to get our gardens in particular up to standard and war reduce if needed will change the structure of some of those Gardens so that we can manage less in a bit awake and we will need to be an ongoing commitment to that more manual approach with regard to alternative products and John may wish to comment on this and he certainly knows a lot more about this than I do there is no silver bullet there is a range of options that we can consider the edge you 'll send a report the two organic is often thrown out there and it 's it 's it 's a marketing mechanism as opposed to a scientific one but the fatty acids as we 've referred to them in this report which is in pine oils they are effective in certain situations but they also have negative attributes as well such as Oda cannot enter any waterway so not suitable in storm anywhere near a stormwater system etc etc and so we can 't simply just swap a product for a product it to this solution so hence our recommended option is the council to consider an alternative and that that would need to go through the annual planning and consultation process we have attempted and we 're going to have this shot to present an option that will provide the least risk to the communities understanding of what an appropriate level of service will be in other words we should be able to keep things tidy but it can 't does come with risk for some of the some of the units in terms of very it could increase costs for the transport department for example that they haven 't quantified yet which is more mechanical means lightning more traffic management and they 're not really able to quantify that for us at this stage so there 's a few unknowns that it consists in to bear in mind as well right and it John did you want to add anything no but very ready to try to help our discussion here today with engagement and okay questions first term oh let 's just go around the table shall we because 'm looking at option to an option 3 and i 'm looking at the what 's described as a slight increase in costs between option to an option 3 also 3 is slightly more expensive and what 's described as a minor risk of not meeting levels of service for option two which is then described in option 3 just with it with a comment that says that also increases slightly with option 3 given the limited differences between option 2 + option three from a financial and practical point of view but certainly referring to the deputations that we 've heard this morning the significant advantage in option 3 of eliminating glyphosate use all together are you able to explain a little bit more clearly why the recommendation is that if we 're interested in making change if we 're considering making change the recommendation is for option two rather than option 3 I 'll give a brief overview and John might be able to give it a bit more background essentially well what we 're presenting to you an option two is that we would like to retain no public access where is the the most practical and in many cases the least toxic chemical that we can use to manage pests plants and that really also explains why there 's an increase in risk to levels of service because it 's going to be marginally more expensive not not a huge expense hence the costs look very similar but in terms of the products that we will need to apply to manage controlled pest species we will have to step away from glyphosate and use more toxic chemicals so John you might be able to yes I think add a bit more context thank you very what we 've heard this morning is obviously the public face if you like if glyphosate use close to built-up areas but this this distinction between option to an option three anger and I discussed this at length is described other leave as a slight difference but i think it 's concentrated in those areas the difference where we 're talking about the use of glyphosate for controlling high priority Hess plans that we are required to control so we 've city but there 's a top-25 or there 's no set cutoff as the top 25 we 're trying to control at the moment so radically or to contain the reason we do that is that if we don 't do that then our natural areas are indigenous plants are rare plants are going to suffer long-term they 're going to start to suffer immediately and we will lost any ground that we 've been able to make over the last few years since the pest plan was signed off by council so although it 's described as a slight it might be slight averaged across the holder city but i think the inability to use glyphosate for the control of these high priority pest plans is going to have a major effect in these localized areas away from residential localities more in the regional parks so that would be the that would be the difference between those two you keep Tim um okay so on on a different tick with that health and safety with the sprays etc anecdotally we 've heard that we 've got contractors not using conscious we are the owner of the job is whether contractors have a standard a safety at the answer straight answer is yes and without going into detail yes that does occur the contractors response is that they don 't want to frighten the public so essentially they don 't want to be seen in public spaces wearing the appropriate equipment because it actually it gives off quite a scary image so that 's the answer to it rena so that else like the staff need to be protected yeah absolutely and they should be and and all of our contractor managers should be insisting on but we should be publicly graphic that big Japan people they move if they 've got a nice track but but yeah I 'm kind of surprised at that because if we know you that it 's not being enforced but it 's required I mean it 's something seen something I should get I suppose it 's kind of not a really strong commitment and health and safety on either side of that contract here to say hmm that 's fair comment okay you referred Jonathan to the challenges in the regional parks but if for example the chemicals would be substituted for using real eaters in terms of excess a what what we the difference and could we could we not provide a grip a good level of service that way control the pest parameter to use the rear by way of using say for example manual or weed eaters we 've got a real problem there because based on experience that we 've gained you know dedicated conscientious people in working for the City Council have gained over the last few years is that some of these plants are extremely difficult kind of all you can chop the head off but the rest of it just grows back and so you 're looking for something which is going to stop the regrowth of the class so the glyphosate works particularly well in this respect where you can actually remove the shoot and white the stem many of these important pest plants don 't grow back the other method we 've used as well as we 've extremely large plant so we 're growing to remove these pests plans is to drill into the stem and put the glyphosate into the plant that way the huge advantage of these methods is that we don 't have to disturb the precious vegetation that grows very close intimately with these plans and so the glyphosate offers us it 's almost the only chemical and I would say it is the only chemical that is able to do this to remove these very serious pest plans which threaten our native biodiversity without disturbing the local environment the the plant has killed the herbicide is not taken up by the surrounding plans to go to a manual technique it would be apart from the cost which would be astronomical their dangers and damage to the indigenous vegetation and individual species close to the test plans would very damaging gives a huge risk into our you know being able to fulfill our community outcome of looking after and protective native biodiversity okay thanks John David look I don 't have any questions or comments to make I probably want to signal a desire to move an amendment is a risk assessment by government authorities worldwide in 2016 that we adopted option one until that assessments memo I have some comments that I 'd make them debate I 'll hold those traps I 'm a little wander the second to get your kind of the question stays quiet no wonder if the if the resolutions carried then it 's it 's not required to foreshadow that motion and efforts lost then it 's the that is the case so yeah I mean it says just status was carried no no if I 'm putting the motion that 's the recommendation on the pan the paper I 'm not putting option one first I 'm but I 'm saying that option one will be the case of options whichever when we go for is lost because we will be with the status quo and clean thank you more questions about how widespread is the use of glyphosate in the residential red zone amongst the contract to the year that might be Cranley but there is a red green zone interface that is the basis of my well it is what 's going on there in terms of glyphosate use other than where our parks or properties that we manage order the red zone and essentially what we 've detailed in the report applies which here which I can go into if you wish well I do the no public access is some curious over that statement particular you know the notary public access really refers to John 's comments of the regional park rangers working in areas where we don 't have public tracks etc but we are required to manage his plans it also applies to situations where although it doesn 't have to wear it would be where we might be doing major capital works and we would have a closed environment if we had to manage plants in that way so there 'd be no public to access at that time okay thank you well I might we 'll see how the debate goes a Mesa just something that I brought some two or three ally yeah I just had a question on page 59 my understanding was that there was money and me a draft the implementation of option one am i misunderstanding that it says here that in fact just 2.5 million is in the draft annual plan leaving 3.35 unbudgeted it 's in over two years so I seem to have different page numbering but term I think we have the committee patient it 's in the budget over a two-year period as a good recommendation that we have in front of us is that we go out to consultation with a public via the draft and you can on the proposal so the detail will be all spelt out in the draft Daniel plan when we yeah but what I 'm concerned about is the draft annual plan apparently budgets only for 2.5 million but it 's a cost of 5.8 5 million per annum leaving 3.35 unbudgeted so as I understand it and not sure where Peter is its enemy it 's budgeted for in the draft and your plan it 's Jason over a two-year period that Jason Jason Jason Richardson licensee thank you yes and the drafting of playing there was a sorry great let legal and we 've a matter for the draft annual plan its mobile and the amendment of the LTP the consultation document so it really won 't be consulted well that 's audits advice right if we follow that advice what I suggested as we say consult was a tablet via the drive 10 he will play in consultation process right we can work out hair yeah yeah yeah ok so now Jason okay this came out a month or so ago and counselors and at the time we wanted to put something in the annual plan and since the draft to attention to the ltp amendment and so 2.5 million of the capital was put in as a one-off so it 's not over two years it 's just as a one-off amount in two million dollars of operational funding was put in as well obviously Andrew and his team have gone away under a lot more researcher on this and so the careful not based requirements are a lot clearer an hour and that is what is included in the consultation document yeah so if we move past the one year if money budgeted beyond that one year that 's correct and what does that equate to anna rates increase look the operational stuff i know is point two five percent the capital money tree mail in fpga minor and a bit looking at point o 1 point 0 2 percent on rates because it but all family in this very because we borrowed for it so it 's very like okay and my last question as we heard from the submitters the concerns obviously about the the chemical but what I want to know is we 're hearing about those concerns that are and forgive me i 'm not being derogatory here perhaps exaggerated as a result of not best practice or rather you know best practice not being used so we do about when we heard about lack of masks and so forth but also my understanding is that even though the chemical has been identified as probably carcinogenic to humans the use of it reduces that risk to the public the correct use of it would that be fair you 'd be fair to say that the very authoritative think what other agencies worldwide have argued is that there needs to be a proper assessment of risk in other words what is the risk that people are going to be exposed to that hazard and that 's why I suspect I mean I 've put in as clear words as I can the assessment of world authorities that 's why in fact there 's a microscope being held up a glyphosate at the moment a risk has been established that is probably cut again to humans but in order for that risk to make itself known it has speaks most of humans and so if the product is used according to manufacturer 's recommendations and all health and safeties adhered to especially if that products not actually applied closed to the public or reserved in closed areas or in place as well away from the public are likely to be exposed to it then the risk becomes much smaller so as can service is already indicated this is currently being debated by people who understand far more than than any of us probably can in a wider sphere try we speak at the moment but those those assessments haven 't come down yet or we have as authorities in New Zealand the Environmental Protection Authority and Australia and other countries as well recognizing hey this is important nobody 's trying to hide anything here nobody 's trying to pull the wool over our eyes but we do need to allow those authorities to make their assessment before we need to necessarily jump in that fashion nonetheless we were recommending option two as a precautionary approach it 's a responsible and transfer addressing of the subject I think you it felt to me like it was a it was a balanced approach yeah and Paul look at after hearing the questions and a very good report I 've got nothing else like I think I can make a decision on there we put up early today right yani oh yeah thank you um got several questions one I just wanted to check what the impact is on our existing contracts we 've got contracts with existing contractors to do work in certain ways how do we then move to a I can 't speak off the cuff on behalf of every contract that utilizes glyphosate than it but certainly from a parks perspective and the supplies in most contractual situations the principle being counseled can negotiate modifications to what we call the quality plan which is the annual agreement of Cal work will be carried out there will need to be renegotiation of rates applicable to change methodologies and that 's essentially what translates to the estimated cost within this behind us okay effectively do we put any contracts that jeopardy if we just to do that I don 't believe so um the second question I had was around the point that was made which I tend to have a lot of sympathy for was actually particularly around some of our waterways it does not extraordinarily unkempt and actually looks quite quite awful so you know the rest that you 've identified where things might look untidy I was just interested to understand that a bit more given that you know I guess particularly this summer we 've had huge compliance around the general state of Road corridors and look very attractive at all so just in terms of our garden city image and in terms of keeping things tidy yeah and the submit at the point that the sort of made what 's your kind of response to that look I 'm going to give you a relatively subjective rather than objective answer and and that is based on the fact that the methodologies proposed as an alternative will require more physical presence from people and so an attention to detail the likely outcome of that is if you like the image that that projects to the public will be positive yeah things could get a bit tricky is in our in Christchurch we always experience a pretty intense growth flush and pick in the in the spring months for two months and we 're likely to see a little bit of concern expressed at that time but that will even out so more people doing more manual things more often and more attention to detail is likely to have a positive response from the pub overall you 're just a final question from me was just in liability I mean I am concerned around the health and safety but we also heard from the submitters around the risk of having people exposed so heavily thought anything about you know what out what our liability could potentially be and also thought about any sort of wider issues around actually advocating perhaps banning public sales of the product etc and I might get you to repeat the last part of the question but in terms of health and safety I look I think what we should as officers should take from this discussion even today is that we need to ensure that the contractor applies all appropriate mechanisms and methodologies to to guarantee the safety of their personnel the reaction to that will be they 'll push back and we 're likely to get that reaction of the public seeing people wearing full respirator equipment when they 're doing their work currently so there will be a negative reaction to that notwithstanding that from a health and safety perspective we need to go down that line I was just more meaning the public so I mean that 's I then meeting the health and safety of lligat but in terms of the public liability for us as counselors around using a car surgeon in public space jaani jaani jaani jaani knowing that you 've read the report in detail I don 't need to remind you that option one makes it clear that there are internationally regarded organizations who are checking list this is a this is that we 're taking a position here that other councils haven 't adopted and I feel that it 's going to go through there is no public there is no liability to come back on our council for doing what other councils have done when here is a proper process in place internationally to assess the risk everyone agrees on the the probability of the cosmic carcinogenic nature of the product and you know I think this is a precautionary approach so I don 't think we 're going to be criticized for going down this track well except that we 've heard how it 's been operationally handled but I would absolutely I know but that 's it that is the that actually bluntly horrified and I think I 've made the point that 's been acknowledged and the steps are going to be taken to make sure that the contractors live up to their obligations what we 've been quite rightly informed of by staff is that there will be pushed from the public of feathers in the public arena so the sooner we get on to passing the resolution we can get on to getting it out of the public arena all together right breath yeah just a quick one so is there any really solid evidence from local authorities that have gone spray free in terms of how it 's worked out I mean I 'll see there was a reference to devonport and Waikiki and they even the most assiduous gardeners often resort to the nuclear option occasionally to to get rid of weeds that are hard to get rid of so I mean we have any good evidence on the long lasting effects well in terms of clear evidence I guess the most obvious clear evidence is it costs more and the way Auckland Council operates that 's provided across the entire city and then the individual local boards make a decision as to whether or not they will fund a different methodology and the two that have been doing that historically the longest are the Devonport in waikiki island they do occasionally resort to sorry I 'll just step back there talking about chemical free so oil products they do occasionally on in certain circumstances through publicly notify process revert to occasional chemical use in terms of evidence that nice councils haven 't really collected a lot of information about how effective change methodologies had been other than what I mentioned at the beginning which is that lack of investment leads to problems they can 't keep up and they tend to flip flop from one methodology to another or back to glyphosate in a way it 's there 's not much more I can give you on edge and overseas overseas in again it 's it 's fairly anecdotal and if you like a local government collied in town have did a lot of research in terms of what 's going on in France products at all a lot of if it is going into changing people 's expectations about what their public spaces will look like the same thing is happening in the some bars in the USA there 's a lot of emphasis on what you might call as wild as okay so essentially what what a lot of people will interpretive as weeds are being left to grow and it 's it 's more about changing public perception so there again I think it 's an that 's the public view of the Wheaton and many of the pest plants are in obscure areas obscure at the moment but you don 't really want to turn you back on because they 'll be all over us when we want to go into the parks and we really want to get away from our city streets that 's the test class which I 'm particularly concerned about to thank you I 'm just before I get 20 questions thanks and run time for a really comprehensive informative report and art and the advice has been great so thank you for addressing it just going back to the under health and safety procedures do we give resonant and stipulated that contractors are to adhere to these health and safety procedures of wherein this protective gear it 's implicit in the contracts the way it works is that councils responsibility is to assess what they present through the tender point out any shortcomings address those and then it 's it 's the responsibility of the contractor to implement and our responsibility is to essentially quality ashore or audit if you like and I think we 've already highlighted that that 's that 's been lacking and that needs to be addressed have we have we said to them that we 've repaired weird give and carrying out this work I guess I can 't speak on behalf of every contract manager but it 's implicit in our contracts that we that they follow the Equality sreenath again I can 't guarantee that they 've been doing that in many cases they probably haven 't it the reason why I say that Madame ear is that I feel from our position as a governor here we when we have a contract or or contractors you know we have obligations and if they are to adhere to health and safety procedures it 's not an option for them you either do it or you don 't they 're pushback is irrelevant and I couldn 't give a hoot whether they think it will scare kids or people nearby if they don 't do it they don 't have a job really simple you know and so I 'm gobsmacked to hear that we have these procedures here just because health and safety particularly in light of the X you know we need to take this so seriously and you know it 's not done for a life they 're driving a vehicle they wear seatbelts they 're working at height they have harnesses and if they 're working with us sort of stuff we know where the protective gear yeah we intubate yeah that 's not a question no it 's not a question yes and it 's not a big another quick and the other thing is it 's not a debate it 's not debate yet no I 'm anyway some any pets or milk but secondly I mean it needs to be rectified the only other comment I heard the question around it being an LTPS you are not an annual plan issues I I was under the impression that endures just my own clarity that effectively um isn 't any amendment to the long-term plan quite literally what the annual plan is for no no we 've got a due process but I don 't think you 've been connected to it as closely as as others but the annual plan process can be minor you know amendments but the ltp process of the significant amendments that we have to consult on so we use a special consulted procedure during the annual plan process so we will have a consultation document because we 're amending the long-term plan so you procedure yep we short colored where I was getting to this so so from where I 'm explicit yeah so because there is you know there 's a there 's a rating implication it will be at minimal for the for the you were to go down the path of the option to so there would be an obligation to consult through the annual plan process okay cool yeah crystal clear absolutely and and will be blunt will tell people where specifically making this proposal and it will enable people to particularly respond in issue cool just just saying I don 't have anyone and ruin the again just please him a through that health and safety stuff to the guys it 's just the entries made that clear yes let me do the Queen my questions to Jamie the second appreciate particular concern der the rotation pequeno will be publicly I just want to know how detailed the information for Easton ago methodology or maybe pace to control in the proper way or management put into the a neoprene or that 's something that we need to deal with in terms of the consultation to all know that will be coming to counsel on 21st marks for sign off and public release for consultation but we may have the option in the inner pen or just chose it please your live okay that 's the one that will be in there just just the impact of glyphosate in the waterways as i understand it doesn 't break down and measure there 's what happens to it once it gets into Flame I understand that that 's not applied so that can get in the waterways which is why the roads people don 't want to go straight down into the drain into the water okay so thanks I understand that glyphosate is a dieta sticks very firmly to the soil particle surface to the soil material should never be applied we met to be raining or is about to rain or any of those things good all right so it would someone like to move their counsel sorry the recommendation from the committee United lucky um I 'm my preference is actually option three but I 'm happy to go with option two to get this underway what I would like to perhaps suggest in addition to it is that in two years were in a year so we come back with a further report on how we could actually get compete to continue their investigations on to alternative methods of managing she 's these issues because and report back in the next couple of years so and by that time you should have the International Research Republican yeah I would suspect there 'll be a lot more information about yeah so that would said it would that would tie in really well and I would like that too i think that that then sets up the next council to actually have a further review and but you 've already started going down a track that takes it away from its high risk well you 've taken you immediately work to take it away from the very public interface yep that it currently has because i 've also seen glyphosate been applied i saw it as recently as tuesday and riccarton and person during the glyphosate no gloves no nothing and just normal strolling along and another person 's getting the lawn right beside the wind was blowing there were people nearby it was horrifying actually I find it terrifying because although we could suit up the people applying it the treat on the staff whose dogs walk on as an income aside and our all equally exposed to product and the difficulty I have is that it is so ubiquitous we have this view that roundup which is sold freely throughout going and approved by our EPA based on 2009 information which is pretty amazing and itself given how much information has come out about this product since then abandoned France been in the Netherlands and currently having a huge fight trying to get a real license in the EU in fact they postponed the decision yesterday when they met for the whole of the EU I think we actually have to take the canary measures I don 't think we 'd aunty we want to debate oh well thanks to expose tips are adults anyone arby 's anything to the impact of this we know what it does we we know it 's listed as a probable carcinogen we would always we put 40k speed limits around schools we try to put psycho ways and speech in separate locations of an eye cannot see just from a pure community continue on our roads and our sports fields because it 's used and our context it 's allowed city care use it Delta use it I just pretty much everywhere and the impacts of what we 're building up horrific I actually recall the botanic gardens and the case of been late which wasn 't at that case at that time band and I recorded that child space who is gone without eyes and I can still see it actually clearly is anything so i think we always from a health and safety from the community viewpoint need to be as safe and as healthy as we can and what we 're exposing our community to we know now this is a probable carcinogen it 's listed as that I think we can 't not take action and accept that it 's something that we need to work on to do really properly so it 's not something that falls out of our system in two years time or anything and I 'm happy that you don 't properly and over a period of two years and then get to happy it is support option to my preference is what counselor but is vouching three but I recognize the reality of getting support around the table to at this point I note even an option one it says it recognizes a potential risk to personnel and inside I think that 's important to take that on board as well over the costs there might be some short-term costs but actually you have to think long term over these things as well I have a suggested addition over the residential red zone a wire say that it is crown land but we have a red green zone interface there as residents say they still use those areas we have s it 's there by way of parks and I think it 's important that we write to Sarah informing them of our resolution today and ask them to review the use longer managed okay it 'll be lindsaym nuns lens yeah to review the loo the use of glyphosate I think it 's probably as far as we can go with it we write Toulon 's land information is out there the residents I 'm very concerned over this I 've taken yet another family funeral with someone 's died of cancer I think we have to take all steps that we can to prevent you know to prevent this so I hope that we could support for this today yeah and I think um you can 't informing them of its decision and ended and making stuff available to work with them as well you know that not just urging them to review the use of glass Kate but actually proactively offering our staff to work with them over the reduction in with liberals yeah so Andrew yani David thank you now I 'd like to UM foreshadow a further motion if I can that in the effect that option two is lost so noting the comments that have already been made by the deputy mayor and council livingstone if option two is lost I 'd like to move option three in that zone situation with the amendments that we 've made to option to incorporate it in the option three that I 'll move so in the event that indicating that counselors can dress has indicated that he we have its second that okay so um we 've heard a lot around the the use of glyphosate this morning we 've heard about the environmental and health and safety concerns and we 've obviously heard the debate around possible carcinogenic risk and um a lot of that 's not only undesirable but downright scary in fact we 've heard that people quite justifiably concerned about the effect on on plants other than the pest plants that are targeted by glyphosate use how people can 't_''_2627.46 be confident that fruits that they might normally choose to pick on on a walk might be fit to eat they may in fact actually be toxic people use leaves that they forage in salads or for medicinal purposes and we 've heard the you know some plants to some people are just weeds and deserve to be killed two other people those same plants have got either food value or medicinal value and those comments in a context that foraging for food in particular is becoming increasingly unpopular and increasingly something that people tenable option 2 is recommended but on balance on failing to see the value of option 2 over option 3 when balancing all the considerations and noting in particular that the result of today 's debate the decision we make today will be consulted on through the annual plan the public will make their views known i want to put out a realistic consideration so that we hear the views of the public on this and certainly we 've heard from informed members of the public today that there is a view in the community and obviously the annual plan consultation will tell us how widespread that view is and that glyphosate should in fact be be removed from the public realm altogether for that reason I won 't be supporting option 2 and I will be very pleased to move option 3 if option two is lost in my view continued use is unacceptable continued risk to workers and to the public is unacceptable and continued poisoning of public space is unacceptable so run on signaling clear support for option 3 option 2 and I are other members to wanted to check on the process so we 're unable to move option throughout this stage if we support option three we need two votes pushing against up function two and then vote for option option two is the one that 's been moved and second does you would it be helpful me in if I mean option three is kind of the ultimate although I take the point that joint actually a responsible bad self but yeah I haven 't echo spoken so it 's not fair to me when I was going to make was I was actually really interested in the option three with the ability for the team pre use like a public notice regime where there was you know on a case-by-case basis exemption f all lass had head failed so i don 't know how we can do that in terms of the consultation document but it seemed to me that because there 's so little difference between option two and three but actually option three when you talk about things like the waterways in the Whitman margins being at rest does seem sort with glass effect being put onto waterway margins and I know around where I love to see the use of it alongside the footpaths next to the rivers it actually looked worse than if people just want the grass actually mode they probably don 't care so much about the weeds and actually when they see the glass of fate being used to actually just makes it look it is so not not to mention the the risk of people children animals plane along cider so I can 't see any good reason to enable that to continue by supporting option to today so I wanted to just say that I don 't support option two I do support option three I do have something bethey for the pests that are in some of the regional parts around the quite invasive pests species that we have and looking to find alternative ways than glass fight in the medium to short term to address it so I didn 't want to completely rule it out but I personally think we should actually aim to be a healthy garden city and i deputations comes from little some who have a fantastic restaurant called roots which I think showcases what we could be in terms have been really unique about using our food locally sourced food and actually becoming celebrated for it as a city so I personally will not support option two I will support option three this is going up for consultation can I just say the other two points I want to make is that I think we need to put us the civic resolution making it clear of the expectation or in health and safety for our contractors and I think that needs to be recorded because i think it is totally unacceptable that we could have contractors not following health and safety boats to their workers but also to the public and i want us to have some level of protection by actually formalizing a resolution to that effect through this this process and the front of what our makers just that you know i think it 's interesting because we 're often told that the burden on the people when we deal with these complicated issues is a cautious approach to wait until the harm is proven I actually think we should take responsibility of taking a cautious approach that prevents harm to begin with rather than allowing this products to continually be used until such time as it 's proved that it 's hurtin harmed people I just you know that 's I think really at the heart of this debate around putting adequate resources into addressing the issue but from my point of view I don 't want to wait for people to be harmed by this I actually think the evidence as is pretty clear and I think we need to I congratulate those who towards running us forward to castle um it may be that that will have to do option three first then because what more I can see happening is that option 2 will fail and then option 3 will fail and we will have the status quo so I 'm very happy that was it with option 3 moved our option 2 and then it 's up closest was the movie second a little bit o Prince Remus well we of that one our motion in favor of that one being so option 3 becomes the substantive motion and then if that 's lost four years acid or option two so the meta me as a matter of process can I foreshadow the amendment which of option three with option to just so we didn 't have it on Joe look at options yeah yeah that means the same happy with okie and Glenn bring other movies and second deserve option three is please okay um and in option to change me that 's adoption to which I 'll second if it comes out just or just along here and they end in option one obviously the status quo because the limbs but does that complicate it okay poor I just add that first one but I 'm well no because if option three passes you won 't need it because we won 't be using very anywhere yes I mean time this is still going to roll it we 're not going to tomorrow to stop using classified it see straight away that 's what option 3 c 's was assuming that would be awaiting the outcome of the annual plan your horses oh I say okay right so so both ones should have requests staff to ensure that the provisions of OpenSocial crystals mistakes or the health and safety procedures are complied with by all contractors utilizing well actually utilizing any sprays but anyway um you yeah sure that that help health and safety regulations are complied with by all contractors by all staff and all contractors yeah yeah so um so I 've got David and then fell yeah I think he it looks like here 's another subject that I was probably going to be in the minority I was brought up in a rural environments and I 've had personal experience over a number of years with the application of a wide range of chemicals and herbicides some of which were significantly more toxic than than glyphosate AKA roundup oh I think it 's really important to note that the the dangers of these chemicals are really mitigated by the appropriate application processes and adequate health and safety standards need of the negative effects of suppose we can draw we are almost raw an analysis to asbestos long-term exposure heightens the risk I 've read the report and I note a few things that the ends at EPA consider glyphosate as a potential hazard and have declared it as safety use as a herbicide I also note that we there is a risk assessment being conducted by government authorities worldwide this year and personally I would find it more appropriate to wait for the findings of lease these bodies before we leap an off the deep end I 'm going to vote against options two three and four of a number of things and principally I think there are several alternatives to using glyphosate but none can really replace it exactly I think it 's also pertinent to note that that the alternative that our staff and others are proposed probably having to go to our fatty acid products were physical means 30 or said products actually pose a higher toxicity risk to the applicators than glyphosate that 's stated in the report as well I 'm also quite concerned about the cost of the fifty-yard million dollars over a 10-year period there will be an impact on our rates and I 'm sure there will be a number of people in the city that say why are we spending 50 million odd bucks over ten years on this product why should we should be spending that on earthquake recovery activities so in something i really say should we be authorizing extra expense when adequate health and safety practices precautionary and pragmatic approaches to the use of glyphosate he round up would be far more appropriate than going down this track so I will be voting against anything bar option one and Phil and I 'd like to put the case 24 but to go back to option two I think some strong reasons for that I want to start though by saying I cannot agree with minimizing the risk of glass afaik to minimize it given the evidence we 've got is entirely unacceptable and we 've got the the World Health Organization we 're ghosts have got the international agency for research on cancer saying that it is it is probably can 't_''_3364.299 're having this debate i 'm very pleased the staff are taking issue seriously but i think the staff recommendation is actually the correct one what I think we will have to keep in mind is that as the report from the staff who are in fact in their regional parks they some of their native species would be at risk every if we just use manual methods and I think that 's really important for the good of our whole city and and as directed see there 's no silver bullet around us it does not mean we cannot take further steps when we when we obtain better methods in the future so look I 'm strongly some think it 's essential we respond to the health and safety risk and I think that option 2 allows that so I 'm supporting it optional Paul just prefer come I got a fully endorse what counselor Clearwater said I hear the concerns of the community around the youths and the public 's places and so forth but I mhe also equally concern about destroying a natural habitat I 've seen areas of our of our natural bush any areas of our parks that to me that 's as almost as greater concern so I would would be supporting the option to until we actually receive the outcome of the investigations that have been carried out worldwide and until then I think this will be the most sensible outcome for us today to be fair Jenny yeah I look I 've I 've full shadowed option 3 with option two one for a matter of process because we want to ensure that we get it call all these things but I actually think it 's the right one would I be happy for my my new bride to be standing down when from someone administering roundup and no no I wouldn 't_:_3480.0 NM sheets you were pregnant driver I had kids no I wouldn 't want them anywhere near it that 's a personal call but I think we need to make we need to make realistic compromise all the time council decision making is always a balancing act there are pros and cons with everything there are very real financial quite real cases where what we need to do as far as maintenance of our environment will will be compromised by just going out on all-out offensive and doing a blanket ban so I think that a pragmatic and prudent way forward is option 2 it aligns with the staff thinking and it ensures that when practical practicable there won 't be the use of roundup and these carcinogens and when there 's no other option its away from people vnr as a worst-case last resort then then they may be used the other the other effective matter is to we 're going to be consulting on this and nothing 's closed off we 'll be hearing hearing from a range of people in the community what their thoughts are on and where they 're very appetite for risk and really align in the Sanders as well so i 'll have my ears open as we go through the sun and your plan process and my strong preference is to align with the staffs view that the pragmatic middle ground approach of option two is the best way forward so and support an option to all right um oh look I 'm fearing that we 're losing the community board chairs so I 'd like to put the motion if I can so um can you set it up for a vote the vote system is not working with your hands they were all smoking you 're gonna hold us

imprisoned I think I came but you are considered officers so that means that you need to be satisfied that organization has the appropriate systems in place to prevent injury manage health and safety and it also reflects on your decisions so raising issues to make sure that the decision in stone and cactus health and safety well um but there are happy to provide through the workshops there have been some workshops to provide support around it okay thank you thank you there 's a long discussion on this audit and risk yeah yeah yeah yeah okay oh just all that health so if we had advice yes though it as an officer if we are uncomfortable with you 're not sure we should get down and they can go and look for ourselves seem to blur the line between governance and management so there is some issues we need to move through on the whole health or safety year legislation that 's great so I think it is about being confident that the right systems are in place and that we 're addressing issues and if it means that you knew your concern and do need to go and see how something works then I think it 's just part of your understanding do you remember that with health and safety and anything like this is a question sorry that 's all right is this a question or II don 'ti likely yes okay I 'll reach a free conveyed the mirrors with health and safety if you 've got a relevant where you are if you 've got experts in those field giving you advice because none us our experts and everything all those yeah um that would be the advice that you would follow and put into any health and safety process that you do is that correct or 're getting up i don 't expect you this was a long discussion at ordered and rest get the last word because you like guys like another proofing on health and safety I 've had so many of years of what I don 't think I like we 're not giving the traction it 's probably timely given that the new legalization comes in April and that we did have an order until readiness and we 've been working on some of the issues here to improve education training and so they 're having one counter i think is now just being taken to court over a death with a contractor over a rubbish truck going up a hill so i mean i think we do need to actually this contractors actively when we need to really need to consider it 's not our liabilities are ya nearest ways in terms of working with our contract there 's any expectations so I person would welcome a wish okay thank you um question is it Henry yesterday yeah um and it released the acura wastewater treatment plants under capital expenditure age as one of the capital project which is delayed now I 'm aware that we 're working through some design issues as a result of the failure to consent the outfall so we 're working with through some issues with night out who and local Runanga those discussions are going well its various I I wasn 't aware that that had caused a delay to this project I thought that we were still on target to develop project within forecast timelines even with the outcome of the hearing and the additional work that we were doing so what this relates to is where the budget was phased in in the expenditure event so what a large piece of work around the capital expenditure as you know has been about when we expect to spend the money as opposed to the heroic assumptions about so this is about timing of the payment rather than timing of the project so just to confirm there is no delay to that project it 's just the payment which is going to be made later than we originally anticipated so just keep quick Dave but because what we use is default is Kerry for budget on a project now that 's only one element of a project there is time of the project there 's the budget and some of that carry forward as as Colleen said as are related to where we 've faced the expenditure around their project so we face it earlier than what we 've spent it so that will add into the caring for but the project is still on track to meet our resorts considering requirements and our consultation projects and things I before we were hoping we would be spending money earlier than what we have though okay thank you any other questions is it a question yeah yeah yeah just um it 's related to the support around the cycleway program but also the previous report what you went through very quickly and that was just in relation to the discussion is there any discussion happening with indeed ta about providing off-road cycleways on the roads that they are doing like the Western Bypass the dyers road which they are widening and maybe others I know when funding the cycleway so I just wanted to get a sense of if we 've made the request and what the response has been or if we haven 't made the request how can we make the request I don 't I can find out whether we 've made or whether they built any of that into the design i don 't actually specifically know on that i do know that they on other projects they are committed you will have seen that purple thing that went up an auckland that was indeed ta around their motorway network so they are putting in cycle waves as part of some of those projects but we 'll find out whether we 're specifically done that will you just get back to cancel because it 's quite an important issue yeah okay okay don 't be good no more questions one other question was just around the at the years in the forecast in terms of the capital expenditure an earthquake we build what 's the total projected carry forward haven 't_''_407.31 we are thinking it could be I think it 's one think was the last figure that i have carried forward and that has been been built into the program going on in to the annual plan it will be an addition of that just you 've got our quarter half year result on that at this point in time obviously area that i wasn 't quite clear on was in particular the earthquake rebuild the 285 million it was carried forward and then you might reconsider 130 of skirts all has worked through the early uncertainty of funding under the cost share agreement so can someone just explain what that what that means what happened is there 's three funders into the cost year agreement to make up that 2.93 billion and so basically ourselves Sarah and NZT a slightly more comic overseas but a bit of dia money in there but basically there was a time that Sarah was hitting closer to be a limit of what the appropriation was so they wouldn 't approve some of those projects so while they sorted that out and that 's part of the funding of renewals and that program some of going through the gateways it 's now all gone through it well no it 's not almost all gone through the gateways and the stuff that 's left is the esso but when I say it 's gone through the gateways a good example would be the northern relief which is suica then it 's concert the Gaelic it 's a six-month design and procurement process before they start constructing on the ground though because I have to design then I 've got to buy the specialized bike and things like that so as soon as it 's given to ski it doesn 't mean they could start spending that money to and so that delay kind of feed some onwards okay thank you is that did you want to move something I thought I just had a resolution that i justjust emails right um you put it up guys there 's a super 12 mr. notice you won 't just tell us what it is while they 're doing it oh yeah I 'll just bring it up so basically it 's the essence of it is just to sympathy and thoughts to the people of Fiji at the impact of cyclone Winston I just request that the chief executive extend the support of the city to a disaster response and recovery efforts and I just think it 's really important that we acknowledge what 's happened I know that we will have things under way that I 'd like the chief easier haps just to give a quick response around there but i do think to recognize you know how generous other countries and other communities were to ask for our time of need I think it 's really important that we do place on record that we stand alongside the people of Fiji as they deal with what is a really tragic and devastating event and we make sure that we do what we can do to provide the support that mean that as possible thanks Johnny is there a signal for their sake yeah signature me and I 'll just get going to respond I you thank you for that and we do express our simply so councils working with the Red Cross and the Indian from Christchurch so we 've got fundraising boxes will be put up in libraries and see the senior centers and we 're promoting that through a website in social media that a container is being filled with required good so they 've asked for water blankets in some

for the past 10 years the pool group and the swim club have worked very closely together to achieve a vision to replace the outdoor pool of each we 're in February 85 years ago the swim club and a group of San orbán 's residents met the council and I think it was on a febri day thursday in February 85 years ago met the council to share their vision of a community pool on council land up 43 it a edgware road but me the outcome was of the council gifted the land to the community for the purpose of a swimming pool the community then raised the funds and built the pool and this absorbed achieved during the years of the Great Depression over the next 70 years the pool was successfully run by it 's an Auburn swim club and with a number of groups and organizations in the community and some of the representatives are here today thanks becoming who share our vision of a new pool at edgware firstly that 's an urban swim club and its team of volunteers is very active since the demolition of the Edgware poor the club relocated to Shirley Intermediate School and for the past eight years they 've continued to provide blue into swimming classes for over 60 children each season another group supporting is as the injury of business group they 're very supportive and the CNU pool as an asset to the community and obviously to business the suburban school also supports the vision in the past five years their role is increased to 600 children and it 's climbing their current building program that they 're going through right now doesn 't include a new pool the principal ism the principal of the school has indicated that their pool is only suitable for juniors and we have a memorandum of understanding with the school that the senior school will use the Edgware pool probably on a daily basis another residents association and the community as a whole also share the vision this was shown in the results of accounts of working party which indicated that ninety-nine percent of respondents supported a community pool on the same site in edgware a new community pool has been given top priority also in the sand or Bin 's community strategy this was a Twiggy point plan revitalize greatest in Auburn 's over the next decade we 're here today is to ask the land of 43 a edgware road as again made available to the community so the community can again raise the funds to

meetings head keeps these minutes beautifully hand written and or every detail recorded even to the flavor of the scones that were long meetings but there 's a very valuable document and I just like to congratulate Valerie for actually taking the immense amount of time in the trolling through the library records as well to verify all the facts that we 've done there and to put that document together there wasn 't a question and also I just would like to ask it are you tired after ten years it 's been ongoing and like the council we would like I see a conclusion cool well shall we after Antony was just yeah we just go straight on 280 26 so you don 't have to sit through the entire council meeting why did the team uses sorry we 've gone to you I 'm sorry shall we just do item 26 first which is your item rather than funding we would appreciate that okay I thank you guys you can fit we 're there that 's right now thank you very much indeed for everything actually just for hanging in there as well um item 26 poor name do you want to do we need you stud well I don 't think we will need them Pauling George 's yes ah holy would you like to move it that 's it oh oh I think I 'll need to move it yeah yeah so if you move it who seconds does it is it just a normal what 's the process here we go so far is it oh that 's a weak immune time don 't be a little proposal see ya Mr McKay so sir the council is limited so calling you can move it according to Ian am i right yes and Timothy can 't okay but you wanted to amend it slightly Pauline yeah I 'd like to suggest an amendment to and I don 't think that five years time frame for a project like this although the group have bought a considerable hearing now so they 've funded the whole process up till now and they held off until they could have security over the land both in the project underway in the funding so I personally would sink a 10 year time frame would be more or less still Anton 's happy to see can bet mr. Henry that we 've talked about case managers being brought in with special projects to assist those groups etc so I 'd really like with your permission fall into a dead end that the council 's fire case manager to assist through the consensus citroen of this these guys have been waiting I should never happen but you know we 're here we 're here now this market as positive as possible well I think there 's a lot of ways that council could support this without checking and money so I fully support that term okay is there any problem with it no so the case managers are often for large or multiple realized it given that this has been a complex process ok so it 's open for debate and the amendment be replaced with ten years just by process comment on that what we 've done is changed the five years in the original resolution to 10 what we need to do is change 10 back to five and then where it 's got by replacing the value with one dollar we then need to have by replacing the time with tenseiga Thea Kashiwa head of the lawyer house people oh is it exactly a comment um I didn 't quite pick up that what what so we 're actually and we 've just by replacing the value with one dollar and adjusting the time frame to ten years is what we 're actually doing yep yep okay good okay so that 's what Pauline is moving and timber seconding any further discussion I mean Danny thank you just to say I fully support this I think many of us aware of the colorful history of this pool in the city in those colors not always bright but this is a chance to make a new start and I think it might you know for the San Albans community in particular 's happened in the past so all power to them and hope you give it a good vote today and get it underway well Kenny oh yeah um yeah I strongly support taking this course of action I think when you just reflect on the lack of aquatic facilities within the central city and this is actually quite close to the central city and also the fact that there 's a real need for people to be able to develop their own communities particular areas where you 've seen huge intensification of housing so I 've no doubt that a facility at this location will be well used given us proud tradition and history but also given its future prospects in terms of increased housing and it will see both from the central city and in the wider gladys st. Albans area so I think this is the right thing to do I do want to acknowledge the community and the struggle and the stress that they 've been put through and you know just to say thank you to them for endeavouring to keep going with this project and council can offer our support um I 've been involved with community pool since my children and the difference between graham condom center which is a pull and you see in the report that the council had a pool plan they 're missing the emotion of what a community pool really owes your kids been other kids your share fish and chips with other families that 's what a true community is and you bump into them at supermarkets you see the other kids on the street you know who they are and to have this back after this long time I 'm just so pleased that we 've got to the stage I want to assure you this council is totally understanding of what our communicable truly is so thank you for your rum steadfast a pursuit in this and I was informed that last time you came here the council provided security for you so sorry we didn 't do it this time but I maybe you know how you livin ohhh okay but thank you so much for the work you 've done cheers okay ok let supportive of this today I mean certainly just echoing what Tim has said a community pool is far more than just a place to go and swim it 's um it 's somewhere to relax it somewhere for recreation and fitness but it 's a community bumping space and it actually becomes part of what brings and keeps a community together and I think what we 're doing today is giving an opportunity for a good ending to what has been a very long story with some less than perfect chapters in it so I 'm hoping the decision we make today is an opportunity for a really good ending to the story and one thing I don 't doubt is that there will be a really strong sense of community ownership of this facility once it 's been completed and I 'd just like to commend the community group and the people that have been involved with this for very many years not only for being part of the ability for us to pass this proposal today but just for their commitment and determination to this project and I only thing I want to add a pop of endorsing what everybody 's just hit as the fact that I 'm really pleased to see as a ten year time frame because a fully Resource Council it takes at least five years to issue get a pool give a charity you guys friends even show us up on here see how it can be done a lot faster Pauline I 'm good net you close the debate thank you very much you that 's a great day actually and it 's very emotional one and look I 'm Ali 's being held up she 's flying back from work and she really really wanted to beat me for this she 's very supportive as well and has been from the start so it 's not to be yelling but um she 's here in spirit I 'd also like to thank the community board the shitty papineau community board have been very supportive after the u.s. quakes and 2011 the boards began community conversations to strengthen the community to find out the courses so much damage especially rancid all ones wanted what what would help them get through this crisis and what will actually support us all in the future and out of our document there was massive support for the Paul to come back again because that view was a heart of each we 're so the community all has been incredibly supportive as well i have to mention mr. coffee who has departed from us now and he was a passionate about Paul 's he supported the group was a little bit of funding in the early days not always easy to it was but a real character and really really passionate about swimming and he told us repeatedly how many swimming pools outdoor pools they were in christchurch when he was a young lead and in how important they are to communities and i agree with what Tim 's saying i like to think about the HP of paul as it was a park with a pool minute so a different experience d council pools the council pulls the more for training education etc you go there have a swim and then you come away but an spend the whole day there and wander down to the shops and in spend a bit of money in the community as well and the other thing I 'd like to say is once again thanking Valerie and Paul for holding that swim club together when they lost the pool they didn 't give up they went and found another one they supported shuli intermediate to get their pool fixed which took a couple of years after the earthquakes they 're running an incredibly successful program not just teaching children but involving the parents who come along and put in some volunteer time they have barbecues down there they 're also teaching coaching so in lifeguard skills so this is an incredibly incredibly important program that these two people and their members and given as well as the president you have been holding on to this club for years and I think it 's remarkable what they 've done the tenacity the vision that they have is to be incredibly commended for ten years of the special and today is an incredibly important day for the door community linseed there new beginning and I just can 't_''_989.01 say enough about the work that 's going on here and look forward to well it 's the next battle I suppose you won 't look at it as a better or look at Edison opportunity and I hope that the council here can walk alongside you which is our new co Papa will walk alongside in support weekend i 'll put that motion those in favor please say aye all right I supposed it was carried unanimously you can go _"

    "text": "right I 'm going to revert to the normal agenda now and go to item number six and I think Andrew yours here from the report from the beer would pick this community board about another swimming pool in schools ah shut since terminals that we need okay well do you just want to tell us the community boards view on that yep Andrew Andrea okay thank you very much so yes hear about the sale of land to the Ministry of Education now this conversation probably started upwards of two years ago The Keg was formed the qe2 k or the QT replacement keg was formed and the purpose of that was to define what we wanted in a piece of land anywhere in the East hurt to rebuild our pool and so the first thing we did was come up with a number of criteria and I 've asked for them to be provided but they haven 't obviously come but they they included accessibility room to grow geotechnical information you know hazards transportation that there was a about a dozen criteria that we defined and we spent which of those were the most important to us in which were the least important and we then used that extensively throughout the process to determine which burger parcel of land we wanted we looked at number of sites all around the east obviously qe2 was chosen the 15 months ago for a memory based on on those criteria and so then within the park I think we 've also really sort of fallen back on those Curran those criteria to work out where in the Parkers the best place for the pool to be re-positioned and even before we 'd even heard whispers about the schools looking at the site we had already picked in broad terms the area that the pool was marked on the map on this earth thank you so then the skulls obviously came into the mix and we have met with the school 's a number of times and formal settings also when this as she was coming to be decided we we felt as a board as though we needed a little bit more conversation with the school 's to really understand their school 's about three weeks ago now and had a really good conversation within because obviously we have to n our decision we have to look at what they 're wanting as well for their facilities and so so we had a really good prank open discussion and the accumulation I think of all of those two years of many many many many many meetings and being provided with all the information that we 've asked for around you know we 've had really detailed information on geo technical information that kind of thing the board have unanimously decided that that has the best placement for the the three facilities to give them all the the best that we can do to allow the site to be the most awesome it can be it 's been unanimous from the community was unanimous from the candidate with his cute is there a time behind you now um yeah just if there 's anything I got that list don 't worry so I probably talk to it so is there anything you want to tell us Simon um probably the the first of the Polar 's and we went through Andrea squadron DC we went through a very extensive process we looked at firstly the geotechnical quality of the land was really really important when we looked at all the sites right throughout the whole the East most Padilla technical information was pretty much the same and so it almost became a null point and some respects that we knew that we would have to do work on all pieces of leaned it was it was shades of us after yeah they were but the real key thing really was around the exes the other real key thing the community would wanted was room to grow the previous qe2 was in the center of the park and controlled the park and obviously there was an S bit around the buildings and we have decided that that would be a better option to be put to the new eastern Rican sports center in that location so they had room to grow to the north also to the east and to the west as well and also hopefully dovetail into what the Ministry of land to the south as well to create a community hub okay thank you what I 'll do if it 's okay with you guys now is just let anyone ask any questions that they 've got of tamil salmon or andrea yeah well the questions was asked this morning is about our exes but technically there are 3 x 's sides in to be this ugly because you 've got barriers and you 've got the road that goes down on an angle to a Scott here so it was actually really good access onto the solace not all from the the the the front is and the old if you want main entrance and a curie to and generally the local community would be using those other two roads to avoid the truth were moving to correct them well well the the proposal doesn 't go into those levels of detail unless thing but we have seen sort of a bit more we have here discussion around that obviously traffic management a big consideration when you 've got you know a lot of people going to be on option of different alternate entry and egress entry and exit points and so there is still work to be done at those points of entry any except eight years that I believe there is um yeah I probably can get a little more detail we 've been working the ministry education around a traffic plan for the site right sorry we 've been working with Ministry of Education around the traffic plan for the site with your traffic engineers they believe the best access is off travis road to be able to give the flow through particularly from a bus point of view of getting a through route for a bus to make sure that there is accessibility to these two regions sportscenter the secondary axis is of power Rev which will also be a service access to the back of the building we have deliberately not taken an axis from the north from Escott and that is primarily we thought there may be a little bit more difficult for reasons to try and reduce the amount of traffic that the resonance would have to put up with if there to put that out in the future should the need arise and this suit me is the ability to do that but at this stage we believe the Travis and the bauer excesses will be able to cater to the park thank you alright it 's arman questions at the moment and yanni ninja me thank you um obviously trees have been a pretty big issue in the local community at the moment when I look at what we 're proposing legal consultation worth that would look like most the trees on the side mature trees are going so just can you just kind of help us understand what considerations been given to the location in regards to the loss of trees in the public realm so the the verities around the older qe2 entrance there were a number of memorial trees we 've identified what those trees are in line of oaks for example is an area that we have had consultation with the ministry around we have an the ministry have agreed with us their trees are of primarily importance to the site and they will try and if there needs to be a reduction of trees in with replanting to make sure that that will occur they took you around the axis ways we are being really careful around how we how we just minimize any disruption to trees at all the reality is it 's a big site if there 's a lot of trees on the site a lot of mature trees and we wish to keep as many as we can write this goes out for consultation it shows the eastern equality those those trees of the arrow eucalyptus trees on there right through that area and actually believe that they can be replaced somewhere else not the trees themselves but would be able to do replanting because I was um in terms of the different options why why are we not going out with an option that maybe they single man so that 's how I think leasing the land rather than selling it and and just wondered whether we had any of other options as well around the location because particular where the school is located obviously that 's the the front we thought about having an option about leasing but also the entrance to carry to which is basically dominated by the school yeah so i can probably ask that we we 've been through a huge number of iterations of plan locations for the ministry on the site putting them out the back towards Escott air putting around the side bar air putting them on the western part of the site and the Ministry of a number of similar to us they have a number of criteria for location for schools proximity invisibility and prominence and from safety point of view they 're very keen for visibility of Travis road the board and the community also expressed a desire to have that as well which is why we have this org is the access road going around but we have a big green space there so the visibility you can see the eastern Rick and sport Cena from Travis road as I said before we 're looking at trying to put the facility in the center of the scene of the pack so that it has that room to grow have indicated very strongly that is the preference for location thank you and you got another questions are out and the other question they also expressed it interest to purchase the land rather than lease the land our preference was to sell foreland in terms of location in terms location we really happy with the location that the board again have have seen a number of these iterations we 've had many hours of going through how we could do it differently and the board and consultation with a number of community groups I mean obviously it 's not probably unanimous it makes the whole community you 'd probably never get that but but for the most part the key people that we 've spoken to are comfortable with the pool being in the center of the park and it creates the hub because you go you 're not going only just going to have the schools and things to the south but you 're going to have sports fields and other facilities to the north so created it makes it that sort of the center of the spoke port you know street it 's going to be a pool but it 's going to be 360 degrees of sports around it as well Thank You Jimmy okay thank you one question it 's on the order at the one teaching of Buddha said before the option of here mention council work develop a new sport and recreation facility QE to pack and also in particular measure is a partnership with the m.o.e I just want to know this the new facility you know we will commence the how about those two school closed the event Cypress school and the sherry boys hi they still after their own the school sporting recreation facility or they just sheer with the council the community facility so the ministry has a certain requirement to provide a level of service for schools as part of the rebuilt and that includes sport and recreation facilities such as the courts such as the sports field so they 've minimum levels that they have to provide in discussions with the ministry we have indicators them said look as the opportunities for us to share the facility both to utilize and they are more than open to heaven conversation with us and that 's primarily one of the key drivers behind us is to try and create a real community partnership between the schools the eastern rican sports center and the wider Sporting Park and informal regression Ares about in our relationship is kind of having soup whether the mo you should consider contribute a part of the funding regarding to least a new facility so the the ministry is spending a significant amount of money on the redevelopment of the two schools part of that obviously is around the courts and auditoriums and in facilities which could be utilized by the community and so I think the controlling to a lot back into the east and certainly applaud them for that okay thank you thank you clean thank you just in our informal prior to the meeting I sensed that as sometimes happens with major issues and wards there can sometimes be a contextual kind of disconnect you know when the ward councillors are immersed in a process and then with the whole council considers something so the line of sight over is to reckon sport in relation to the schools and whether you could convey to us Simon what you anticipate through the design for the community so obviously they 'll want to see their pride and joy from the road and we 've got the schools in the front yes so the if you look at the the plan you 'll see quite clearly as you come from the west and you 're coming through you 'll have quite a good visible line of sight through decent Rican sportscenter similar to QE to where i was on the center of the park and again it was probably hidden by a number of trees of the western side and also the eastern side I think you 'll very clearly be able to see across the school sporting fields and be able to see the pool Paul 's our destination as well and once you know where it is you know you feel as soon as you get to the entrance you feel you there anyway so we certainly don 't see it as an impediment okay have a mover and a seconder maybe a gleam and david d reckon for this rick in a recommendation ok move clean signal did david and is there any debate would you like to speak to David yeah like to speak to the to the motion clearly this is a resolution that proposes consultation hearings and maybe some adjustments to the proposal before we actually sell the land to the ministry I see it as just another important milestone and the recovery of the east and the development of two high schools in conjunction with a eastern suburbs sport and recreation facility will be quite a milestone in their recovery one of the things that I think is not overly seen at the moment is that the location of the pool and the location of the school 's recreational facilities give us the opportunity to create quite a community hub of sporting activities the school have indicated that they are more than amenable for their gymnasiums their proposed Performing Arts Center to be used outside of school hours for our community we 're also looking at the possibility of the of its foreign recreation facility as well so the other thing I think is cognizant is the the facility where it is is our facility is built for expansion so we need to have it in that central location allowing room around the facility to expand as and when required there have been some concerns expressed today about trees in the in the footprint of the park and their recovery and there 's some very historical group of trees close to the entrance that will need some considerable consideration and in the final patch of land that actually gives sold to the to the ministry I think just finally look I 'm extremely supportive of this this move that is leading to a significant development in our area we are looking at a redevelopment of the hospital near nearing completion this facility with the schools and the sports facility legacy projects and work in New Brighton and they all collectively I think will give a huge and boost to New Brighton and the eastern suburbs we have four years sort of labored with a hat or best say this a eastern suburbs that 's never been seen with great favor or flavor from successive councils and I think these moves and a number of others may help to promote the eastern suburbs as a vibrant and exciting place to develop which hasn 't been in this area for some years so look I 'm very supportive of the step and the process to get a number of projects actually off the ground and up and running in the East where our residents out they are actually itching to see something actually heaven and this is a great step in the direction of achieving their thank you thank you Danny hey yeah um thank you um I certainly don 't want to hold up the process or the progress on Eastern sports and in the schools but my main concern is that when you look at this report you 're not given the context or the options around what what might be other solutions to some of the issues that may be raised in consultation so my concern is that if you just look at the Met people might go we koala facilities down the back in a way and it 's got worse access than the old qe2 site no no things have changed but I mean I will vote for those because it is important to get out for consultation but I do hope it in the information sessions that the staff can actually prepare some of those other considerations that may be around you know for example how long does it take to walk from the main entrance to the aquatic facility what 's going to happen to the trees because when you just look at this diagram probably doesn 't quite do it justice as to what 's being proposed and the recipes if you get an overwhelming response against ER you actually haven 't made any progress at all you go back to square one and I think that would be a real shame so that 's my desire to see further information actually further options around what what is happening I just remind counselors that there have been some historical agreements with Ministry of Education aurora center at been so for example may have been a community that access to that building and it 's quite expensive so often these things sound great at the start but over time they can change and actually the community can end up not having the expectations that they thought they would have been fulfilled so I think it 's really important that this gets clarified at the start and so as follows consultation I hope you 'll be able to provide the information around what some of those arrangements and conditions are because I think it 's important that people know what the trade-offs are that are being attached but as I said I just think it 's really important that the wider context is made clear around things like that access the environment and some of the community benefits so that when it goes out for consultation there is an opportunity for people to understand how you come to the conclusions that you 've come to and actually make informed submissions so I will support it because I want to see it go forward but I am concerned about something so much you do now is attached 'm supportive of this and I I 'm supportive of the work that the community board in the to ward councillors have obviously put on to this hours and hours and hours so I 'm fishy comfortable was their guidance on this and you 're recommending that you can 't afford the site this teacher and it is just going out for consultation so more may be revealed in due course I just quantitate the opportunity to remind counsel of the notice of motion I lodged at the last meeting about the trees I 'm not sure we that 's landed but I think we were generally unanimously supportive that of the principle of entry is removed it will be replaced the numbers so I 'm just reminding you of that and I 'm sure that 's the case because you didn 't actually ask well well aware thank you honey you wanted that yeah thank you just holding my glass half full I do take on board counsel yo Hansen 's questions and you know he has a right to ask them and I 'm I hope that they a unique hub for the east of recreational and sporting facilities and I 'm not sure how often any of us ever get an opportunity like this to be part of that obviously the question over prominence of the Easter reckon support facility will be in the communities mind we 'll hear about that through the hearings panel process we will probably hear a bit about what will happen to the proceeds from the sale as well given the backdrop of all of the insurance and they 're going to the Metro sports facility but this is about a consultation process now that this item is about sitting dead often training leading the community had their say and I 'm sure they will they 've got very strong views and we will hear you know the themes will come through pretty strongly and we 'll know what they 're thinking so did it begin okay so i 'll put the recommendation those in favor please say aye all right nice post carriage thank you guys thank you veneer it guys ok i sent number seven smoke-free can 't breathe _"

    "text": "sorry so in removes yep so this is a part yeah happy to move this is a parte from shed it 's a voluntary trial for a limited time its smoke-free Canterbury 's projects are they 're doing the work on this it 's aligned with the smoke-free 2025 project which we 've already spoken about in the past it 's essentially around ways the council can support smoke-free Canterbury in running this project and I stress it is a voluntary project for a limited time thank you very much you can did by Jamie put those in favor please say aye aye opposed carried the chip item number 8 depositions by appointment with the workshop on the TPP I Harris TPP and dude you want to speak on that yeah i mean this came out of our shed meeting a deputation to our chad meeting where we had a large number of people in the public gallery and there was a very interesting discussion around the committee table as a result of the deputation that we heard the feeling of the committing was that before we were in a or to make a substantive decision about what council might like to do and there was a need for education and if we were going to be bringing experts in to run workshops for counselors around this then it will be good to have those workshop public since then there 's been some discussion about exactly what format this might take and I think the feeling is that a public workshop for counselors but with the opportunity to live stream that and have the public answer questions in the context of it would be a good way forward obviously getting the right the public asked questions sorry yeah so that that 's likely to be the way forward but the cotton thrust of this from the committee discussion really is that all we can make a decision what we might like to do about the TPP then we need some education we need that workshop before we can arrive at that decision so that 's what this partay resolutions about today thank you and andrew is moving that and yannis second in it you can ask please yeah I just the other shade stuff that was discussed this but this is the only report this is a part I but the other resolutions that the committee 's done right the minute in the minutes kind of recorded in Eureka is that kind of going to the next meeting cuz they were ready in time oh ok cool hit them in a couple of weeks all right but can we just focus on this one for the moment you 'll see continued at uni yeah absolutely second oh yeah sure um Paul Andrews said I do agree with her I would prefer it to workshops one for counselors but a second for the public which counselors could attend with a professional facilitator because it must be a lot of the public that want to ask questions and get into some digit lock ourselves and I 'm just concerned that if you have a workshop with counselors I will get absorbed into the council how there to fix the council which is totally appropriate but there are many questions that the public and many angles that individuals and our city we want access to them in a public forum so I would prefer to have her to which was what we were looking at was how it actually affected local government because obviously that 's really important there is also an infant workshop being held on the 11th much I think in a rush which they 're doing a series of visits but I think rather than sort out the detail of it here how about you Andrew Glenn and term work out how we do this with in conjunction with staff very good okay but yep okay I don 't think we need to pass it as recently she wanted what happen just a discussion i 'm just-just strongly support this just to highlight that there was actually a public meeting in the terms of similar cathedral not not too long ago so but i just wanted to pick up on the point i think the really important thing for us as a city is to understand the consequences on us and that will hopefully inform any future resolution that we put forward as much as helping people o 'cl people context but i do agree that we should be focused on what is the impact on a city in light of the request to consider declaring ourselves TPP great also so would we be inviting representatives of the government to actually put the governess and what we 're going to do was get experts in the subject matter and and so those are yet to be determined and one of the suggestions was that we use the new dean of the law school at canterbury university but there is some papers that are out now from Jane Kelsey from Richard Northey but my question really was you 're getting academia and others forgive opinion are we are we going to let the government of the day ever chance to explain their position others well I 'm sure that in fact will be part of that they 're definitely part of the workshop but what we 're looking at is not really people 's opinion it 's what happens if for example we decide that we don 't want to use roundup and Monsanto issues a nice tears and investor state government are we in any way liable for that do we are we in any way limiting our sovereignty as a city and it was just getting the facts actually rather than a lot of emotion and about it so as a community are we in any way limited in the way in which we do smoke free or anything because of it vector stuff you know I 'm really supportive of this i think you know it 's a six thousand page agreement and i don 't think anyone really in a layer capacity police people you understand the ramifications on this year and it 's a full proper legal counsel on issue what it does mean species it 's become such a contentious issue for the community right across the country so i think not only for christchurch is this an issue for the whole museum and they all need to understand what it means and i think this is a great way of doing so this is just a mechanism for us to do so okay thank you and with it we 've got some important items some applications procurement for us so you know really is important that we look into it deeply that there 's something incredibly democratic about having it here at the seat of local democracy to i mean i take down his point about the discussion of the transitional cathedral but i think for the council to be seen to have this here fabulous and just the sort of thing we want to promote okay okay all good so it 's moved andrew second to Janet I 'll put that those in favor please say aye those opposed carried and Andrew timidly going to sort it cool I cranford Street upgrades cross-section mechanic sorry we 've done the one that you 're most passionate about sorry about that but they were

gets built and as a result of that we have to indicate them what that preferred design solution is if we 'd ever guess bill now um well it 's still if it ever gets built them and still subject to the annual plan price that 's right that 's not very important to wear these not committing those two to anything in the LTP processes it 's got a very strong caveat on it and as part of this procurement process which we 're doing in tandem and then ZTA we can pull out of that process in june of this year we are important serving aware of that okay so can I alien important I just wanted to ask on page 51 four point three point two there is mention about safety and the thing that seems to suggest that higher safety requirements or something that makes the cycleways safer doesn 't really need to be applied to those who are confident cyclists so I 'm getting it through the report so for example it says there that risk averse cyclists will not use cranford street and instead use this physically separated but isn 't the issue it 's not the cyclist that 's the issue or might be part of it it 's actually the distance from the vehicle the speed of the vehicles you note that the cyclists using cranford will be traveling at pace its speed because they are the minute you know and you talk about hitting pedestrians when you travel at speed on a bike could be dangerous and cause injury you 've done the foot back there on the form my question is I 'm confused as to how you 're arguing if you like for safety in saying that it 's safer if you 're you are if a car takes you out the cars gonna work well yeah I mean I think that there has to be a recognition of the fact that when we design this these cross sections we were we were forced to because of the the process their designation pasa tried to fit everything in when they exist in rail corridor and it 's a case of how you out like allocate the space within that so we looked at a few situations there is two to basically to try and work out the best way of accommodating cyclists pedestrians and motorists who would use the route and what we tried to do was recognized the fact that 's because of the fact we 're building the papper new apparel nearby and that will be a very attractive root for the father would be these more of a cyclist you 're going to call them that and only the more confident ones would would remain on cranford street like allows if you want to call mal channel so effectively it 's reckoned by sea we would be concerned about the at all that those people would be imperiled still because it would be sharing a lane with with traffic or something like this trick question is why is the differentiation around whether it 's separated seems to be pinned on the confidence and ability of the cyclist when I 'm suggesting to you an interest in your response that that 's actually not entirely correct because it 's the vehicle that how close you are to a vehicle to speed at which the cyclist is traveling in the vehicle is traveling surely is a far more important considerable well that 's correct yeah i think that the my responses that would be that by providing a delineated cycle in which is which is separated albeit just by a white line one gives a message to motorists to stay away from the cyclist to either way to degree that 's the reason why we did in other parts of the city and and it 's given that message to the motorist as well better sense don 't you know stay away from cycles in this area this is it dead so it was a bad solution I mean to you know we had to make compromises in this and it and it goes back as far as the designation process where we had to understand that if we wanted to designate a wider corridor through there we 'd have to make a you know a very good argument as to why we needed to take people and off from living rooms off of them and we simply wouldn 't be able to do that yeah well ed it would have been but then the point is anybody who was objected to that any traffic engineer who was acting for a resident assault will be able to point to other or the roads around the city in that point particular occur latrobe which NZTA built were they have fit those Rodian requirements in the 20 point 1 meter wide road in corridor and that 's actually the problem so if we 'd gone seeking that designation in the n.o our process we would have lost it I don 't think one of the other issues is if it has been designed to that 's been adopted here it 's not actually just something that 's come out of the designer and in both cases in terms of the traffic lane width and the sarcolemma weeds which we meet the minimum requirements in case of traffic lane words when marginally above that well no the traffic lanes marginally wider than the absolute minimum the cycle ends ago many mamas right okay so you can see and Pauline suggested amendment well you don 't have any difficulty with that I I do well can the the I 'm just trying to work what is the expectations around consultation with affected communities and community boards if you 're saying as part of the annual plan process I have no problem if you are we 've already been out to the community boards we 've already been out to the community on this and they actually have the cross section out there are no documents to make only yes as long as there 's part of the annual plan and you 're not expecting us to another round of consultation I 'll but that you could the project through the annual plan process as part of that we are brought into affected communities and we are talking to community board so maybe take that last ones have you been to the Hagley Faramir community board this is the original proposal went through every community board when it went out in 2014 I think my understanding because it 's got all I was just looking it up on the board it 's got all the cross sections and it 's got all the intersections in it we went out as part of a combined combination between ourselves and in zip ta okay I 've got I 've got questions from Paul next then Jimmy y minus around cycle safety as well know the saying these standards are the members one point table we had an issue and main road and red cliffs where the cycleway was going to take out over all parking and the community were pretty upset about it and they were told they could not go down at one point two so I think we were stuck with 1.7 so right yeah i mean standards we have the cycle that they won them at one point seven eight the ox rods minimum is down it was down at one point two and just in terms of that the park in there is that this section of cranford street will have no parking on it effectively the parking limping given over to traffic when we went through the very prolonged consultation period around the notes of requirement and we 've got a number of submission I can 't think of very many to mention the loss of parking us all their issues that raised but the park another big issue pillows this is just a real mix of stairs yes I mean it is that we recognize in fact it is it is the absolute minimum but it 's recognizing the fact that there will be the confidence cyclist so we use it and also the fact they 'll be limited in numbers because of the fact that we 're expecting most cyclers will be counted cross revenue what 's that song so generally you would not well I mean it here 's to the know I mean we there are locations around the city elsewhere will we provide them at one point to sample of that on the approach to a Clyde road you can see it in example and that 's very similar to what we 're proposing here in this case one of the proposals of the major cycleways oh so we are preferring people to go on the pepper nori power or rather than this and this one is because we don 't think we 'll get all those people over there because of those lycra clared you know people beside to you what you don 't do yeah it 's just biked here isn 't getting service members I can water straighter than others Thank You Jimmy okay thank you yeah so one question what 's the relation there your particular mation if these the project post section eight the budget has been put into the annual plan the weather is the capital program am i right it will be if it goes back into the annual planet will be formed part of the capital program yet but and it delivered ultimately there 's a recognition of the fact that it 's you know it 's effectively very very strongly linked to NZT as northern arterial melt away which has been built to the north of qe2 so in terms of delivery the intention is to deliver it all as a single project and that 's the reason we 're going through this procurement process now alongside nzta i 'm still cancel wider is madder to be reviewed or overall petty in the annual plan to rebuild well as a particular will release one separate upon the other organ also made the budget and the concept goes through the annual plan design work that these guys are doing so yeah basically we be when you approve the long-term plan you took this project out and it 's going back in and the draft annual plan so in a draft annual plan depending on submissions this won 't go ahead if you don 't get if if you don 't approve that going through into the annual plan however we believe the best procurement is it 's a 250 million dollar get some benefits of it being delivered together and we 're just saying they need some certainty around how to price that however we cannot and we won 't be pressing the button on it until we get the funding through the annual plan process and that will be consulted with the affected communities and whatever however we just need the details so that they can actually firmly firm up a price prior to that time and the problem really is with that that if we can 't give the potential proponents that level of detail they will register that as a risk in the way their price is singing as a result of that they will offer the price of the project and so it will cost us more money ultimately we we can 't provide him with this is this this certainty now thank you thank you clean up next thank you I think if this report although cycling and cycleways dominate this report i 'm actually not peers it 's about cycle ways or the four-laning of cranford screams well now look at the schematics that 's street in there are cycleways and that 's what you know the modish modal shift we 're encouraged well will this I mean what this effectively is it 's a discussion about the potential cross sections that will that will be built there if we proceed with the for learning of crown forestry and that 's that 's the thing is that if we proceed so that that 's a debate that will be hard through the annual plan process so when you talk talking about those cross-sections the issue really is how you fit all the constituent parts within the existing rail reserve the 20 point 1 meter wide row reserve so an effectively what with the critical issue is how you manage cyclists within that corridor and there 's three choices that you 've got which is going on the cross sections one is that you provide an unrolled cycle lane another is that you don 't provide anything just provided a very wide track waiting for traffic and cyclists to share the other one is the fact you provide a much wider shared cycle footpath on either a multi-criteria analysis and came to the conclusion that the safest one was to do the on-road cycle ends and that was reflective basically the the kind of cyclists who would use a room so yes it is about the four-laning but it assumes the for learnings in places the discussion about the cycle provision within that four laning contact so it is about four laning because that 's a major issue within itself this is calling out consultation on that four laning and it got heard by an independent panel of hearing and they came back saying yes with all those objections in that community yes that will go ahead of the four-laning mr. detail however they said any one of these three cross sections meets the criteria rather than saying we think this is the best one and that 's why the decisions coming so that reports already gone you haven 't_''_843.65 agreed to fund it yet so it 's not actually happening but if it did happen that 's been subject to a whole range of all already consultation and hearings which has come back to an they lift this I 'm not sure floating but they said we are happy with either of those however we now need to give something to the contract just what they would price them and what we are recommending if it goes are here we believe the safest and the best is actually keep the kick them off the footpath and actually give them a separate Lane even though it 's a small line it 's just more or less lame just a wee bit more background on that I mean the three cross sections you see there there came out of the notice of requirement hearing that when we went into the hearing process we had an entirely different cross section and some people who submitted on that expressed concerns about that and as a result of that we went through a long process where we looked at these potential design so what the three designs you 're seeing there are as a direct result of consultation that we 've already done as part of the notes of require the processor people I 've had a really you know okay thank you if there 's the questions is it is it a question yeah go for it yeah um thank you just have two questions one is um my understanding is that this doesn 't meet the standards the injured ta manual of traffic signs and marking minimum standards which is basically you can have one point two monstrous cycle lanes we 're vehicle speeds of like 40k and below and where it 's not possible to have a lot of South alone so it doesn 't say oh so advice that I previously had is that one point two is only permissible on those circumstances according to that so does this design meet the into too many of traffic night- I 'm those i can 't i 'm not sure what your furniture but my son is it meets the off-road standards which ones really designed to and that was tested through the hearing and confirmed through the earring sorry hey hey okay so but there 's a new zealand in there is an endearing manual signs and markings the race for there 's also wash water standards in the City Council 's current cycle design guidelines promoters are or what the 1.8 to two meters yeah yeah so we 're going against our oil well we 've got in this situation we 're not able to meet those because of the fact that we can 't fit that in with existing designation if you were if we have to provide cycle ends in this section at 1.8 meters you would need an additional 1.2 meters of width on that cross section you wouldn 't be able to provide sufficient with which they 're of traffic lens and footpaths within the existing rob reserve and therefore we can 't fit that in I think the guidelines also are for our major cycleways area as has already been explained and this is not part of that major we are store encouraging people to go on the pepper new apparel so um that 's where we would like people to go so this is does week traffic standards it meets the standards that we 've adopted as counsel and look I 'm sorry I don 't know what the NZ you 're referring to there but it does actually meet safety standards that have been adopted for Australasia and we 've adopted intimate so I I mean my biggest concern is that when creating an unsafe recycle way and I know from experience in Palo nine on our ward we 've repeatedly being told that we can 't have smaller cycleways and we 've made decisions on them on their faces we 're now four-laning a section of road putting a cycleway which has got one point to which is the you know the bare minimum what so and we 've also got an increase in heavy vehicles yes and it worse so I 'm just trying to understand um how this passes any sort of safety audit in terms of water behavior rather than I know the modern will say one thing and we hear this all the time but in terms of human behavior and the reality of the heavy vehicles that are we using that 's the speed of the traffic how can we be reassured that this is actually saying the the each of those three were taken back to the safety auditor who did the secular on the initial scheme for the notes of requirement and she recommended of those threes cross sections that the one we 're takin to you notice this is the reason why we 're here well that is the one that we take forward from a safety perspective that is the most appropriate to use now you know I think we have to be up front and said because of this issue of the existent having too fickle in existing Road wizard there 's a degree of compromising that absolutely but that 's because of that we can 't secure a designation to go any wider but as I said that the critical partners week we were very specific in ensuring that our designers went back to the safety auditor to review each of those projects and make a recommendation to that which one they work on third and that information was fed through to the commissioners when they actually set those four cross section those three cross sections and they will sit there okay very young sure why cuz just looks at the three options there 's a median strip obviously down but and I see in the report that talks about people who yes yeah it 's a bit of a safety however it 's quite it 's two meters if I 'm looking at that correct well there 's different wigs provided is our association it 's two weeks yes yeah now we 're looking at a shell for path because this whistle one that I preferred and I see in the report to that that was the other one that came up as well it was pretty yes so the shared psychopath is there any way that you 've looked at or could you look at reducing the median so that we can actually have a shared cycle paths with the cyclists off the road and separated but hit with more room because of thing the the critical issue that came up in the safety discussions when we were going through their not so the current process was the width of the median now our original proposal had a very narrow point six meter wide medium people crossing there was real concerns that people would still try and cross so therefore the there was a lot of discussions that they 're not a requirement hearing about the need for a median to be provided at a wider width and that specified that we provide and median at a minimum of 1.8 meters diameter native what I mean to a degree that 's what was just discussed as part of the hearing is this I mean theoretically we could you know you could quite easily take ten centimeters off of that and put it on to the shared path but that still wouldn 't give you a great level of service and it would still put you back with it was still cause of safety issues which are you thought you would have cyclists moving a pretty high speed along a shared cycle foot bath with pedestrians and doing that very close to drive words with people reversing out now if you know drivers when you reverse out you can see very very little often in terms of what you can see up and down the street done there it 's a 35 k an hour straight into the back of reversing can be thrown off into my next question so have you done any modeling around the number of pedestrians we 've not done any we haven 't got a pedestrian model in Council we 've got a cycle model which shows that the use of this will be pretty limited full cycle is because so many a kind of use that pop a new car but we don 't have a pedestrian model the other thing that I would just look you know thinking about the cyclists that are going to use this they actually will drive down the road they won 't actually go on to the footpath even if we made a shared footpath and so we are then going to even further promis-- because I think you 've got to think about the kind of people that are going to use it I 'm sorry I wouldn 't go down a shared footpath on my road bike we might do it on my mountain bike on the road bike I 'll go pipe because I 'll be going up and down paths like that the people that are using this of the people that we are saying and not the commuter not the people that are going into the pepper new apparel so I think we would build a facility that probably wouldn 't be used in an actual fact that would not be appropriate for the kind of people that were going to use that facility okay Paul squeezin probably it is a strong a comparison to get back to main road it and every question you first talked about on and there is flexibility and reducing the median we took out the medium is how we got our car back you back so yeah I look at that as at 1.8 meters wider see that you could reduce it at 1.4 meters an air 2.4 of a meter onto the onto the cycle well it 's a condition of consent the 1.8 meters was very explicit as a condition of concern it was in see was insisted upon by this same issue in read close this is a whole line that 's the condition of concern and the one point a I think was predicated on the fact that 's that the minimum with sufficient to allow somebody with a crown to pause in the middle of broad offered off of the curve so if he chopped it down which one that you could have septic a say in that regard as long and there was subject from community consultation that 's with it okay thank you so what I 'm going to do now is that if there 's any debate and i 'll just put Paul on your amendment is seconded by ally yeah yep so can I put that first those in favor please say aye all right those opposed so that becomes part of the motion is through need abate Danny yeah I can 't support this I 'm really still concerned about the safety aspects of it it would be interesting to get the crash statistics for cyclists around some of these neuropsychol ways just actually see what 's been happening the city but when I think of some kind of psycho ways that I traffic goes around the corner and you know it just it inherently to me feels unsafe when you think about the fact that we 're going to have we 've just made a submission asking for wider trucks on our rights this is a road that is going to be taking trucks it 's probably going to be taking buses which will also be wider in the future so 1.2 is so narrow and I don 't think provides sufficient space at all and it just really really worries me that you know it 's I and then Paul and I go through us a lot because we 've had a lot of capital works and some of the areas where we 've had all the engineering advice all the safety port same things are safe and you go and talk to the local community and we just had it with Ken and hill road coming into very very me bridge 50 people at that meeting all felt unsafe using that intersection so sometimes actually and we have a favorite saying around here that the wisdom of the community sometimes exceed the technical wisdom on the experts and like you know that the thing is that the people that are using these things and the human behavior element often has missed out of some of the model and goes through some of the central city project try and tune into hagley park on 10s of straight with to UV vehicles on your side and you can just see that although I 've might meet the minimum standards actually it doesn 't feel very safe and that 's my biggest concern with this cross section um I am concerned about the other issues to that you know the wider context we heard people say actually it 's a very parallel consultation that they wanted separated cycleways through this area through this route rather than what we were doing and if you think about spending I don 't know what we 're spending on that cycle way in particular buts 18 million this is a hundred million to increase the flow of traffic and that 's what this is doing four-laning I rode through a community I think we 'll have adverse for the community in terms of building community so I won 't support this today I just think it 's too many questions about the safety and actually it goes against what we 're trying to achieve us the city is yani le um I am going to support the staff recommendation but with some pretty major reservations I still feel that we 're trying to make a silk purse out of a sow 's ear and I think that if we put a same sort of amount of effort energy time and money into looking at rail then as we are into the psycho ways we would actually be able to take a lot of vehicles off the road and make it safer for people and take freight off the road and whenever I raised rail people say to me well you know we 've got to look at a citywide strategy well here we are putting in a major cycleway network without looking at something like rail which is an infrastructure we already have in place I 'm concerned about the speeds down this road I 'm concerned movements and pedestrian movements however I see what the experts of which I 'm not one say on this and I will be voting for it but with some reservations Thank You Pauline yes thank you and I will say that the environment committee also spent a long long time on this and we had workshops prior to their ten workshops with the scaly part furry community board who were generally supportive as well and the thing is that the northern arterial the NZTA is going to work on that project and they 've convinced infect the Kappa Tony 's dream realignment is nearly getting towards the end of completion i believe so work has started the it 's up to us to prepare for mitigation for the effects trailer community and as part of our resolution in july we agreed that we acknowledge the concerns expressed by the residents in San Albans each we 're in earnest Road areas and the staff will continue to work closely with the infrastructure transport Environment Committee the shitty papanui community board and the community on planning and implementation of the traffic management communities this is to be progressed by developing a range of options to address community concerns end with consulting with the community and these options do include northern rail options potential use of address street by beta Street hills road to relieve some traffic volumes on cranford and but these can 't continue the business cases can 't continue it has begun I believe but we need more funding through the air yeah so I 'm hopefully what we 're doing here is actually continuing with the design if we were to halt the design phase we would perhaps potentially include higher costs to put that up again later so I 'm supportive of this this is the safest option out of three and as you know we have got the papanui parallel going in there and that will that will provide a really safe cycling option for other people wanting to travel north on their bikes so we did spend a lot of time on this it 's not easy cramming for lane to that street we know that there are concerns but I can see no other option 'll put it that 's a key component to separate you want one or two separate okay I 'll do that yep okay just quickly I will support it it 's an interesting report because it 's also about the four-laning of painful scream anyway that that 's just looking at the cycle lane you imagine 1200 that 's night before sheet of gym so you know that 's a reasonable with to go down as a cyclist myself I 'm pleased that it 's there although there are some no infiltrates really problematic I 'm happy that 's there but but I 'm really happy about us number two because I think we 've got to get as much buying as we can over this if we go to make us six they solve it so Hector support okay Andrew I think we need to take this decision in context I mean this is the design that will be used assuming this passes today if the four-laning project goes ahead and as Pauling 's amendment addresses that 's a matter for the annual plan we 're not de facto making the design decision today but looking at what 's been put in front of them what 's been discussed around the design on page 60 we 've got the graphic of the three options of those three figure 1 is clearly in my view the most sensible solution it 's the only one that gives us the designated cycle lane combining cycle and traffic isn 't something that we I imagine would support and we 've also heard from a cyclist today around the shared cycle and footpath and the disadvantage to both cyclists of a certain type and pedestrians regarding that so when I look at page 60s and no brainer that we would go for the the cross section in figure 1 the staff recommendation the other option of course which has been discussed his option two which is to do nothing and I note in paragraph seven point five point one the continued provision of a two lane road with limited pedestrian crossing facilities and no dedicated cycle line so if the debate is about cycle lanes well the do-nothing approach has no dedicated cycle lane the carriageway has got a certain size and the three figures on page 60 really discussed that graphically and we 're making the best that we can of the space available and I 've heard the concerns around safety but really this is making the best of what we 've got to give as much safety as we can to cyclists and pedestrians and coming up with a set of traffic flows that work in the context of another project that may be approved through the annual plan in terms of the design I support this today for those reasons thank you guys and did Ellie did you seek in this I I second of the second but ok right is there a seconder for the substantive motion now Andrew you okay it 's even did Andrew ok so I 'll put them in two parts per item one gets there before you those in favor please say aye aye those opposed no carried and the second part those in favor please say aye aye as opposed carried thank you guys there is a cup of tea at the air report would go down d speaks going to might come back here at eleven fifteen or the CEOs for what I believe them okay _"

happy about right okay okay ah sorry like has it been any consideration given to connections of the cycleways sorry so she saw the leave so that the sexy scene p is considered this sideways route through cranford our project does essentially go beyond what the EMP is trying to achieve but strictly between interesting so yes there is integration with the cycleways planning through those other

is there what are you moving it almost moving I 'll see Eddie committees pastor chand written you look recommended it yep so Pauline seeking it you need debate just one question court rotational debate I was just concerned that they make reference in the report to embedding it in before the election because I would have thought that this would be something that new councils coming in here as they work through the training or agreement they work through the urban development strategy they work through their relationships would actually want to have this up you know the autonomy to make yeah i think so i think the south i 'm here but charge that but i in fact each council will retain its own decision-making in fact that it 's really about setting up a process which will work more effectively so in fact new council coming in or councils will be in effect a vehicle available and new councils will be able to make further decisions about how that vehicle works but it 's more than that though as we understood it at a tea and in will correct me if i 'm wrong this would have to be decided on again by each cancer indeed I would think so yes be little quickly and I 'm sure the others a few times okay and just fine just to clarify these no removal of delegated decisions that we currently exercise particularly around things like community boards heey swelled as reference in the report it 's good that ran his arrived she can speak to this probably bit hidden like in but steer reference on the report that in fact the decision making for example around bus shelters but that has yet to be decided so in effect that is like a separate issue today we it any suggests a minute we were moved from community there 's no solution at all me was it was entirely up to each council would okay yeah Jimmy thank you only the time friend you know the equations we reviewed on the page 25 the last paragraph in here is a principal you we are taught today by the stop where you know the established agreement and also establish this joint committee I 'm not sure that I 'm friend for instant because while ur this council probably would aspire October am i right either I 'm not sure if after the women new concept even view how to mitigate this affect the new cats was a different view and then yes tofranil committee okay that 's what we just don 't know if I 'm here and because yeah it 's established even principal really today in some basic grating it going might be edition uptight but we don 't okay so move so and seeking to Pauline that 's right i 'll put that those in favor please sorry i mean i think i think given that really just as neither here nor there and okay get it set up but i think it just raised me the wider question as well that we should be thinking about it you want to approach the apps and may just cycleways as well so i don 't i would just hope that if we can look at some wider issues around transport because it 's not just about public passenger transport the irony in the region is we 're spending a lot on cycleways but then other partners have got roads being widened with no cycleways and if you 're going from sell one or why met into the city you 'd actually want to join up approach to a cycleway so i just wonder whether as huddled this process could be consideration of other things that may actually make sense it original liberal you talk about rail well possibly row or whatever but it does seem that I mean that 's probably covered in public passenger transport but for example the submissions around the changes to taxis and overs and all those sorts of things I know we joint committee that involves a whole pile of our people that will we 've been keen to keep all that electric vehicle over that 's of course done twice so it doesn 't actually involve those I mean it could at some stage but this does not suggest that it indeed others are not suggesting can I put the motion those in favor no those in favor please say aye all right that 's opposed carried _"

    "text": "working that 's you enjoy this is easier yep I 'm not happy to make some opening remarks on this and I 'll suggested also an additional one that came up and we while ago about the allegations to community boards such that they don 't have to ask us to take their strengthening communities fund and put it into discretion we got there kept with it somewhere yeah so we 're about to catch a bit as well Andrew yeah sure so um this funding review working party has been meeting for the last 18 months or so and we 've been tasked with a review of the way that council does its funding and a number of requests or yeah a number of requests for things to consider came out of the metropolitan funding meeting last year and also there have been issues raised in annual plan and long-term plan consultations that we 've taken into account as well so the proposals of the Working Party that are in front of us today aim to reduce compliance costs both for council and four groups that are applying by requirements and this is around easier access to funds faster decision-making reducing compliance costs and reducing the time spent by both groups and council on making applications and assessing applications increased flexibility of the way that funds can be applied so that good initiatives are able to be funded and so that grassroots activity is encouraged and so that partnerships with council are encouraged in a match funding type Arrangements council through this set of recommendations has an ability to show that we absolutely recognize the key role that communities play and community groups play in achieving the social outcomes and objectives that we 're looking for and an ability to show continued commitment to funding community groups and communities to achieve their objectives and that we continue to support that in a way that allows them the flexibility and the ease of access to these funds and so the funds can be distributed in the most equitable one okay thank you for um look I 'm happy with the recommendations now it 's not big on the committee I I 'm pleased though that section D 2 does cover 's good that now finally funding for early learning centers will be based on need there 's a process for them my consumed being that with a white with it being a wider fund that the early learning centers who not only have great needs but in fact server support parents and kids who are living in poverty that in fact they may miss out now i 'm confident having chip with staff in looking at this carefully that in fact that should not happen in fact the case for funding for those early learning centers it will be enough will be announced that they will gain it so i 'm quite happy to support the recommendations neo2 okay Thank You Ellie um yeah I actually had a couple of questions and I don 't know whether I 've missed it my eyes father actually know quite fear I should have got ya here for Christians make yes and some of the front and just my eyes weren 't working properly last night when I looked at this and I could not see any information related to the youth ideas fund when it comes to amounts or criteria have I missed it in the report no no so I mean if these funds are approved by council you know to start with you need to go away and develop oil under proposed criteria in the mountain is a mock-up on page 4 44 or 45 into 446 an attachment see attachment see or hear some details about each one so on say again if you look you can see last two pages all right boy and here 45 have got a mock-up of it funds so that 's the information they 're both very small funds so they might be up to two thousand and one or whatever quite quick I mean yeah so my question based on that then is when we first came to office I know that they were concerns raised around the council table about how fractured and all over the place our funding system is and where money goes and where it doesn 't ooh where it can come from and so forth do you not see that this will infect through the fractured age responsive to the emergent needs in these these new fans have been discussed as a result of people seeing emergent needs in the community where we need to be quick support innovation provide an opportunity to be able to engage with a organization or a piece and very quickly get the money out and those kinds of things I think that they 'll be a very interesting opportunity for people to navigate their way into funding with the otherwise might not have enough in the past for example you 're at it as it cooled out the box and it 's truly up knowing no I 've never heard about it 's like it yep it 's perfectly calm story round and a light bulb moment funds so very little things that want to get underway sort of within the next month quick fast big turnaround so the suggestion well one of them is up to a thousand one of them is up to 5,000 which at the moment in terms of discretionary response fund staff have delegated authority up to 15 anyway don 't they and so it 's 's what the youth what they fund looked at especially in community matching and we don 't have anything and place out of our dozens and dozens of frozen way to fund that could either be tweaked adjusted or made more efficient maybe we do and that 's why that so that these are mock-ups of ideas and and it may be that these work more efficiently so at the moment you can only go to a community board for something that you just want to do locally if you if it 's something that affects metropolitan it could come through the discretion response but these ones might be something that you can do we quicker the youth one is actually targeted at young people having ideas that they want to do Pauline so sorry and this should be questions my apologies i took debate for your questions you might sufficient yep yep on page 416 in its ok l can i get stuff to just talk us through the cross unit working party that we 're looking at it and is it let me say first unit this your there had um the focus of the work was predominantly looking at strengthening communities funding um however the terms of reference for the funding review working group indicate that there and maybe and need to look at other streams of funding so there could be other grant streams potentially line items with something that was minuted some of the discussion it would be useful to have a mandate from council to be able to do that work together with other units yep good and the other question is um I couldn 't see them here as we didn 't talk about making the indication forms a lot easier for people is it in here somewhere not not well I mean it is it 's covered but that 's sort of another body of work as well coming up it is yeah involves ongoing technical IT stuff because it 's all integrated yeah sorry and we also did discuss perhaps looking at other funding organizations and perhaps more unifying the forum sort of feedback from your community is just oh how I love you from it on you know if we quite complex for them to do so good loot thank you okay jaani region ad well I was just trying to understand if there was any resolution around the inflation adjustment yes does it that 's not that 's Jay on page 4 12 we just do it as part of the independent of the long-term my wallet in here is the long-term plan Delta P so changes the money go through the annual planning process so are we going to get a pay for this in your phone to say do you wish to inflation-adjusted weekend that 's presently what I would support we seem to do we don 't we seen the job just automatically for cct and CDC which I don 't quite understand why we couldn 't just make a decision before maybe it 's this rather than have a big debate no yeah here 's a benefit no not through and it has come to counsel before but neither got through if we could slowly but then I guess I just wanted I 'm not I think it 's more of a policy because I so anyway that 's cool um I had concern over the early learning centers last time that this issue came up a number of them were quite concerned to have been you know just at least communic insulted so I just wondered whether that 's something that we should actually go and consult on with the center 's and I 'm mindful that we 've also asked for work to be done around the leasing policy so I don 't think you can I 'm just wondering how you can sit right up the like the lack of ring-fencing versus those other requirements around to get a consistent leasing policy you know for it for example the skirt companies don 't pay anything to go on council land and hey let 's not get into those but just in terms of the evolution the early learning centers will any of them be surprised by this they 've all been spoken to by their local advisors thank you very much and what I think they like to appreciate being women contact in thia always considering is you know that the chance be cut and we 're very interested in ensuring that the funding kids to those and greatest need in I think it 's just clear inconsistent communication with the ERC 's we 've got good relationships with them across the city in working with them is where you find out information and working more closely with property in the Rings at that side of the word in the funding side of the week is so we 're doing work around the rent that we charge a normal prices and that will come back as part of it yep hey thank you only I 'll just sorry just another question um just in regards to the criteria I just if you get a page four to three you 've got the revised criteria gambling in prize money has been removed retrospective cults have been removed yadet religious active ministry has been removed it just seemed to me that there 's some pretty fundamental principles of things that we probably wouldn 't want a fun visit as 0 from the right tire one of you there we 're now making eligible which behind removing those I mean there 's other ones in there that I agree worth what but um but just in terms of the ones that wouldn 't really in my ask the front HTS well what specific ones um okay well I 'll go through um so um stock or capital market investment gambling or prize money entertainment course I 've got a question mark around you know alcohol and hospitality versus actual events small claims tribunal professional disciplinary body hearings and then the ones where the activities of initiatives with a primary person to promote religious ministry political chicos commercial or proper orientated interests the medical and health care costs one other question mark as well okay just those ones that have been removed on page four to three I mean I think I think the idea was that we simplify the criteria to give elected members I guess greater flexibility and how they fund more strategically you know it 's not saying that if we can application for something like this as staff and our advisors understand responsibly use of rate payer money and wouldn 't recommend just simplify that criteria bring it in line so we 're sort of consistent with the wards at the metropolitan level but again it 's it 's you know if it comes to council it doesn 't have to be funded just because it 's been removed so for something like game anymore I personally would feel more comfortable more explicit about about that yep so you want to keep gambling or prize money as a restricted there yeah I don 't think anybody have any objections of it so you is anybody got any problem with it I just want to rather than going through each one today is it possible to ask for a revised exclusion list so could we possibly go through this exclusion list only at chiede is that creative yep i 'll be happy to get it right just the exclusion list so far yep the legal challenges in room yeah yeah yes that includes the entire especially so that includes page 14 23 only and thank you for Pacific oh yeah sorry yep okay thank you jaani Jimmy I 'm facing the issue my I 'm not different equation this because this is a new kind of funding stream especially sorcery category use idea out of Parts crime whether they 'll have any plan you know or for a time frame for kind of funding application of workshops a manner to give the community fully understand because the new string otherwise they lost the opportunity to apply for because each one community should be equal opportunity thank you okay thank you fill your needs I missed you thank you I guess and whenever a ring-fenced fund that has changed and was in the ring as a head been for the early learning centers the some risk that in fact some early learning centers may lose it so I guess one thing is can you assure me though that as I indicated before they 're in areas where this high I need that those early learning centers will not be disadvantaged it 's exactly what key by the new process she said she wanted to funding to go into areas of highest need you work in end and I 'm just wondering to to to because some some learning centers where early learning centers where parents will be in the middle where people on average incomes near may be struggling to pay rents all that kind of thing Tilly if if some reads me remove from renewing centers will be some influence on a lot of people potentially so I 'm just wondering just what counsel you handsome referred to before in terms of deciding on the criteria if in fact the early learning centers or represented from them could also be involved in that process so it is part of the consultation in blue I 'm just wanting to be just to clarify that if we should just doesn 't please no do it next time yeah do we need a note that way or just do it off at leas just undertake until do yeah okay it 's 10 um I 'm on the three-point 22 I just so it 's going to go into the pot and letting on to what the others are talking about is there any risk that the pot would be empty by the time say a learning would be no I mean it 's a really subsidy basic one of these actual monies come to the to the Metropolitan working group for decision so the actual numbers come before you or at the time of the grants yeah okay okay rev did you have question I did I did um yeah the early learning stuff centrally on me I 'm I always struggle when we let government off the hook in terms of responsibilities for funding some of this stuff and I hope we continue to sort of push for them to make sure their funding early learning properly and but for me it 's them the bit where you say that you are reducing well increasing clarity and reducing compliance costs and just just feels to me like you 're creating more complexity around the number of new funds or quite small grants and I 'm just wondering where you feel or is there any information here about the compliance costs that you reduce in terms of the numbers you think that are going to be reduced by not in this report so there 's a the funding working party by December on how we can further reduce those transaction and compliance costs these new funds again just reiterating what 's already being said the idea as as to trial at a metropolitan level you know similar to what 's happening out in the wards for you know quick response of small amounts for new ideas so that you know compliance and translation costs for those would be low would be very quick turnaround why why would they be lower I mean if you 've got someone applying for a saying under one under they won 't say four hundred dollars I could quite easily see the four hundred others being cheered up in people actually processing the application because you know Summers 's are some young person goes on four hundred dollars to make a video about what what tell me how do you assess that you 've got to go through the process you 've got to make sure it 's kosher make sure that the person is who they say you know that that takes time and processing and so as these grants processing rises as a percentage of the grind you 're giving out so but you 're saying that compliance basic Orleans I 'm just from the delegations to that it 's the same out in the wards to two small amounts of funding it they are staff right report and recommendation and it goes up through and to you to make decisions so depending on how the delegations for the distribution of the new plans go they would what if there was a staff delegation or certainly the funding review working party head the delegation to approve this funding it would reduce the time having to come through the council process to to a board meeting yes it 's one I gave that velocity but when you 're presenting something like this and you 're talking about reducing compliance costs but you haven 't provided any numbers on actually what those costs my fear or how you reducing the one how much money was saving or how more efficient it 's being it 's not quite clear and we could provide some analysis around yeah yeah compliance cost and speed thanks to you we should be fast anyway can I just reduce that in terms of yannis suggestion there that Andrew was okay with their attachment a the detailed revisions to criterion policy and I suggest we delegate that to cheat yeah I don 't always counsel as a comfortable with that I don 't see a need for that come back here i don 't think the heli nature 's was just okay so move dyani seconded andrew that attachment a the detailed revisions to criterion policy further review be delegated to cheat sorry you need to write that okay so it will be in addition that attachment a pages for 222 wire 36 clarification does that go back through the working group first I think Chico do it don 't just conscious support we have on the agenda load up okay just you and the detailed revisions to criteria in policy go for further review and debt that be delegated to the cheap committee okay so are we good now can I ask another question please yep yep can I just clarify so the information that rests asked more efficient and will save in to what degree the mock-up that is there is that exactly what we 're going with so so that 's a mock-up obviously we 'll need to develop some further okay salute so what we asked for the fact that this is what we may not be going work and you are asking us to authorize the opening of these new pilot funding streams and we don 't have all of the information to make that decision that you fear so they open in july yeah so these ones would open in the first of july so anything you know sorry i don 't here with the open in the same horizonte 18 you are asking us to authorize the opening of these three new funds we don 't have any visibility on what saving it provides and how and we don 't have any confirmation of how they will actually work on what the Christ will come back to the funding review working patty as I understand injury so the reason that they don 't open now is because there is ably bit then as I understand it they can to the food they 're thinking if you were at least not comfortable sorry we are supervising the opening of three funds as I see that no matter whether they open in six months two weeks or four years we 're authorizing the opening of three new funds on G and we have those other points that I just raised and if anyone can tell me I 've got that wrong please do yeah the concept that that 's here is is one to make it simple and obviously not all of this work has been done that 's why they don 't open until july i get there and when there is further we get there having been done okay I 've made my point in this case radio okay um so this is moved by Andrew seconded 54 and I haven 't got to meet any other amendments except what 's here which is three and four can I put them yeah just in terms of day d yep I run the early learning centers oh how does he make it to it but I 've such as one I added that the issue of the charging marine level is being and some time frame on there so you want deez dealt with separately I 'll do that yeah and a resolution that just makes it clear that we are I 'll deal with these separately which are now put the rest those who favor please say aye sorry are we putting the whole thing yes i 'll just put six it d sorry but i can 't i can 't sign off gee I 'm sorry secretly so I can 't through there okay that 's right you just vote against le yeah but are you putting the whole lot yeah except for D which is what I 've been requested to what separately sorry I can 't hear the film yep okay I 'll put those those in favor please say aye aye those opposed carried and then yani wants d I put separately at so can I assume that everybody was happy with three and four the staff to allow community boards to do that directly and that I 'm wondering whether that just needs to be a little bit clearer Chad 's going to make a final decision on that it 's going to review it delicately sorry excision be delegated and end the decision be delegated to cheat sorry attachment do television two criteria and get lean go Beck go back to shed for further review and a final decision yeah yeah yeah just makes it absolutely yeah thanks yeah ok so I 'll put three and four just in case we didn 't put those those in favor please say aye aye opposed carried and then yannis ask that the learning center 1db put separately and did you want to move something how many my preference would be that I 'm still worried about the consultation so what do you want to move well I just wanted to check whether we could consult on this through the annual plan alongside the new changes to the leasing policy because it 's kind of hard to just make a decision on one so for example if we 're charging a dollar for the nonprofit community centers three to read Saturday but if we 're charging for worker right but what do you want to actually move um what I 'd like to move that two things one is that we note that work is currently underway on a revised leasing policy for nonprofit community groups on council land into that I met the guys capture have you got there or not for profits on council land well this should be with him really well no is Thea cuz they 're not should they be lacing policy that can 't you cancel and then signed off quietly Christmas but so we probably better not note something that 's not happening no more weeks faster Council resolution ama so they came for our community because we 're getting so many different community groups thank you I just clarify any is there anything additional underway I 'm not that I 'm aware of and I can keep with them Angus to check but I haven 't seen another lesson policy that come through so i just need to go be so we probably shouldn 't note it if it 's okay then I 'll just move there um day be subject to consultation through the draft and your plan process can I just clarify with Ian I 'm sorry were you doing something I just remember last time this happy yeah can I just clarify so Yanni we 're just talking about item D which is the ring cleansing and strengthening communities fund for the early learning centers yeah he wants to make clothes d subject to consultation through the draft and your plan process yes is there any problem with that ok so that 's a problem here yep I just wonder if from discussion with the with the operators the people who run the unloading centers were applying for the funds effects in fact what we just need to make a note and that 's happening isn 't it clear see that would be in heaven okay right so I think okay so I 'm just going to put d take the amendment out sorry guys so just d I 'm just going to put separately now move counselor tuna seconded cancelled Lee water I 'll put that no just about recorder and he anyone says both recorded against okay so that 's that report as a whole I 'll move it again just in case most and reading the poem that the reports a whole we received those in favor please say aye I supposed carried thank you _"

    "text": "lovely urban development or either urban development strategy and plantation thank you so everybody 's recently familiar with us I think I think one of the things that we wanted to look at was a refresh of the terms of reference such that it and people could not be there that they could actually have deputies which have proxy have other people represent or alternate alternate says the word and because at the moment that 's not a process that works right um to change the terms of reference that apply to the UDS I see that we need to be a decision made by the UDS I see so that we probably need to be a paper that was discussed and put through the the kind of framework that exists to support that to collect money okay so I mean there 's a meeting tomorrow there is a meeting torrent you have two of our people are not going to be able to be there right so one will hit three and we 'll have it has been something that has been discussed on a couple of occasions and three and not have alternates and so it 's not an issue which is not being discussed at hairs being and it 's been there I see it for some of the discussion that was very entertaining but really I 'm not sure how we actually asked for this whether it has to do one of you guys who asked for it oh I mean there 's more than one of you will be guided by Richard and that 's too but yeah the cubby it may be that we could rearrange the issue and making our case especially with atrociously counselors being particularly busy in the mere being away two days and Sam okay Oh Laura should be like well I think it 's pretty important as we 're going through the repressor protein that process that there is an opportunity we have for education I think that may be the case we asked the committee to actually look at alternatives because it 's gonna be cool look at the proper enter through their refresh crises okay so if we ask the committee representatives and to look at our know that the council has asked you maybe as part of the Refresh process I could also ask it 's probably yeah a good way of doing it okay debate yanny then I just wanted to question a comment on what council lonsdale just said I think given the importance just given the importance because the importance that 's been raised it would be good if we were to add to this resolution that we request our representatives on this body to raise this issue sorry that 's all right given the issue that has been raised particularly the issue of the importance of this that has been raised by counsel on style it would be good i think if as part of our decision today we were able to add a number three that said that we request our representatives on this body to raise the issue of alternates and discusses so it and then they can say council passed a resolution asking us to do this so that they 're actually fully representing the city not just putting their own opinion so you 'd like to move it and and somebody will sneak into one qui she uh yani was next and they knew yes two things one is it 's interesting to note on page 45 three it was even noted at the top of every pleasures council annual plan meeting and yet they still didn 't change the day but all but on page 4 55 I 'm really trying to understand the rationale I mean we 've got this memo which doesn 't really explain why they 've suddenly delayed the visioning exercise and I am the I am really questioning whether you know this is the even the right process and whether we can 't use existing processes lie share an idea rather than reinventing and huge duplication of marketing comms and just seems like this crisis is slowing down here when it could just get underway with existing structures because they want to create a new structure so what 's behind the delay and have we thought about other ways of achieving it within the time frame light using our existing resources and campaigns so um in terms of the memo that was and that 's yet to be discussed at the UDS I see so that will be discussed tomorrow so that 's all we have at this point in time and I agree it 's reasonably brief but but I think the concern was that we rush ahead with what would be quite an expensive time-consuming resource-hungry three day workshop without really necessarily having it sufficiently well sorted out what I need to achieve so that was the reason for the delay in terms of the papers that are going up to the UDS I see tomorrow i think the desire is to refresh the document and do that in a slightly more lean and mean fashion rather than necessarily go into a workshop at this point in time but but i think the recognition is that there needs to be a wider piece of work longer term to look at what the UDS is what it seeks to achieve how it 's going to continue to operate so at the moment and that 's all be debated tomorrow so i cant foreshadow what that debate will look like and what the the view of the office of water could appoint you as a proxy for tomorrow that it 's very significant but we don 't gonna have no representation we 've we 're spending quite a lot of money on this process and we don 't really have any say and we don 't have any chance to see what 's been discussed tomorrow so I 'm really unhappy about this but not be could we not suggest that this gets delayed to the next meeting we have representation given and get a briefing to the full council before so we can have a collective position well i think that the majority of the costs associated with the UDF hideous refresh was associated with work so if the workshops not going to hear then a lot of the costs will drop out but but I mean these meetings are set at the beginning of the year or a long time in advance and it 's difficult because all the other attendees from NZTA night are who sell and why make you can need to be there as well it 's soon at this late stage okay so I haven 't got any suggestions of amendments or anything so i 'm going to put what 's here the council understands that will be discussed at tomorrow 's UDS meeting and given that we don 't have representation at that meeting due to it excusing call we do a summer home agency food so that the full council king consider the report and we can have full representation be you asking for the workshop to the report they 're not doing the workshop they 've already cancelled that as we put up as a hunter green now underground or how much money do we put in my car remember we put in choir I thought it was several hundred thousand into this process I 've now cancelled or going to discuss cancelling out and if you look at the dates I mean obviously the workshops haven 't occurred so they cancel that and we don 't really have any understanding i can understand completely where you 're coming from um I 'm just not sure that the council doing this actually has have with the adverse famine they take your money and they do no no no no i 'm not thinking i 'm not doing i 'm not know i mean we have representation on it and that 's the way it works and a clever of leadership style so just in terms of this this is a minute to us really it 's what do you want to do about it is that it 's likely not that 's great that 's simply an update and the purpose of these updates was because while we are while we 're here three representatives on the UDS I see it was simply to provide the rest of counsel with an update on what occurs at those meetings so hence the reason for the minutes I guess the other matter I 'd like to bring to your attention is that this will now sit with Helen Beaumont from now on any resolutions might be might fall in here laughs which is Richard what would a phone ringing so undecided to go here to example with their special housing project which was outside the the decisions like that go back to Council for their making so that the hope my interpretation of the way the UDS IC works it 's very much a collaborative leadership style so it 's it 's it 's not the decision-making committee as such so major decisions about things like esha records or anything else really needs come back to the individual turret or authority or other authority to make that decision we did actually raise our concerns by follow I around their housing accrued yo11 yeah yeah okay i 'm not sure that whatever we pass here is gonna make you find but a different station completely blunt about it but I think the terms of reference would be incredibly useful to review such that when somebody turns up to be a proxy for somebody else they 're not sort of having to go through half our process while the Chairman decides but I think some way the view was that it was good to keep consistency of attendance and the problem was no i 'm seeking identification your process was awful so anyway i 'm not sure amendment I don 't think it was ok so I 'll put the information that 's here but that it 's moved by somebody who 's willing to move this Pauline seeking a date but that those in favor please say aye are they supposed carried thank you item _"

where stage one is now open it up and running you 're operating it it was always going to be a review of some sort at that stage because things have moved from the the planning stage the resource consent stage into the construction and operation central plains water limited it has obviously been responsible for the construction phase the trustee the trust owns the resource consents but have licensed the company to use them the trust is there to make sure that the resource consents are used in accordance with the granting of those consents and it has a mix of night ah who farming environmental representatives and appears to get on and and monitor the things that needs to monitor and manage the things that needs to manage without a great deal of input from either council obviously sell one has more skin in the game than than we do it has a financial funds we don 't have any financial implication any financial interest and the work of the trust so you know also and want to know is are we in or are we out it doesn 't really bother them one way or the other that just would like to know as a sibling we 're we 're obviously going to go out but my question really was is there a need for this council or a desire for this council just although some representation and the only power as we have our to a point it will remove trustees it 's really up to the council as to whether or not at once so all you 're going to decide is worthy withdraw as a set of trust and if you decide against it then you obviously remain as a settler at the trust so are there any other questions of in Johnny yeah um I 'll just so really what we 're talking about is giving up the power to appoint trustees yeah we remove trustees yeah so is easier I can 't see the reason why we would we were concerned about protecting the environment so ensuring that we had trustees that had a focus on environmental or rather than commercial would seem to be inherently God if we want to take to look at some of the outcomes that have caused concern so why would what 's the benefit or how yeah what 's the benefit and not being able point trustees okay I 'm not going to go into bed either for or against on this at the moment with it is what it is we are a Seattle or we have the power to appoint will remove trustees if you want to retain dead interest that 's fine if you don 't then that 's fine too also one wants to do is know whether we 're in or out and and I wasn 't sure which is why it 's come to the committee and the council t and so the recommendation from strategy and Finance run them from being as yeah edrich was a question yes it is um thank you i 'm interested in the relationship between ourselves remaining riveted council remaining the two counselors that we have on the central plains water joint committee is the membership of the Joint Committee directly related to the the weather we remain a settle or issue or are they two separate issues the purpose of the committee was to meet and discuss any issues that might arise with the trust if we 're not going to be a civil there appears little point and remain we on the joint was so the two effects essentially are that we would no longer be able to appoint trustees and we would no longer have that tation on the Joint Committee yesterday and the two are related obviously yeah okay are there any more questions for in oh I don 't make a copy you make a comment but are there any more questions all right okay you 're off the hook in and we 're now under comments Defra first I just want to say that I 'm given the short tight well some of these things can take quite a bit of time if if council want to remain is syphilis so VF I don seem to be a lot of skin in the game for us but for example if council least once remain on and if another council would like to obviously the two I 'm fine with it but basically I don 't have the time to me to attend the meetings give them a little bonus point say they 're okay it 's fine Andrew thinking yeah I 've not heard anything that convinces me that we should withdraw as a settle or I believe that there are potentially and I appreciate there have been very few meetings and very little activity in this space but that 's not to say there wouldn 't be in the future I think there are environmental concerns that we may want to have the ability to be involved in and certainly there are regional economic impacts which come about as a result of central plains water that the city would have some interest in as well so for that reason I would suggest that we remain as a set law I think having two councillors involved is a good idea and I certainly have to continue in that role but certainly would like to look at appointing a second person and I haven 't had this conversation but I was wondering whether um councillor Paul Ian Cotter would be interested in doing that well shall we come to whether we stay as a settler at the trust and then if you want to exert an additional one yeah so you give notice that if that is lost and we stay on that you would like to move in a min meant to a point to additional trustee correct yeah thank you okay fine any other discussion otherwise we 're just going to come to a vote but no just the use of my clean yeah thank you and this is the kind of report in a way you would think is quite an oculus it you know it looks like it could fly under the radar but 2007 and around that time was huge and the whole synchro planes water scheme huge upset in the community so my question here is which way do we go on this do we stay in or not game that in was talking about but politically you know there 's some big questions to think over to mull over and in terms of exercising leverage are we better to stay in or not so I think we just need to proceed carefully my inclination is actually to stay at this point I think it 's spelled set law to lor but i 'm open to counter arguments to me okay are there any other country well I mean I 've looked at this I see no reason for us to be a set under the trust was set up for specific reason that 's being carried out in terms of setting up central plains water we have no shareholding in it no interest in it it 's way outside our boundaries and as we 're often complaining about these people being involved in our business this is a not our business I don 't think we need to be involved people want to be involved with good luck to them but there hasn 't been a meeting for three years and it just seems and nobody 's noticed fruit to ask a question or not no no but you could probably word it in this thing okay all right that 's a good challenge for yelling like I understand what we 're saying and I totally hear what Andrews just see as well oh that one mixed in yeah and I what concerns me as we know about the issues of water related to water in the wider Canterbury area there are some who feel firm more as being taken than should be in as affecting our rivers and the quality of our water so even though it 's outside our boundaries I don 't think it is separate to the city and what affect our city and and that 's the issue that I love what you know I have some concerns about what I intend to do is put one and two separately and when you 've finished yet I don 't know if graph got the questionnaire that one I think you have to understand but no no it was okay good try though is it yawning in the wider context of the work we is and it 's early days and it 's kind of getting developed actually I think we 've acknowledged through that process that water is a regional region-wide issue and my reliance to remove as a settler of this trust and can I say I mean I 've always had strong concerns about the central plains water scheme an impact on the environment and some of the ways and processes by which it was set up and the consent was transferred as a as an asset for a company to get and go and do all sorts of stuff but the reason I support staying in at the moment is to actually understand what what we may be able to utilize being a seat before to get better environmental outcomes of a scheme that 's clearly going to go ahead and of course we 've got a whole three water strategy as well so until we resolve that three water 's strategy I personally can 't see the benefit and giving up a right to be a similar to this trust it may be and as we work through what city and impact that as across the region that we decide actually there is no point and and we get out of it or it may be that we wish to appoint new trustees that have a different focus than a commercial focus and maybe have some environmental understanding and it 's not I mean I don 't want no questions I asked us who are the current trustees and I 've got unless I think from 2012 so it would be good just to check around that because I think there was also a change made a few years ago I run my Tahoe coming on board I 'm not sure of it as a trustee or other the company so there are wider issues at play here and then just whether we want to be remember I first think that we need to improve you know this is not just around central plains but a number of external organizations or committees or the lack of oversight and regular monitoring and correspond it was the same with civic assurance I 'm just reminding you there 's a free night where we need a bit of process to get the advice to the meetings and if we 've got a request to a point atrocity we get a paper come to council around around the process and around the ability to vote and participate and I think that 's near that hopefully we can such a dress but I don 't think that 's a reason to get out of it simply because we haven 't been doing what we should have been doing okay so we have arguments in favor and arguments against and unless there 's any further debate I 'm going to put the first one that canceled receive the information contained in the report movie refseq ended 10 those in favor please say aye I almost carried and then the second one moved ref seconded Jamie and that they 're cancel which drawer is a sector of the trust and what we 'll do is can we just have a show of hands is that ok so if you 're in favor of withdrawing please raise your hand one two bickering it 's going to be um the police raise your hand so that 's more than two okay all right um ok so that 's lost and then you gave notice Andrew that you wanted to move an additional an additional asti is it well but we replace Phil Clearwater as a member of the Joint Committee with another counselor and I 'm suggesting but I haven 't had this discussion with Pauline yes Pauline ok with the suggestion that 's me don 't Pauline be that person ok so the suggestion moved Andrew and seeking dead though or maybe you can 't use your big dinner terms yep is it then fo be replaced on the Joint Committee worth Pauline ok I 'll put there and this is any huge debate those those in favor please say aye those opposed Kerry Pauline took no part and filled up in the park and and is that the only one you 're right so are we through that one now awesome so that 's item three and then that 's that whole item right so we carried that we 've done that one and now we the minutes of 21 January moved red and signal to Jamie but those those in favor please say aye those opposed Kerry item 30 _"

say aye all right Hosie carried public participation and we actually have submissions both of whom have been granted ten minutes each and which is unusual in this forum because it 's usually five months because usually the longer ones go to the committee 's um but first I 've got the brain wave crust Andrea welcome so if you come and speak here and make sure the microphones around of the year we might get a set that 's all you can set we review life of those seats marvelous everybody can hear me and we can hear you and just show you aware of the how it works so you 've got 10 minutes because this is doesn 't normally include questions if there are any questions that people have that they will be included in that email okay that 's perfect thank you so we 've broken all the rules on this one 've killed akoto number in my hammock ER kotha cuts on my 18-year after um warmest greetings to you my name is Andrea doll i am representing brainwave trust today but at the end of last year and the mirror very graciously came in spoke get a relaunch function for brain wave trust here in christchurch and i put it out in at that particular relaunch that i wanted to be able to deliver these presentations to vulnerable families across christchurch and it appears that we may have the funding to do that so the purpose of me being here today is to find out from you which communities you think those presentations should be delivered to and also to ask you for your support and potentially your advice on how we go about doing it so in order to do that I want to explain to you what brain wave trusters and what they do how many of you are familiar was brainwave trust oh good excellent I asked some people coming and earlier and I found that very few weird for those of you who aren 't familiar who was an advocate in hessle was the Children 's Commissioner Leslie max was an advocate for children and parenting Judy Bailey who was obviously the mother of our nation and a woman by the name of Robin fancourt who was a pediatrician from Taranaki came across some information when and they decided that every single person in New Zealand needed to know this and for me so that 's how brain wave trust formed we 're an organization who deliver education and information to people around not only the early years so you 've got a little bit of information in front of you about the early years and how urgent those are but also a breath adolescent brain development so for those of you who are managing adolescence or have managed or a thinking about that stage we can help you with it so that 's kind of what we do okay now how many of you I mean I 'm not a brain scientist I 'm not a psychiatrist I 'm actually a police officer that 's what I do during the day but when I came needs to know this it 's essential that they understand our brains work so I went and I studied so that I could actually deliver this information so are you familiar with your own brains do you know how they work and we all the bits Erin thank you so the bottom lift picture on the screen up there shows the human brain the one above it is actually the one I 'm going to talk to and it 's called it 's a model that we use called the triune model that explains brain development the brain grows from the bottom up and from the bed forward so when you 're born your brain steamers completely online so you can breathe your heart beats your blood pressure works all of those things that actually make us be able to survive work okay but as we grow and as we develop our other cerebellums the other little piece out the Beckley that 's to do with motor skills and also fine tuning of some of their movements that we hear our limbic system is the next piece so if we this the bottom piece if you think about a crocodile a crocodile can lie on the big it can eat that can drink it can sleep and it create can create more crocodiles yeah it 's basically what it does all right it 's the brainstem it 's the function of the brain steam if you move up to the limbic system the limbic system is your emotion so that 's the emotional you 'll member your dog that 's a mammal so if you add a brainstem and olympic system you get a mammal so when your dog is so excited to see you when you come home at night it 's so excited cuz I thought you died oh I beg again and I love them so much I can in the next day same thing because the dog doesn 't have the next but then experts what humans have we have a cortex so brainstem at the beck limbic system in the middle cortex over the top okay and more specifically the prefrontal cortex the last piece to develop this piece at the front here okay that sequential thinking all of those things that 's all prefrontal cortex that 's what makes humans that 's why we 're so special okay let 's also gives us not only the ability to do lots but also the vulnerability to be affected by much so if you have a look at the baby the picture of the baby on the right hand side we are born with genetic potential DNA okay if you think about mahe drysdale and his wife juliet both strapping tall athletic rowers they had a baby quad bronte a wee while ago that baby has the genetic potential to be an amazing athlete if their child bronte spends her life sitting on the couch playing with her iphone and doesn 't move she will not realize that genetic potential so we 're actually a combination of not only and what we were born words to this nature nurture argument but also what happens to us as we 're growing up that 's the key part of the brain wave presentation okay and this is why we 've got this information so up until nineteen ninety than through autopsies in ghastly experiments with people who 've been maimed by accidents so what happened was we could look inside you 're born with 86 million brain cells roughly it 's how they can eat up that 's the important that so the top right is actually a new thing called brain bow and our brain bow can give up to a hundred different brain cells a different color and they can track and see what they 're doing this is the explosion of knowledge that 's given us the information that we present to you and everything that brainwave presents to you is totally scientifically grounded and researched and peer-reviewed so we won 't tell you anything that we 've just decided as a really cool idea everything we give you is really solid right a baby when they 're born the brain is about three to four hundred grams that would fit in my hand it 's similar to a water bomb and consistency that 's why we have to be so careful with babies brains and adult brain is about fourteen hundred grams how big geese hundred 800 800 sexually a thousand oh sorry not for your 21 yards a thousand how big do you think of three-year-olds us somewhere in the middle let me show you so it 's actually not that much smaller than an adult brain as up if you have a look at the person beside you okay and then have it on a three year old 's body see where they fall over all the time okay so when you look at 300 grams 242 and twelve hundred grams and three years and particularly three hundred to a thousand in the first year what it is is that these 886 million brain cells or billion brain cells are talking and making connections so it 's this ridiculous amount of dendritic growth between the cells making connections now is babies and as children the way that works is we take everything in through our senses so when we 're hugged and cuddled and loved we feel good we grow healthy brains okay it actually releases something inside us called oxytocin which helps us grow healthy brains so those connections that we supported and loved and cared for okay if an environment that 's frightening where everything that happens around us is scary we grow a brain that 's consumed and that actually goes back to that survival stuff we don 't have the ability to grow a brain that 's thinking about the world thinking about how we can create things how we can make things you know children 's play it 's really funny we give them one of these different documents and things too in these iPads to play with and we give them created already effects toys the reality is do it is one of the best things you can give a kid it 's got texture you can play with it enticed it if you order this that 's actually how your brain grows your brain grows through experiences via your senses this is really important and when we look at how much our brain grows in those first three years we need to ensure that the experiences that they have that developed it brain are the best ones they can I need a video I 've started doing this how long does it go on for 33 minutes because you 're really within two minutes of Uganda doesn 't so excited oh it 's lovely i get me talk you through this well no no will you do it will ya thank you but she 's got such a great hate school thumb I don 't want to go home tonight I 'm in trouble yesterday I ran in her stead really still kids and teachers were looking for me when they found me teach you how to rage at me she 's always angry principal mental to put it come on through the window so dad 's car driving to the school I took off I waited till it got dark because I thought dad would be out Nina what time now almost home I left the back door open made some baked beans lift some blankets and pillows under the house then waves in the kitchen for you know who does car driving he drove angry and I heard him open the door by angry where are you ugly little mongrel I ran out 't fit under there but he stuck his angry face at the opening and said you made me look like a bloody idiot what are you stupid you 're like a dog hiding into the house you have to come out sometime you 'll get hungry he laughed so I know was really bad this morning when I went in to get my bag he 's asleep on the couch snoring mom 's gone at the moment but she usually comes back mom tries to stick up for me and they fight I running high with the knives I 'm scared that she 'll come home today and he 'll still be angry I heard sirens I thought it was mum and an ambulance it 's my fault mum left I 'm eyes getting in trouble I wish I could be smarter make mom and dad happy it 's never easy to watch that DVD and I think for me as a as a police officer that 's the stuff that I deal with those are the brains that I 've got to deal with those are the brains in and then when we entered at the earthquakes what actually happens with stress with this brains response to stress is that we release a substance called cortisol and we do that fight-or-flight stuff or during the earthquakes we had periods of time where we didn 't know when the next one was we 're in a constant state of alert that 's that 's actually toxic to our brains and the thing that makes stress tolerable is the controllability of it could we control the earthquakes no the debility could we protect them know and the support from others to manage those feelings well the reality was that most children during those earthquakes didn 't have very much adult support to manage their feelings because we were all managing our own we 're all dealing with ourselves and a whole part of other stuff as well so we actually have a generation of children who are coming through who have struggled who have had lots of stress in their lives and if you look up here our brains have this thing called plasticity we grow brains to deal with the you to think about as adults as we need to look after the children these children who are stress these children who are reacting badly who don 't have those coping mechanisms we have accessed through our prefrontal cortex we can calm ourselves down we can manage that in an adult sensible way why overreact to these children this is the stuff I need to get out there this is the stuff I want to share with all of my colleagues with everybody who works with children and I want to help those who are actually in our communities to understand this information we don 't only do early years we also do adolescent years so I 've given you some information I 've given you my card if there 's anything at all that you think you could give me some advice or some help of some assistance as to how I might do this we 're about to plan a project please help 10 feet close Thank You Andrea it was it was great presentation thank you just because you 're being live-streamed and people can access this who 's listening or watching how they actually get in touch with you because they haven 't got your pad the easiest way for them is actually through the brainwave website brainwave have a Facebook page and they have a website if you just Google train way if you 'll find them there 's plenty of information actually on the website and also on the Facebook page it 's very very thorough and those presentations are available to any community that feels like they want yeah absolutely we 're really happy to deliver them okay awesome thank you thank you thank you varies a business thank you very much and Dave um and Matt so the ten minutes is sort of flexible to 12 but but there are only three seats so it 's probably just easier we understand that there are a lot of people if you all want to stand you 're very welcome to do what if you like but you may find it more comfortable for time they might will stand behind me and then just go one after the other that 's why are they mat waters a ho thanks for listening to us this is the presentation from the community formation hope pilot project what we know is that pre-existing community connectors and community infrastructure support resilience make resilient communities the information hub project ran has not been running for about 18 months so far and I 've been asked to run the project by the Allen Area Community Trust is Rachel my manager beside me she 'll be speaking a bit later and one of the things that the four things that we really wanted to do over the second part of the project was increased knowledge and connection with and between members of the neighborhood the neighborhoods that the information hubs are in improve understanding and by neighborhood and community members of the strengths and assets as well as the vulnerabilities within the neighborhood increase awareness by community neighborhood members about how to access the services they need it and support communication specific to neighborhoods we 've had 12 organizations involved they 've each had the opportunity to apply for two grants one was neighborhood planning grant and one was the newsletter the people that are here behind are going to talk a minute each about what they 've been doing with each of those grants and how we 've been working together the information in your packs will supplement what they 're going to speak about and we 're going to try and stay in time so little sins Information Center project we had and it actually began with yourselves with the LT ccp articulating it you wanted to form a community partnership with a little tin timing so we used our neighborhood planning grant through this project to get that process happening so it all started by a series of conversation both with council staff and with our community and one of the first outcomes of this project is up on the slide up there and you 'll see you might know Joan Blatchford on the left is the community governance team leader at littleton Mount Herbert community area they have joined the time bank so together the time bank are exploring ways with Joan and her team and others as to how the time being and the council can the community and Joan group of people that the swimming pool was something that we should focus on you created a brand new pool our community wanted to use it more so with this project we identified that we could have time bank lifeguards so the council has earned time credits for training eight members of our community to be lifeguards and that now they 're all trained and as of this Saturday the pools going to be open for an extra two hours a day by the time bank lifeguards so it 's been a great project thank you got a tow I 'm Robin Arnold and I 'm here to speak for the Sumner vice union trust part of the money was a community put towards a community directory for red cliffs and it 's really important at the moment for us to reconnect with the services that are actually available and currently as things have changed a lot at the last five years also speaking on behalf of the bridge to ox time bank and the timing of this funding was immaculate with the 10-year anniversary of coming and speaking Edgar can the bridge to rocks time bank is in start-up phase in the funding went towards branding and marketing and when you receive funding it 's it 's it 's a journey and that journey for us was really about getting clear about who we are what we are what we look like who our community is the exciting part of that was the engagement and the ownership that our community is taking with their increased professionalism think you Kurian on the direct line of her Mount Pleasant community and we don 't really have time to work on this taught me grip money Christmas fear and we had a community meeting with our street coordinators we 've got a net worth of Street coordinators and out of that meeting came in action which was devised a community directory which I thought was dead boring but anyway because I thought ever sinks on web so why do we need a paper directory anyway I did it soon as that we now I 've got all this feedback coming back so why don 't you put this 't go sort of talk ownership of it so I can see now it 's going to be a great tool what we can do annually and we can even do things like publish your own community plan and um and show the community what we intend to do the next year and it 's just I think it 's a great organizing tool and the other thing I just want to say is this project in itself is fantastic we 're working right across the east and I have to say that we were probably the most affected communities and it 's been awesome to be working together from rich and poor suburbs and I just really want to Community Trust for bringing us all together thank you hello everybody America from the Sumner residents association this project has been unique and has afforded us the opportunity to work with amazing humans in the way of community development we 've used the funding for a newsletter and two brochures and that 's really made a difference we 've had an exciting events held during the neighborhood week and we with local residents in the summer what do they want what do they see for the future of the association and how would they like to see this someplace other in the future so thank you to Erin you in for forwarding us the opportunity by via Jane from South Brighton and we also put together a community directory and the main thrust of what we did however was to get out into our neighborhoods were a reasonably new group so we ran a series of neighborhood becuse that people in our neighborhoods actually hosted themselves and both of their neighbors had three main purposes we and got lots more information about who we are and what we do and also resources for our community out there we got to identify some of the more isolated maybe elderly people in our community that we can then focus our attentions on and the third thing was we got some key people who put their hands up to host those barbecues who are now becoming key people in our community I 'm in terms of working with this group it was fabulous and purposes in terms of implementation and delivery different ways of doing it and we actually know as the people in our communities the best way to deliver challenge to traditional funding wave ways of doing things really like it the second thing is we now have a collective voice we 're all here talking to you whatever strength that comes with it we 're hearing a lot about participation governance and all these kind of words coming around well this is some of the stink that we can build in terms of the community voiced side of the equation so I think it 's brilliant sku I killed everyone I 'm Sylvia from renew Brighton um as you know you bratton 's a super engaged neighborhood with heaps and heaps of things going on eventually identified 170 community so it 's pretty pretty pumping and to keep all of the information in one place and to loot the reasons know what 's going on we 've started a website so it 's called a new brighton online and if you search that you 'll you 'll find it and a designer create this the websites as much about sharing information as it is changing perception of New Brighton is a really diverse and exciting neighborhood so that 's what the restoration was about um yeah so that was what this money contributed towards as well as creating an awesome group of friends really and people supporting each other to do my work good morning Linda Berta confirm social residents association and our funding we looking at what we needed and basically we have nowhere where people can meet we needed to somewhere to set up our tent and talk to our community so use that funding to buy a tent or more to the point a couple of gazebos chairs tables everything that we could set up to make a mobile meeting place anywhere along as streets locality on to the Osprey on to the beach and it 's all mobile we run power cable leads into people 's houses or if necessary we have a generator so there 's also has a dual purpose in that we can run TV computers we can charge up batteries if we can get out to people and that works really well we 've had a range of things perhaps 20 30 people up to just before Christmas we had 90 people gathering where we just set up at ten and out-science so that 's been fantastic it 's on mobile or fit in the back of a station wagon and it 's something that can be borrowed by the other in our group and that 's just been fantastic that we 've got and that support and we we now know so many other groups doing really interesting things and we can share that information and get out to a community hi I 'm Petty and I come from parklands and our project you 've got in front of you on the folder the background to it originally was to have a look at our own suburb where we feel that the whole demographic has changed we 're becoming slowly but surely a suburb of home renters or not homeowners and there was a lot at all the houses are being filled about a lot of people coming into our community they identified where they come from and we felt they were just coming home to watch TV sleep and eat and head off work somewhere else so the idea of the community directory re was to try and get an opportunity to engage for these people and so we did it in a hard copy form and we hand delivered it to people and when we visited if they were home we talked and be at Paxton 's Helen Benny what what their future was the interesting thing about the demographic is we 've just shifted because their house has been knocked down and we 're in a block of five beautiful homes only one of which is owned and the rest of us are renting the school the majority of new entrants in the school last year at parklands were not first year but advanced student second third year that so that 's new people coming in an interesting fact about our community someone thought our library was the pub and had never gone in there and we kept getting us do you have a supermarket and we asked 'd put a picture of some community place we ask the community what would be a picture that would tell you that this is part fence and they said the helicopter park with the kids playing on it well you 've never got problems finding kids playing on our helices back so an answer to the end bill I guess we delivered at the three thousand homes we gave the library a hundred so they could distribute to people who were perhaps coming back in to the suburb they 've now had 308 they 're going out like hotcakes and we 're now starting to realize that a lot of people from outside park guns come and shop there which is good errors and omissions we made for and they were minor we 've had plenty of positive feedback and we 've had six requests for inclusion in the next edition and I guess it 's better to do something imperfectly than to do nothing flawlessly and we 've filled an obvious need thank you very much all right okay so I am oh so we 're now three minutes say I 'm really sorry about this but this is showing some real good no no no no I haven 't interrupted both online but this is our video that we were able to do through some of the funded money and it 's about just showing people the key big mess of projects that are happening and i don 't know--i this year so thank you for letting me show that obviously we 're here for social housing purposes so what we 're trying to do is replace old and poor for new builds and this is one of our sites that we 've got going on at the moment and Aaron early as you can see there 's a plenty of action this is our first site that we 're doing the guy started here properly for five months ago it 's a great design so it doesn 't take long once i get the ground works done they get houses up here so actually adding warm and dry homes the big origin the modern i think they 'll engage with the community they 'll bring the community courage people come in so this site will be completed match 2016 we 've all had teams going in we 've got a better layout we 've got warmer drier homes you 've got a good community complex design so you know it will feel like a community of good like houses together the biggest initiative is the development and the build of the new campus school it 's now called hiatus oh it 's really nice to have a name to put for that because our new school be facing the ease hi atta is the description for the early Rays of the Sun so it 's been consulting with the community working within the school will be a year 12 13 campus which will open n 2017 it will improve the learning opportunities for the community so I think it will offer a style of learning that this has not seen the hue we 're building Becca a new multi-use community center so from some of the tragic consequences of the earthquake we 've seen something positive come out for a de nuit and there will be the next year the sport and physical activity have a number of functions in society they allow participation health and fitness pry allows people from all backgrounds to excel the aranui community have got a strong history of this and it 's our job to work with the community to provide some facilities and to provide some other community infrastructure will be people having your celebrations here with a know you 'll be local community groups coming together it really is a multi-use facility that 's taken on board all of the views of the local community we 've had a really good and pop from all local groups to making sure that what we 're building here makes the needs of everybody both now and into the future we M we think the information hub kind of process it 's got real legs there 's another recommendations that come out of it and some of the key things are we want to continue to meet and we want to continue to formalize involvement with local government and central government and citywide social service providers with this growing information hub network equity and equality of communication from those product from those agencies across our information hub and we want to continue to develop a systematic way that we receive and put out information to our local communities as well as we continue to work together you 're right thank you very much and thank you all of you not just for an excellent presentation but for everything you 're doing in your communities I mean it 's an amazing array of talent that 's standing before us stunning thank you again do you want to do it through the community committee so that you have lots of time for lots of questions because there will be it would be a hundred questions of 5000 points willing to be able to set policy yeah it knows it this was fine if that 's but then on an ongoing basis when you want specific things Andrews committee or I 'm assuming that you already have contests with the Coverity community boards and you 're weird you are locations over a number of areas i think it would be great if we could get Committee i chair that committee and certainly would welcome an initial meeting so that we can get their communication underway right right okay thank you all very much a really interesting presentation that 's them thanks guys we 've got this agenda oh I know yeah and no petitions Eduardo why were

please say aye Isaac carried and then the reserve classification up here would Park is that the one there this is the one that I 've got a little bit of difficulty with ania to abstain from this because the main purpose of the report was to seek a change in the reserve to to change one piece from local purpose to recreation reserve so that they knew well could be drilled to increase the water supply for drinking water and Christchurch but there was no information and the report about anything about the well or the water or whether the resources of there and I 've since received another report from a company that 's done some work on this and the thing is that it it 's flagged and issue to me that the must report which I seem have only bought it last night in its 26 pages now we 've had advice this morning that it 's reasonably urgent because they need to get this water supply pump station by June 2018 but what it is Fred to me from glancing at this reporters I had was that the water testing does not seem to be being done in these deep wells there 50 meters so we have no data some of them are testing just for drinkable standard but they 're not testing for chemical and biological parameters if there 's any objections to this not around this table any public objections that will go to a hearing I have another question that will it go to a hearing regardless so it 's just a nor anyone hear it well bright so when you will the start yet so you can ask anything you want Oh more stuff and cheese mask georgia joy and with this go to a hearing even if there 's no objections so we publicly notified it there was no objections at all to the reclassification so we 're now in the process of just skidding kills because the board approved the reclassification on behalf of doc to change the classification as well there 's no objection so there 's no requirement for anything further in terms of public notification if it goes ahead and well as installed to say that we need a resource can see ya and at that point i think the there 's an issue of stream depletion there are there are three issues over here one is the interference and so on the water quality it has been shown that deeper wells has much better water quality and that 's the purpose of this project because shallow wells we have to go deeper wells so they are about 14 wells in this particular zone which are deeper and they seem to be having good water quality so this is from the desktop study from the data which you have the second issue is on the on the yield now again for the deeper wells it has been shown that the real spill for the deeper wells they have enough there they have about villages per second witches are required amount third one is the interference now we will fires going below 100 meters so we will be looking so the deep aquifers have less action on the service woman is only the shallow wells which are which has more effect but the main part is we are going to drill and we are going to drill an exploratory well first it brother swell to look at the water quality the quantity of water and interference all the suspects first and that 's all is less that 's what we do most of retirement and then we will start drilling the other wells will when we have confirmation on all these three issues and we need the EK n resource approval as well we are going through that process and I 'll must submit that I was quite surprised to see that you have so many wells in that area too and we need more supply our drinking water I 'm just wondering that when i read the fact that the water is not actually being tested for these other things could we maybe suggest or can we can we make a submission to be conceived to the resource which one testing for biological m4m easily unless the water testing for the period biological and chemical parameters and also the reporter collection and reporting back to council on the of that data i 'm sure we 're doing that anyways part of for all that season of course not there 's a lot of not being tested right but that could happen i 'm sure it cooks it is it actually Steve Houston in that area because there was no deep wells in that area no but when we we do a fool for chemical and biological history girls are also each they credit regatta would be testing yes yes i 'm going to say very existing rowers the kiosk razor ongoing what quality governor monthly keeping all the rails for you and it 's council weekend i think the difference made of my CB report was based on a lot of residential private wells and we 're drilling public works so the testing is different for the public compared to rehab they don 't require me the quality that we do so you could actually get that data can I just oh you can ask a question you sure yeah I just want to with what about the depletion issue because that 's clearly a problem especially with things heating up and demands on the water around the city end and widely how is that monitored we do that as part of the groundwater can see it occasionally twin we drill a relatively we test it in every models are all the rails in the local area just to see what Georgiana teeth it was in this particular case is no deep welder than 200 at two and a half kilometers so it 's not expected we need you feat need for the well is because of the increase in demand for water in the region in the area two reasons one is because we have a shallow well which is it doesn 't meet the ministry of health requirements we could replace that well and and also to to cater to the increased demand action so those are the two reasons thank you he thanks for the information I just wanted to make sure and just remember we 're both so happy thank you so you 're okay to move le just okay to seek and Pauline okay so move down a signature poorly and I 'll put those in favor please say aye okay I was carried in can we perhaps these are the 18th November to December and 16 December moved le seconded Pauline I 'll put that those in favor please say aye those opposed re oh do you need to be anywhere for the next 10 minutes _"

want to have moved the entire motion absolutely it 's anything else you want to say on that issue no I mean it 's all there well we 're on I 'm for support and the board was unanimous honest wasn 't it we were yep Jimmy would you like to move there yeah no no I would like to ask her patients first two patients last time the committee meeting on a second of every particular camnipol written recommend when the staff opened Lisa detected a concept design document will attack public then calmly Paul in the start to try to collect and a feedback from the community or individuals as I want to ask up to now whether come here for you also multiple member have received the lost of a peg or not yet I haven 't received any additional feedback yet but the process will allow for us to the shed committee which will work with the community board before any final resolutions on the design and construction are made so there will be opportunities some council the chain to receive feedback through this process this is concept design is secondary succession coming up all the documentation discrete only pointed but the you 're in the epic asian period the one is a care of in safe precinct society the other secretary of the central region resident associate their particular although the victim volunteer library they are cannot afford to provide other services volunteer service in the essential victim area however this car to you know the committee leader formation before the committee for all the council have this kind of decision may need to consult with the community I 'm not sure whether communipaw or council have a consult with name whether least the library service will be continuing in the area due to lay particular concern in the area it 's a high-density urban educated decision whether having consulted with community Thank You Jimmy that was some that was done consultation was done and the statistics if be there will be 141 people who who made submissions in commented 17 only commented on on on libraries and that was more to do with the volunteer library who at the meeting on the second of every we received information that the Rickett and volunteer library was not going to continue in the new facility and then what and that was their choice yeah animation it is like just once a career if I prefer your this equation your separation ask miss you just want to clarify because the particular cancer is a library services rather than the volunteer library service little console the reasoning there wasn 't any feedback that so identified specifically in the very very good consultation process that has taken place up until now for a full-time City Council our library in and the record interior at this stage machine yeah no no that 's three questions now have you got any more questions because the there 's not an issue because I I just want to move you know just one paragraph on the loo motion in the motion I send it to LA whether it 's okay yes they 're the staff consult with the community regarding whether the library service will be continued in a central region area after the closure of the volunteer library base of in response to LA community temptation Jimmy there 's a volunteer library service they are not run by the City Council so if the volunteer library service choose to stay or go that is completely vehicle there is no plan in the budget now or next year or the year after for a library service funded by the council in Central riccarton probably because there 's one an upper riccarton Pendleton central city and a new home plan for hornby so I think this is completely outside of the remit of this this proposal this proposal was a for a community center and the volunteer library have themselves decided that they don 't want to go into this I know this one has a response to the community be patient in a communique look it was not hastily I just want to you know response to our community they have a deputation and I just consult on with the community regarding afterlife the library service will be which library sue this the volunteer lousy service they just mean she said no so is that you Jimmy is it the volunteer library service they didn 't_''_377.71 I think fact really maybe the same scale maybe the yummy I 'm so tell me anything yes what are you saying the staff consult with the community regarding if the library service do you mean that volunteer library service I I don 't sing so is for volunteer life but maybe small scale same size with a current or the volunteer libraries because wider ever closer was volunteer labor 6,000 Wallin books where to go okay they donate to counsel the volunteer library service has been operating and rekha ton since 1928 it 's completely their choice if they choose to continue if they choose to continue then I 'm sure that they would have come along to the community board and you were there and to say we want to continue through cool that they do not want to there is no way that the City Council as either that 's not what our libraries are there places of community gathering data computers all sorts of things you cannot do that in one room so can I just suggest that your motion your proposed amendment is out of order and but I just want to check that Werth in right okay so I 'm not going to accept your for and your amendment in relation to one two and three is it Jesus a masterpiece coming the motion only torches was unanimous at the rickety no good answers my boy Nicky Andrey mmm yeah if I could just make a suggestion I mean the whole nature of volunteer libraries that it requires on it requires volunteers in order for it to run if the community board had a mind to try to keep the Rickett and volunteer library going by working with the community to find more volunteers to essentially take that over or in fact if the written community association had a mind to try and find or provide volunteers to keep that volunteer library going I could see that bin the way in which that would open a conversation about providing a library service in the true sense in the in the council library sense riccarton the right place for that conversation would be as part of the annual planet because it would need to be scoped we need to be budgeted and it would need to be considered alongside everything else we 're planning to do in the library space so I 'm keen to see the voluntary library continue if there 's a desire in the community for that to happen but it does require community volunteers to step up to do that and I just wanted to make that point and they can any states and the concept design and the original concept design did allow for space for the volunteer library should they wish to move there they have since decided that they don 't wish to move there at this point in time but that opportunity was and still is available that the would be space in their area for not solely for the whole time for the volunteer library but when they could move the book shelves away into another at other times when the comment '_''_569.09 when the volunteer library wasn 't open so that that has already been considered with the original concept design before we made the immediately so Mike this is the recommendation from the community board was a unanimous decision recommend Oh Jimmy do you want to move it I don 't want them ok Elmo birds and um Rachel second it yep yani if we could I mean the point that Andrew made before council turn about I agree about that the provision of library source is really a matter for the activity management plans we will bontempi my own or through the annual plan process so just I think maybe a better solution is just to have a note that any similar that 's concerned about the loss of library services the appropriate process for them to make submissions as into that process to the annual camp ND annual question so it was mentioned by one submitter I 'm sure that my could pass that on to them okay um an Indian thing I just wanted to just che um I 'm still being with it so you got an existing the successful business that 's working well and we 're gonna not let over build a new facility and we 're going to sell off the land with a current facility is why wouldn 't you do it the other way around why wouldn 't you sell off the place with a businesses so that could possibly that business one except for example Robbie 's bar yeah and build the community center on with a current community interests so you actually get a 1-1 rather than getting rid of a lot business the local businesses leashes some expired so any the council 's made that decision yes the council 's made this decision what we 're now discussing is the concept design basically where it goes and basically the size and those sorts of things you would notice also that the community center asked could be built so that a second story could go on if there was a lot of need this is not a detailed design drawings this is a concept design finally a new community center in representing which 'll see extensive consultation was done with the community family even standing in wrexham all asking people what they wanted and it 's an interesting community very high rental population around there very I young population around there and a lot of what they wanted was things like computer gaming which are quite different then then perhaps we owe it 's really expensive yeah sorry about that okay but that decision around the lane has already been made yes as I understand it sometime ago yeah I just said that post-earthquake it was a lot of consultation on whether the existing community center should be or could be rebuilt and then what people would like in a new community center should one be built in location so that took place with a special consultative process post-earthquake and then we 've moved on from there with the preferred location which is the rubbish site and we 're just takin it from there ok so I 'm going to I 'm moving and rafa seconding these recommendations I 'll put those those volume overload to defeat yeah yeah I 'm where we concept design document because in the early stage in the beginning the committee ball in a community request a start consider based on outer nature experience easy to say trailer the concept is an argument in a public one and also the commercial sensitive argument in PX 1 however the stuff that didn 't listen to the community in a community or arbitrary so 2 times X and also for the Hermit EP empty paper please and also and also the face on the email man destined amazement labor you know at the end of november last year in the Tula the secret over central region Restaurant Association and also CC to communal in local councillor to only po neeta i would like to not emphasize particular mention moving forward part of decision making process were being involved in in the community poll particularly at a concept design stage and this will allow for further input however didn 't make enough parties second is your amines are secretive of Restaurant Association specific pointer will be carried into the concept design but you are where this document is in a PS context and also the owner a second of febrile reader are common upon meeting all the poor member with the chairperson here as clearly and we listen to wonder chair of things f precinct association the oven secretary of the central region restaurant associates on behalf of their community association particular highlighter you know p the after the closure of the victim the volunteer library whether in this area have a handle of the library service need to consult with the community first rather than just make a decision directory so i under the poly pointer here nature is a powerful response to LA community like another pulley in here this is my particular concept maybe not has to be you know to continue leather library service in the central region area however we need to take into account we need to hear the voices from the community that 's the attitude so and also if you review the page 206 you can see the HR alert service center you know in the half a year they have a 6830 night transection if we compare with some other the learner thick of windows and parul even more than those dollars service center so this high demand in data area so I 'm disappointed you know this one I still accepted a committee for the recommendation disappointed because my recommendation when paper not going in there yes okay just just so we 're clear the record and community board is suggesting that the silver Center remain in the record and commercial area having looked at those figures edits last meeting correct at the last meeting the stuff that was in DX was made public and those groups who wanted to address the record and community board address the Riccarton community board as a result this is all coming in public with some slightly different decisions then that 's slightly different recommendations than what might have been there before it also the volunteer every fronted up to the community board and spoke to the community board and see if they did not want to continue past the change they 're called entirely so I think actually the exciting thing is that we now have a concept design for a new rocket and been closed for what five years yes it is it 's got a tiny bit at the front which is usable and the entire back of it is completely unusable when dead about duty three fifteen percent or something fifteen percent of building code not useful this is a modern usable very flexible 549 square meters from it from memory space that is there for the community of riccarton which will be staffed and which will have potentially a service center in it depending on where is the best place with a service center so I think actually a brilliant outcome but what I 'd like to do now and is put the motion which I 've moved and Retta seconded but those in favor please say aye aye those opposed carried thank you and and the next one is the 24 and 25 anything you want to wear to those lines just minutes just might give the next year and this is any questions and have you move you 're happy to move those Jenny moves Andruw seconds put those those in favor please say aye aye those opposed much indeed mike and the PX punj will be taken impeach later in the minute meeting today just as a matter of commercial st. dealt with anyway okay thank you very much you doing that to date night okay

    "text": "rotation that the community action and what the community are also really happy to support the resolutions are input okay all good right okay i 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye as opposed say no that 's Carrie I 'm item 33 changes to committees I 'd like to amend this by adding an a third which is amending the terms of reference for the insurance subcommittee to to consider the cost sharing agreement with government and light of the global settlement of the insurance and make recommendations back to Council and seconded by Jamie so there are three items on here so I 'm happy to move the the resolution and the Jamie 's second third so there are three components to it one as the district plan review committee which if you could delete a Lee Jones from the list of ones i was quite keen to have people across the different wards and Pauline 's put a name up so I 'm is you could you can think Pauline for this in a tile ideas but yesterday we write and and it 's 're doing is has changed obviously with things in the hands of the independent hearings panel and a more focused group with the ability to come back to Council if we need to as I think a much better idea but it doesn 't stop counselors from tuning up to the meetings that 's just and those are the those are the members of the of the committee and amending the terms of reference for the orden de risk management committee that was to provide for the independent members of the audit and risk manager committee to review the draft long-term and annual plans to identify any risks that that may be present and and that 's the function of the audit and risk management committee but given their counselors are on those committees their committee it made sense to make that a function purely of the independent members and that way you 've got the you 've got fresh eyes secret from the council itself putting their eye over the annual plans the long-term plans just to identify those areas of risk and then the insurance subcommittee its workers up yet but just to now reflect on the cost sharing agreement I think I 'll never forget when we sat in this room you know sort of locked doors and the lawyers at the end of it as we were disclosed a copy of the cost sharing agreement for the very first time as brand new council as having just been elected and the feedback was sitting over the side and I 'll never forget it because it 's etched in my memory but here reading out the claws that said that our commitment to the two to the provisions of the or our contribution to the different projects and was regardless of what we got by way of insurance recoveries and she shall remember who reading it out and saying does this mean what it sounds like it means and there was this silence across the room as we all reflected on what that mean for the city so I think it 's important that the insurance subcommittee reflects on the cost share agreement with government and light of the global insurance settlement and reports back with recommendations right right yeah no yeah I 'm just no on the district plan there 's no representation from Finn alton y mari so I mean it does seem if you wanted to get a view across the city and I actually think given that the discipline does affect the entire city it isn 't JD was a former chairman it has to be naturally emerging choice jessica Lee I actually think the one thing that you haven 't got on me but was agreed is that we 're actually have a summary of what 's going on yeah oh jeez no we 're doing no no exact know we got a summary we got a very short summary I 'm done with a week 's notice there 's a lot as long as things done but that 's the next thing that we want to do is to actually have a complete summary of everything that we 've got two and we 're we 're what else needs to be done and the other thing I like with any committee as well um passionate but I 'm gonna put you but because the whole thing and the V based thing as well this is I seriously need to make sure that you 're doing a good job of everything and yeah how smooth marriage where 's will step aside 05 management there 's an invasion prior they did no no take my priority is I 'm accounts caring well I 'm a counselor first and foremost and they need be able to do a job so with this no one 's precluded from being your uh no no no I want dynamo rare for it there 's a good how sweet and s there is so if there is something only that directly affects our ward we can 't_''_347.02 be there and we can contribute to it no your honor you by the brain maybe Carly refugees chair of the committee doesn 't want to be honored cuz can 't_''_365.139 see the point but the point is that I think also a night I don 't know I think you don 't want a resolution but i think that committee needs to review its terms of reference yeah and be I think it 's just it 's been a huge frustration and the window report has shown that yeah and we need to actually think more strategically about how we 're using yeah I district lender to the outcomes for US citizen it 's not just responding to what the wants us to do so you know I 'm happy to remain on it on that basis yeah but I do think it 's important that it has wide representation because it will be making yeah no no and refs agreed to come on it so that 's good I mean there are some some wards of want to have both honor and that 's fine as well oh I have what 's number two was her what I mean I support the concept of it I 'm worried about the cost of it and the process of it in terms of the independent members review of their annual plan of the long they 're doing it now the thing is is that we made a decision last time late in the prickly peace during the long term plan update reference at the moment was required to check their annual plans in the long-term plan and it was a process that was very unsatisfactory because the proper process is for that is really and this is what this does is make it crystal clear that there is a role but it 's the independent members who play that role great can I just say it 's only looking at the risks they 're not getting through the hole oh the rest take Mexico needs to save it because that 's what i said when i introduced and they 're not commenting on what would an Iranian review of the risks imposed by of the risks in relation to the draft risks to the council would tomorrow you can say in relation to the risk management plan or yes oh just say review of the plans in relation to the risk management framework okay no they 're not they 're just gonna be a fool yeah in relation to the recent management framework yeah that 's good just in terms of the process or the mystery plan committee just taking yannis of reference to do we need to have a council notional resolution because we 're going to connect we 're here to come back to count _"

the agenda is the B base the most appointment of new jury or stupid but ye used it fit and the well you don 't need to the question god don 't know because you 've resides it so um I think that with the the recommendation here is is slightly different from what we would normally do simply because we we have an election later this year and just for the sake of continuity in the meantime we can view this after the all those that are here can the new council can incoming council can review that so i will move that motion seconded by thomas kendra are you allowed to add to vote on probably not no this is the silliness yes Andrews Tina not a member of it no clue the phone I will put their motion or put this in favor say aye like I the table directly similar the board directors obvious you know Paul and Paul to nickel yourself booty yes oh boy absolute that Jenny dritt resign well past okay oh whatever oh the rig just stood back from the decision-making and report by the council by the chairperson of the capital endowment fund working group councillor Paul lonsdale yes look this was an interesting piece of work obviously it was the outcome was quite different to the staff recommendation and I suppose and one hand you can understand the staff recommendation with our current wiring and future borrowing that we 're going to need to do but I think the reason we came to the decision as we wanted to keep the spirit of what nurse endowment fund was there for and once it 's removed that you know you can 't go back from there so we looked at it we thought we we need to make this a talent fun actually work a lot harder currently as sort of this way of breaking even we different rules little bits and pieces so I am pleased to see that the of the recommendations and B which is the environment so I 'm happy to see that but I would also like to put a 3 a and that 's the recommendation about we just add the weeds in the bed of the woods Bob have you mind read yeah fantastically awesome so with those out of red side I 'd like to say I hope the council supports us here the Kevin I 'm Dylan I 'm working room all work quite hard and I think if we put down rather than by the 31st of March or earlier no sis by like so you 'd say that um yeah well you 'd like to move there I 'll sit with someone like to second date okay well I just like to say congratulations and I 'm really appreciative all of the work that you 've done on this and I 'm glad that you 've decided that it 's a good idea to actually up the ante on the you know potential for getting a better rate of return on it so I really appreciate that I think I working group and I was pleased to be a part of it I 'm particularly pleased with the recommendation that the fund be retained what this piece of work does actually what this recommendation does it allows greater flexibility in the way that the fund is able to be applied and with the next piece of work it will also hopefully allow for greater flexibility in the way that 's invested so that we get better outcomes we did originally have a paper which had a different set of recommendations and as a result of a deputation someone coming to talk to us that put some other alternatives forward which it was great to be able to discuss those I 'd also like to acknowledge the input of the external members of the working group that certainly were able to add some input into the discussion a really lively and full discussion I 've got to sign on please it 's landed where it has and very happy to support it all right Yanni dune buggy oh yeah um yeah I term really happy to support this um just to submission to the annual plan asking for the endowment fund to be split into quarters to address community social environment and economic so it 's taken time I can 't that 's okay we 're getting there which is good so I 'm the reason I did that then and the reason I support this now is that when you go back why this fund was set up in the consultation that occurred you know the council I guess was faced with several options one option would have been just to simply give everyone a a payment like some of the council 's have done around New Zealand so every citizen would have got a right to rebate or a contribution but but the idea was that you create this fund that could go and do good and for the for the purpose of the study and for citizens and the interesting thing was the initial consultation overwhelming the people or more people supported this fun being used for community and civic projects rather than the economic however council actually made a different call and then when 7030 split which economic even the community and civic components generally went into economic sorts of events activities and it was very hard for the community and the Civic component to actually be recognized so I think this is really good I think this is overdue but I think actually it 's a fear of _"

    "text": "hey David East I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye aye there 's a cosine oh that 's carried now we move to options for the treatment of asbestos-containing material at qe2 we have Andrea coming who 's the chair of the biggest fear with Pegasus community board who has a recommendation has asked that this come forward to the 28th of January meeting so thank you for coming and Andrea yep I 'm only thank you everybody it 's great to finally get to this point we know a bit two more coming but acting very long coming it 's one of my questions yes it 's not for you to answer I don 't know so just a couple of things perhaps just raise the board note 10.1 that it was important to XD communication with all affected stakeholders we know that a word can elicit some responses we want to be clear that the board want to be part of any communications that go out and with us that in part four of our recommendation we had a near miss just before Christmas was some very poorly chosen words that could have backed by quite big time so that at the border quite done sort of sensitive to being involved just to avoid any mishaps the other thing is that the the board have also put in part 1 we 've added we resolved this business containing material found and the qe2 demolition site is safely and fully encapsulated so we made the resolution that we wanted to have it fully so that includes being having linings but underneath the pile just to allay any fears and give the community greater confidence and what we are proposing very good right um questions so i pulled my question is what what what what took so long I mean the letter went out to went out to residents on their 20th of december two thousand eight so it 's just over two years ago updating on the qe2 part on site so people have known about that since then so why has it taken two years to bring this to us obviously Sierra 's had some issues in terms of the contractor around demolition but for the length of time as you 've said Madame mayor I started with some issues that but Sarah were having they are they following that a exercise was undertaken to explore all the possible alternatives for the treatment of asbestos the getting it right was a key key outcome the we got a report from Sarah and quite frankly when our council officers reviewed it they wanted a second opinion so we engaged Becker consultants and God yes and similar information but different information on the costs the at that point in time I think it 's fair to say that there are a number of conversations going on with the Ministry of Education and their use of the land and it was a let 's say feedback from those conversations at that particular time that the decision-making on asbestos not be run at concurrently I could those discussions with the ministry reach a certain point in time before the asbestos remediation process was sped up we are are we we did that once we reached a point with the the ministry where discussions had reached fruition are we funding are reviewed the reports peer reviewed them in-house and presented the board with a recommendation before Christmas it 's our desire obviously to seek out direction with the council and get straight into it because we do think this has taken too long Pauline yep dumb question but just I thought asbestos was only dangerous when it was airborne so why therefore can we not just leave it buried under the sports field it 's a great question and that 's exactly what this option proposes to do counselor right at the moment the asbestos is in layman 's terms it 's in a number of heaps all over the place it is above ground but it is being covered by a a very temporary layer it 's not dangerous but it 's unsightly and the temporary measures fail from time to time what this report proposes to do is to is to bury it in set buns fully enclose them make them completely safe and use those buns as a low level rise embankment for a sports field anything of course the information will be noted absolutely them what 's called a hail site so any any disruption in the future will be very mindful that there is as best as containing material in the ground thank you Andrew Jimmy thank you um I note the cost advantages and the timing advantages of option one yeah but presumably in as much as option one involves minimal disturbance of the asbestos where it is at the moment there 's an advantage to auction one or perhaps of disadvantage to option 2 of x movingly asbestos and hauling it there 's a greater chance that particles could become airborne in that process than there are in the option one process now I just wanted to check the you know despite best endeavours whoever 's doing the work there is a greater chance of particles becoming airborne under option to than they would under option one that 's the professional advice we 've received from becca sarah and earlier on Tonkin and Taylor you 're absolutely right thank you okay yeah my question is regarding to the second a bully pointer of a disadvantage because you hear you can you imagine material if in the future this place this site should we go into the redevelop but just postponed is the future costco and I 'm not sure part of probability of possibility for on-site we 're busy need develop yeah counselor chain one of the one of the reasons that this report has taken a little longer than expected is we took some time to identify I place on Kure to park which would have the absolute least chance of being disrupted in the future however if things change and in a number of years we were going to move this again we would know exactly where it is exactly what we were moving and put a planning on to how to do it cost effectively and safely the advantage here is will know exactly what 's under the ground we won 't be digging and discovering and hoping thank you thank you Yanni Kelly yeah just several questions I was just interested and I say that Sarah had formerly closed out the demolition contract yes and the original demolition contract what was provision made for the removal of assistance of the contract but they contract with Sarah identified that there was asbestos-containing material on site and the asbestos-containing material would be are removed and dealt with in a in a safe manner the the issue is that this was I discovered in a place where it wasn 't envisaged are dug up they and we are where we are I just I just I just don 't quite understand how someone can get a contract to do something and then basically what I know Maine 's Hill had problems so they walked off the job or they go they finish but Sarah was doing the demolition they had a contract to do certain things do we need to pay for their it feels like we 're paying did we pay for the cartridge we wear yeah we pay for the we pay for the services of Sarah to demolish the up the contract essentially follows okay demolish the contract excuse me oh yes relax to monster it is too bad we we have to counsel pay for Sarah to demolish the facility the council said to Sarah you will 're there and they 're under the provisions of the contract they dealt with it and dealt with it successfully and we paid them for it this asbestos was found in a place where we didn 't know it was and we didn 't tell Sarah it was so it 's not Sarah 's responsibility or deal with it thank you so what happened to the previous assist us the previous asbestos I can 't actually answer that question I 'd have to go back to Sarah and ask them how they are disposed of it they did dispose I did despise we 're satisfied that it 's been disposed of yes we are right yes oh this is newest bestest that wasn 't covered by the contract we didn 't highlight I was just interested in understanding the cost of them doing their original dispersal and how that compares to this these options we we haven 't_''_627.94 we have a look to that they I mean serah 's costs for that would go back a number of years they engage mainzeal they won 't bust they got say Smith convoluted process looking into we didn 't do it because we didn 't feel it was particularly relevant but we can be reassured that it 's been disposed of properly and professionally and it 's not something somewhere else I couldn 't comment on that whatsoever it 's certainly not on qe2 that we know about so I I can 't comment on Sierra 's disposal pros solve you know how they run their demolition is but this is a contract we had with them so for this contract that we 're going to all the option that we 're going to go to how can we be reassured that everything it gets see that 's going to be done gets done properly given that we have found a number of sites yep that you know where demolitions ever code now where this does is bi found despite yeah people being aware of it as certainly this this will now go to they are counseled city services group and they will set up the contracts to deal with us and they will get insurance within the contracts that it will firstly from Sarah then peer reviewed by Becker 's on exactly how we 're going to do with this and it 's the responsibility of the contract manager are to specify the contract and to audit that every stage has been done so the this is our issue and we have to have confidence that our city services team will do this very well I 'm Ellie thank you page 126 John where it talks about the budgets and costs could you just explain what the capital governance pooler 's and also just go through some of those costs and confirm that you know we have the money and it 's not going to cause problems with what we 've already budgeted for yeah the the capital governance pool was or is a mechanism to allow a project where but have exceeded budgets and it 's anticipated that will happen to be topped up it requires a decision by the council 's executive to do that the it was set up a number of years ago it 's a contingency it 's a contingency yep specifically designed for this purpose scrutinized this and we are happy for these funds to be applied the second part of the funding is councils building an infrastructure allowance which was a fun specifically set up by counsel for our infrastructure and repair projects they so the application of these two funds together which are sitting in budgets at the moment will not result in any extra or unplanned overall expense to council will be used the I guess the only financial risk is if the cost of the work is substantially more than what is expected a that there may be either a review of the scope of the job or a report back through the executive team to counsel on that potentially an issue we don 't believe so they and we sought advice on this the the initial cost on a recommendation by Sarah on disposing of this asbestos has been are increased quite considerably following a peer for you peer review from Becker 's and following a third peer review by staff so we think we 've heard very much on the side of caution and don 't expect at all all steps to reduce the cost of this I 'm hopefully return a little bit of that contingency to the fund just finally what does that do to them amounts left in those two funds all those two are just about bottoms them abortion is low yes there does what would just do you want to want to run through the capital governance holguin what it does yet the the the the capital governance pull was a fondue Dave Joseph yeah would you like to yeah it 's not for you to sit up with all the VIU projects all the business as usual projects they needed a two percent of their so none of the facilities and infrastructure we build stuff was done so to person the businesses usual capital program we need to a government school to pay four overs and unders and so they 've been traditionally but a part of think it actually pulled out of around about 2 million this has been going on for many years my understanding so as Jon says some this one came along we believe it 's essential work that put it all into one project as John said because it does basically quite about that all for the rest of the year and we 're only halfway through it at this point in time but this piece of work has 2k and we didn 't see any other way of funding us so that 's really what they 're always to see little it 's really mean for a little over stand happy on little jobs rather than a big bonus but we believe this but it wasn 't an allocation per project it 's an allocation on a budget yeah based on BAU projects based on we build project in the other fund the building infrastructure was that the original carpe diem fund the building and infrastructure allowance was that the original carpe diem fund that we 've been we renamed it the improvement funding that 's been renamed I 'm unaware of our carpe diem it is so it was the one they set up after the youth quakes for any opportunities of improvements which said outside the project so to use it when it was opportunity that fund it takes it to a very very low level they that 's my understanding Pauline yes David get Peter Lane by and down he would know what sniffed in those furious pulls it was set up originally he would I understand it is getting if it 's not I think it 's about attitude I could say that the number three that the capital governance call it seems inappropriate use but building an m4 structural answers probably not but you know I mean I we 're at where its allocated from is probably at this point neither here or near the neither here nor there because it 's all borrowed anyway so yeah um yeah oh sorry I was just going to just check that obviously we 're going through the insurance settlement so that would just be part of the cost of guilt or not we would have made provision surely for demolition cost was there like global settlement on insurance so no that 's animation so so the infrastructure allowance going to be topped up from insurance as it came in on a case by case doesn 't it 's not as relevant all right so you 're talking about more topping up the fans again topping up I don 't know it 's a separate I sure we can we can discuss there I mean we have to review our entire oh not not our entire but we had to review things and light of the insurance only one anyway I was trauma is this another project that we 've taken out of that bidam building an infrastructure allowance ahead of any settlement with the insurance that will be topped up once we finalize that not necessarily we have to we 're going to have to make a decision separately on that matter I 'm not going to make that decision today alright so do i hear a health got a mover in a second day by david glenn so i 'll put that motion Oh discussion David look I just like to support this motion and really state that it 's an issue that 's created quite some concern amongst the community surrounding qe2 particularly we have these large mounds that have had cover fail I think it 's pertinent to note that the the asbestos that as under scrutiny here principally comes from water pipes their arse business water pipes the actual level of risk for them from them is quite low and they are only a risk to to society win the asbestos has crushed and it becomes airborne so the potential for a wide spread asbestos epidemic if you like in the area is quite low and I 'm really confident that this is the best solution that we can come to for the disposal of the asbestos in this area and our community board were at pains to stipulate that the the encapsulation process had to be full in an entire and I think long term that 's the best solution we can we can come to the alternative was to load it all up that have to being packaged for transportation to Kate Valley and the cost to do that was somewhere in the order of 12 million dollars so I 'd like to encourage counselors to support this resolution it 's something that has been of some irritation and deal with this issue the better and move forward with the redevelopment of QE to pack for sport and education proceeds as the better thank you excellent yeah oh yeah thank you um I have a different view and I think there 's some questions we need we really need to get some answers to I mean I think we need to know what 's happened to the original asbestos material from qe2 and we need to actually understand how that was disposed of them for me actually the cost of the higher cost of disposing of it properly and in a way where we know where it 's gone now I think outweighs the cheaper option today and my reasons for thinking that up our that over time we 're going to have to have a huge monitoring regime around this encapsulation and you know as things do great over time we 're going to have just simply have to pay more and more money so I just think actually doing it doing it once and doing it properly to an area that 's dedicated for taking s we are simply passing this problem on to a future generation of future council to deal with in time when we 've actually got the opportunity to dispose of it in a more final since at Kate Valley I I think it 's interesting that these are going to be sports fields and we 're going to have schools on site we 're going to have high use of activity in this area and although the risk may be may be small as it 's been said actually I don 't think it 's with leaving that risk residual risk hanging around for a long time when you can actually spend some more money now and actually dispose of it properly but I think this calls into question the wider issue of how we 're dealing with asbestos in the city particularly around how we 're going to fund for it and you know I think of the current Lancaster park for example and maybe other places like Centennial pool or other public facilities that we have and what the consistent approaches and maybe we need to get just a a holistic strategy is because it may be that there 's some cost efficiencies and it may be that you know we do actually have to think about the funding aspect of it rather than doing it on a case-by-case basis but I definitely support dealing with the issue not leaving it hanging around but I i I 've my preference would be for option two so I 'm not going to support um clean thank you some of the key people involved in this also include the surrounding residents associations of a sport and parklands in particular the chair or just recently former chair petty Brandon of Parkins is happy with the community boards recommendation and what the community the residents associations want is just is ongoing communication openness and transparency with them it is happy that the this option is preceded with he has some contact with medical experts who say yes it 's fine to proceed with it in this manner all he wants an exchange is openness over how it 's dealt with so I think as long as we have our local kind of host a sensible decision excellent our fill I think this is a very important issue I guess to me around the risk and the best way of dealing with it I take comfort from what dr. Alistair Humphrey medical officer of Health for Canterbury States and it 's clear in the report undisturbed asbestos in the ground does not cause harm and here 's satisfied that the way it 's being _"

    "text": "on to item number and lehmann which stealin smart city program funding paper I might actually say something in this one yes you may please introduce the paper angel fellow presented so I 'd like to introduce Hayden read he 's the luns program director but Hayden is also the extra TG asset manager from Wellington City Council and I 'd also like to introduce to reason become who is the program manager for smart cities under the commit work stream of grateful Christchurch so what we 're asking for here is basically approve the match funding of three hundred and thirty thousand dollars for the long-term plan sensing from the long long term plan sensing city budget to support the lens program of Christchurch proof-of-concept projects the thirty three hundred and thirty thousand dollars in funding from Lunds and two hundred thousand dollars from unity as contributions toward Christchurch smart set program and authorize the mere to sign the smart city collaboration protocol protocol with in ec now basically this is for a proof of concept over a defined period and the end of that proof of concept is smart cities so what I 'll do is I 'll quickly pass over to Theresa to give a book but a background of what the lun smart city program is about ok so the Lin 's smart city program is really having a one view between Auckland Wellington and Christchurch it allows us to trial senses and ways of working with our other agencies and ultimately the business case will be a deliverable there that will be going towards the concept of a smart nation sure sure I just I guess there 's an opportunity we knew Zealand where only a little place really have some geospatial challenges of course but it makes a lot of sense with some of the new technologies and approaching these things to take a bit more of a global view so what we do in one place should be able to be replicated particular in the public sector space seamlessly into into another space so the whole idea of this innovation project is really to look at whether you might approach the new technologies around help helping run cities and when we do that our learnings across the cities and in the future in the towns across New Zealand in the real space at what is ultimately least cost and this benefit it 's a public value question so this is what this is about is exploring that the technologies do they work how do we do that how do we have we work together and ultimately how do we provide what we all want to provide is safe livable enjoyable community spaces I think that I 'm one of the things that came up in the paper for me was that the topics of interest that were identified in a workshop last year so in three point 14 it talks about improving understanding to improve decision-making improving analytics to improve decision-making improving engagement to create create the bright outcomes and talks about interactive opportunities and participative democracy and catalyzing economic development opportunities as well and it seems to me that because I 've looked at the london city website and they have a dashboard where anyone in london can go online and just see what 's happening with traffic movements with equality with Beijing at one so you know it 's got all of those things that you can you actually can know about what 's going on in your city and what to avoid and what not to avoid and I kind of think that their theorem there must be enormous opportunities for us as a city as we rebuild to embed some of this technology which is why we put money on budget in the first place for their sensing city projects so in terms of where the money comes from out of the budget I think you 've targeted the right spot but to collaborate with wellington and auckland in order to get the best bang for bucks for new zealand inc i think it really works for me on another level as well No ok well it wasn 't meant to be a question time Ellie just thinking of a practical application of something that 's happened in the last 12 hours so the amount of rain that 's fallen for example and on facebook and networks last night people in our ward were talking about whether there was there a potential for people to go online who live in that area to see if the pumps are going and if there 's flooding is absolutely is Yanni pulling the key yeah thank you I mean this is basic to enable us to have more information but I still don 't quite see how it actually changes the decision-making around dealing us on the issues so if you took a very topical issue which would be the particular and most informal which are you know it had historically been at very high levels or the air quality or the water quality even when we have huge number of complaints and lots of evidence that shows as a problem we still don 't actually get any solutions so what what 's the difference unless in terms of finding solution howlett and I lost fun better solutions or actual solutions to the problems so I think the fact that as lien spoke to with the very visible dashboard we start to engage in a way that 's very meaningful both to the public and to councillors and to the executive members as simple as seeing how certain things happening announce that he impact on the particular level not only can we say there is a problem but we can say we can start to see what is impacting or what is causing that problem so we start to see trends and whatever it might be mutual fact as it might be cloud suit and cloud and you know certain cloud patterns create more of a particular problem it could be I mean I don 't know I 'm just wouldn 't wonder yeah right yeah and and so once you know these sorts of things are happening you can start to say this is a problem so as a member of the public unless I have a technical understanding of the science I may not understand what the issue is with the particulars but if I can see it in a very meaningful easy simple way I could probably give you a bit more of a bricks-and-mortar ii answer if you like some guy is it so some folk overseas are tracking vehicles through these kind of technologies for the first you have incidences of events on the network planned or unplanned application software can inform motorists literally at their dashboards around routes to take decisions of whether they 're going to jump on a train or jump in the car or even walk in certain circumstances so the cities are actually able to function and respond in the folk inner cities music obviously make up the cities can make real-time decisions with information that is in front of them otherwise you can 't see any barrier between this work and they can consenting so that when people get consent with conditions or when we think about granting certainly do activities it 's tied into information that it against an effect because that 's been one of the challenges with the community is that you know the tests have always been so high and we 've got this issue I 've been obviously living know them in wrong way we 've put electronic monitoring and but it still hasn 't really satisfied um the concern so we haven 't looked at that specifically again we 're asking for funding to start it if there are monitoring systems in place that 's put in place through this project this program in years they can link into the enforcement side of things for resource consents in and ii remittance for example so ye stick it can be linked to it to answer your first question Yanni and you know with information that we can gather from these types of sensors ah I can 't I can 't sit there and say this would be the solution to allston but I think it holds us accountable yep because the information is much much more open and public we 're not we 're not debating it behind closed doors it could be it could be available on a date and a dashboard like we said we would become much more accountable to come up with a solution as governors in his executives and it 's the council but this would be open source data so others would be encouraged to come up with solutions as well that 's right and what I 've seen overseas is that you know young smart people who know how even do they they create apps that people you know will both buy online you know so they create a little business opportunity out of you know every dose data yeah that 's right I 'm Pauline okee Glynn oh thank you mom just a question of what to exceed just around the timelines you 've got your open source your concept period which will end at the end of 2016 so during that time I assume you 've got some trials up and running this so after this dheemahi whatsapp it so the process is to develop that strategy going forward for the city before the pilot or before the proof-of-concept pushes and there is something strategy is something that will be approved by council and we 'll have a governance um governance process around it as well right in my second and I 'm particularly interested and the idea of being able to get some information about our water quality what level of detail would we expect about the different types of pollutions quite a lot of work has been done in areas like the land of water the cities in the background with regional councils in a few places are looking at measuring all of those elements that we hold near and dear things like e.coli heavy metals and a whole raft of other ones the technology is actually right here it 's about how you constructively build a monitoring an environment that allows you to inform what you want to know and relax regards to the regards to the particular um water body or asset that you 're trying to trying to understand so it 's really about crafting what specific for the specific purpose or what will happen in Wellington going to the beaches might be slightly different for the streams around christchurch but ultimately you get to make those sorts of decisions when you come to decide what specific outcomes you want for whatever it 's great Thank You Bucky we can get amazing data very quickly it creates so what I 'm intrigued by and what I 've got being pressured by in the discussion the other day was that this was going to actually result of things happening this or the phone leveraging off strategies that are already existing and wellington and auckland hayden how to develop it so two weeks was it really that scary on three point 17 it talks about testing building technologies built form fearful pedestrian interactions as well as streetscape and eggs he can have also expressed an interest in using the infrastructure to pursue joint projects on water quality I mean this is real you know it 's real started that will make a difference into the city and in as soon as we can get this approved if you prove it we will appreciate pressure we will actually start and earnestly talking with he can about funding in what they can do in the spaces excellent excellent you can clean clean indeed Paul I saw what thank you you can move it you 're sick of it thank you just a few times here so with this information here will it enable us to for instance anticipate win the next what a main might burst and very Avenue or will it show me a better way through the labyrinth of roadworks and can it give it do to the Kennedy another geese so booing on the pontoons a clear breach so really tell me please how it will actually add value okay to all of us to be a ratepayer dollar can I give an example of it is already hitting in Wellington and in the set of gutter and to give to 22 um in Cuba more they have installed I 've got what they call a living lab and they have audio sensor as well as a visual camera sensor and the audio sensor has been has learned the total broken glass and screaming and they have an agreement with the other agencies police emergency services agencies for homeless people and things like that and to be able to respond when they have an event started to happen and they also have shape recognition where they can the camera now can identify what appears to be a bigger and when they see someone interacting with that bigger they confirmed that it is a bigger and then they can have once again agencies going and looking at that vulnerable person and helping them and and and it means that we are now anticipating things that are happening in our city so if we think about our riccarton bus exchange and our central bus exchange we 've got an ability now to start to intervene in events as they begin to occur rather than after they have occurred which makes it a much safer environment just a severe mean free it 's a machine I 've heard some examples around upping and downing lighting and making a call making it warm you know like depending on what 's going on in the environment wrong yeah if you want peace recipes it 's like a nightclub at three that 's right I recall from the old you know they turn the lights on for everyone will go home you can do that by sensing technology as well yeah just just replied it 's gone up here when you 've talked about those who are homeless or begging so confirm who is a bigger I mean someone could be busking sitting on the grip you cannot you here we go no it would that they actually trained identify the difference Oh cute our technology is seriously it 's free just an exact example when they first started and they had a success rate of one out of every 50 events were successfully identified as a big event in three weeks time the software was able to identify a hundred percent as big events this is the sort of learning that we 're talking about in the software you just need to take time have smart people on the case which we have got and the software will respond as we need it to begging events homeless events we 're reducing subjects to objects I mean this is a service yeah it 's just an example just to example it wasn 't an example because I mean what they were saying was that in terms of intervening with somebody who 's clearly in a vulnerable situation oh it 's great that 's that 's that 's a positive that 's not a negative famous and it 's not about going in you know having someone arrest it 's about having something from a social agency going to check with Wellington City Council they have a stakeholder group of what was it Hayden a hundred and nothing home five on stakeholder groups including groups like ones and those type of social agencies so we 're that occurs they can involve those types of agencies to help these people we will put people in the categories no it 'll identifies people who have big angle homers well that 's that 's why i use the lighting one as an example you can also use it for four people being assaulted by the soft we can recognize someone being attacked so it can instantly notify police enough in a period of three weeks the identification process can go from one fifty fifty to a hundred percent accurate that 's amazing but i think that i mean maybe people need to have a little bit of an update of where technology as as as developing and how quickly the software is capable of identifying what it 's looking at that 's why that 's why that 's why I 'd never I 'd never play chess against a computer these days how and just counselors just mentioned the tagging problem and they have sensors now that have sort of sniffer abilities and can identify when the chemicals that are involved in spray paint and things like that are occurring and so once again Annette 's and their troubled spots they 've got troubled spots around so once again I saw it I was there yesterday I saw it on the dashboards and it 's exciting and it 's just we we need to be part of this and there is a whole world out there and it 's not about punitive responses it 's about safer communities and a healthier environment for kent at canterbury it 's honestly it is just tech tech to the qatari council elisa is trying to point out it could be risks to things like human rights Privacy that 's like that so there 's any want to see something working yeah can talk about it was just waiting for us so this is a really good point that you 're bringing up but it 's really important and other councils and other organizations are looking at long time so what what the projects specifically doing and what and what some what you 'd expect is front-loading all of these projects with privacy impact statements so we are on a one-to-one dialogue with the Privacy Commissioner and they review these on our behalf to make sure that everybody is kept safe from a privacy point of view the project 's actually got a very unusual and very important other role almost in the space by itself is it not only is it an opportunity where we can collect information and understandings from the folk who build the technologies and but people who actually you know going through processes we 've had lots of questions from our community and wellington about this very issue but what all this inflation is doing is going back into into a specific piece of work that 's being done within the project to go back through the to the Privacy Commissioner saying this is the kind of stuff that 's being considered being talked about because actually the privacy laws in New Zealand and being looked at right now the legislation around ahead of of where our where our legislative frameworks are so this is a nice way as long as we keep you all safe and you know that 's the commissioners are helping us to do that then we can take the learnings from this project because it 's again it 's a proof of concept and that these projects are the only way actually that you can actually learn the stuff is actually by doing it and then you as long as you keep people safe food prices and that 's how we 've chosen to do that yep all right well I 've got a mover in a second Paul and Ellie is there any discussion yani um I think it 's the timing of this is really interesting it 's a little bit unfortunate that we haven 't been able to do this sooner as a city out of the earthquake I think the public actually overwhelmingly want us to have a more sustainable city and sadly we 've lost so much opportunity through the infrastructure it appears that have already been done the building that 's become a sustainable city um I did night when the young students from Kashmir she came and talked to us one of the things that was raised was just actually having good measures of sustainability and you know I 've oi thought we should have a sustainability clock in the square that actually measured what 's happening in terms of the earthquake recovery and rebuild because every time buildings are torn down we actually lose energy and and we had this discussion around saving the town hall that actually the cost to the environment of that decision was quite significant yet probably people don 't actually quite realize the embedded energy that goes into these buildings so I think this is exciting but I think we do need to think about the risks and I think the risks for me are twofold one is around that privacy and those human right those basic human rights issues and I think we need to have some really clear protocols around how it 's used what we 've seen I think in the past sometimes is that certain groups in our society tend human rights abuses and so I think if this can be more open actually hopefully provides a there and more transparent system of monitoring you know for example the cameras that we have in the central city that the police currently have access to why not make those open to everyone in the city so if we can be more open and transparent I would support this and the other risk is that actually just getting the data isn 't actually enough we have time and time again seen areas i think on the paper today 375 complaints around stock and waterways for example and we 've got numerous examples three complaints systems where people actually provide feedback around things not working or things being a problem so I think it 's really important that this does get tied into the consenting the monitoring and enforcement of those sorts of activities that do have negative impacts on our environment air quality water quality at T that it or even mentioned and I think that hopefully you know because one of the challenges has been that through the consenting process that evidence and it has to meet all these certain standards so I think the challenge in this project is to actually have robust enough systems in place that can lead to better decision making and at the moment I think we 've got a long way to go and I 'll just hate to see it become just a way of collecting information without any ability to you be used as evidence to actually support making decisions that actually stop the harm that 's currently being done to our local communities so I 'm thank you for the work that you 're doing on this I think it is exciting although it 's long overdue and it 's a shame we haven 't been able to do it earlier um and I support this going forward but i do think regular report back on what 's happening and engagement with communities is also a really important feature of it yeah Thank lean thank you I 'm gonna need some convincing over this potential social impacts over this I think you know a paul i was at what I here before are these are subjects not objects and people are infinitely more complex and subtle and so is life than the best ignore gee and so I will need a lot of reassurance to keep my vote over the line for this I can see the advantages but you know you have to say how much value will it bring to our rate payer dollar over what we already have and the information we already have upon which to base our decision making so I welcome other contributions to this debate and I hope someone can address and provide reassurance over the potential social impact maybe I can help you Glenn just from what I 've heard is that this is the the wall at the end of the cliff rather than the Emirates at the bottom of cliff face you can attend to issues as they 're happening as opposed to when they 're finished and I think that 's the key part so for me I see this is saya she 's looking after our community in real time as opposed to post what if it actually happens and the authorities in charge of certain areas of their community like the air quality like the water quality it keeps them accountable that makes them accountable cos open-sourced anybody can see this information and connect upon it and I think your knees point about making sure that you can use this data to actually keep that accountability is actually really really important so to me I see this is actually a more opportunity than not Pauline nine years ago it 's in a form there are billions of them around the world and the what you can do is provide information in real time so that if any evolution event is about to happen you can more people to do it to take action entire building complexes have been built such that there there are sensors within the buildings and you can add them retrospectively so that people can actually have entire completes abilities that are so much more energy efficient LED mentioned just the whole thing of open source data and that 's why I 'm so assisted them there 's open source means that there is an array one of the things they would think it was most interesting and an area of high priority for us is reliable about rivers of what 's going on on the bottom of our forums I love to have sensors down there Justin possessions and not doing their job and just so we know that there is no danger even from existing operations of aquifer inclusion and all sorts of things that I think provide safety and and opportunity versity one of the things we have to do as a city is attract talent to the city and the opportunities to use open source data is going to be one of those things we 're really looking at things that go way way beyond us and which use this for example and EDD later November as their they closed off the state highway or driverless cars to appliances but the opportunities for travelers have in terms human safety because it 's you almost always the human factor in a car that causes the problem is just incredible you saw at the Consumer Electronics Show driverless drone passenger drones and they were BBC to show to show them here and there are just so many disruptive technologies coming at us there to say no to information derived in this sort of way p so unusual and weird negative just will not be this message that we 're looking at where we 're trying to promote the city as anything as possible and open source data means that a lot more might be the modern version of King Canute hold back the tide boring and it 's well see the possibilities are endless really with us and it is the way that the world is going it 's happening everywhere and we do not want to lag behind in technology we want to be a leading edge of technology but I wondering if to address the risks that I tend to agree with Glenn that there are risks but we put something in the place to note that work is that you 're collaborating with the privacy Commission to address any potential human rights or privacy risks and I would feel more comfortable if that was noted and because it 's not just so you know it 's great if it 's used to grow our knowledge and develop technologies and share in safety etc but when it begins to be used is it is a bit of a peanut of measure in it will be you talked about graffiti and um n crime so it 's about keeping that and a balance so that it doesn 't become the main priority of its use and I know it 's not what it 's intended to be but it 's about addressing those potential risks so whether we make a number four in other words that note that the Privacy Commissioner will be consulted on the projects is that will that do the truck or yeah I 'd be careful okay I just say putting the cup for the horse here I mean this is about developing a strategy to understand how we can gather data through senses I think it 's not your turn to speak and there is a I 've got a speaking order so i can put you on that list if you want but we 're looking for that just noting that the note that the Privacy Commissioner will be consulted on the projects because there are proof of concept projects which are actual things not strategies so um so um look I 'm also excited about the potential of us I think it 's really good we 've had this debate because it 's clear around people 's privacy we do need safeguards we 're already using sensors you know for example see top it 's very City it people 's cell phones trigger it off and it gives us useful information but you said so you see I think that I certainly support point for here um and I thought I see it really a bit like electricity okay when it came in he will pretty nervous about it as a positive and a negative and it 's how we use it wisely and safely that we have to get to so unlike the advantages I think in terms of our city 's problems a huge if we take as part of transport if you take the parking issues people driving around looking for parks in tell people where the park is in reduce it congestion problem so in that the potential is vicki has said and 20 environmental standards measuring those getting information and playing our part into the contribution and using all this information wisely so i 'm going to support an especially pleased to see the note regarding consultation with the privacy commissioner yeah great all right i 'll put the motion check I 'm pulling actually indicated the Human Rights Commissioner as well I guess I 'm a case-by-case basis but Human Rights Commissioner is consulted of the Privacy Commissioner raises issues but I mean I don 't know as a meter of course he wouldn 't be consulting the human rights commission on every piece of every protein what we 'd be looking at the willing to protocols because you 've made those any examples so we it 's not about recreating something that 's looking at what other cities are doing and taking the beast and moving forward that 's just yeah I mean what was I mean presumably the office of the Privacy Commissioner has been consulted on projects concerns he or she would then consider human doings would be asleep yeah yeah alright so i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye Oh mostly no that 's carried thank you very much and thank you for coming in problems it 's it _"

    "text": "and yeah we 're good I 've just I 'll just make a point around the items we 're doing items 18 and 11 at ten a.m. when one of the staff members will be present public excluded 1230 lunch one to two but given the size of the agenda it may be possible to be completed by them as well um we hit a discussion about item six and seven beforehand and it occurred to us that there is a recommendation an item seven that would mean that it would make sense to deal with item seven coos and then deal with items six so I 'm not sure who 's here to deal with the two items that on the road closures I 'll break would you like to come forward right my name is Philip the reports can I tell me why we want to deal with items this is super items even first it 's because I 'm sorry I just it 's because number because of staff recommendation forward request staff arrange a briefing by ccd you to update the council on the current status the rolling requirements ie road stops in new roads creation and the 5.7 and the content of the paper talks about that receiving reports on a piecemeal basis isn 't actually a good basis for decision making and so we wanted to deal with this recommendation first before we dealt with the other one because we absolutely think it 's it 's vital that we have that briefing yeah can I apologize for the fact that there are two reports unfortunately the first one had been set on motion when this when we got the second request for the Metro school Center and we felt at that time that we would have this proposed recommendation so the council were better informed on the process and what will be required in the future yeah that 's so that was our thinking you know that 's fine I think that 's a it 's a I mean it 's a much better process because I agree with the staff comment that it seems crazy to be dealing with us on a piecemeal basis it really ought to be done in a comprehensive should we traverse the two papers together then if that 's the case in either world I would have made one call for ya I 'll deal with night and six and seven at the same time the first first question that I think that I have is does when it says that we we support the ccd you to proceed we wondered whether that was bitter simply to note the intention of ccd you to proceed because they 're not asking for our commercial of a problem I mean yes essentially we 're just noting what they they request yeah all their through their proposal should I say it 's not a request even that 's just that are obliged to tell us as the row control and authority that 's what they want to do where they want to stop roads right central city well anyway fatty complies to anywhere in can 't_''_227.52 agree but I think he 's been in that they say they have absolute power over the stopping of roads under the exception of the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Act and it 's over the entire actually in the act as whatever however Canterbury 's defined in the act I mean is the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Act yeah but it only covers greater Christchurch well we could find that out for you I look I don 't have the legislation in front of night they 've got the powers to stop these roads they do obviously young from our perspective the Margaret made his book so yes so that 's basically why that reports here secondly or here it goes it 's a great at I spaceship arena yes okay um the concerns that we if we were normally stopping a road ourselves would we do a traffic safety audit I mean what would be you know what I 'm asking is what would be our prerequisite for making these decisions normally and what does the what weird what does CC do you do because I 'm I assume that they 've done some sort of traffic safety audit I mean I drove past here the other day and I have to say I was a little bit concerned about the traffic around Margaret may I stopping the ideal weather tend to be too small plots of land generally attached in front of property and we work we don 't safety audit those are the only ones are really because open path from these ones coming from ccd you yes we would certainly take into account road safety from the necessary Oh Salem isn 't an issue I mean there are other issues about whether we can work whether it man looks somebody 's plot whether it 's those issues about whether it 's if it 's on the coast that it has to become less places I 've invested in the council and there 's also issues of the underground services as well whether whether they need to be diverted or whether candy arranged I understand in this cases there are underground services and we have asked we you know they have offered the easements will be put in place to allow work to be done on those underground services but I i don 't know i can 't answer whether they 've done safety audit or not what are the roles for safety audit you got a big development a supermarket or something a safety if they were involving the shutting of a row we would do a safety audit as part of that consenting process not necessarily as part of the road stopping process so certainly if there are issues around road safety we will obviously be monitoring but certainly happy to take those concerns and have a look at them busier than some super matter Paul you mentioned around services if there are any roots need you done to those services do we incur any costs through that normally know if it 's part of their development if they have to move a service or anything like that is part of the development they pay for that secondly just with regard to areas where there may well be residents like I 'm quite amusing they can have to create a new easement for people to give in and out of their properties otherwise I 'll be landlocked so in its career do they do they consult that community of it um they have to consult with the joining properties that are affected government act but under the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Act 2011 the powers under section 46 allow the chief executive to close or division in erode as it was just interested to understand in terms of Belfort errors where are we acquiring property to make a new row and is that part of the Metro sports land at the crown is already bored or as a separate property additional it is we we aren 't buying any property and they 're basically as broad as part of the the proposal but they have to actually make that legal road so you don 't get landlocked properties so that 's the dark blue on page young I don 't know the last page 67 68 6 so that 's some so we are we will get a piece of road which was different with a piece of road that we have and as part of the development that would be redeveloped it so that those properties can get legal access to their property as every piece of property has to in any subdivision so the light blue that we 're trying to 're going to have that dark blue will be a bit of public road but we 're shutting the grey part and so is it heavy vehicles that use that and are they going to have any access issues here it is heavy vehicles I mean it seems this is an industrial area so was any consideration given to the types of vehicles and we understand is I 've talked to those people in there you can actually see it is one locked so basically I presume that what they have done is actually either fits them with the development there and I 'm sorry I haven 't been down there to have a look I could actually pick it up on a that does service those properties appropriately so the idea that I mean I guess the other logical question is why didn 't we acquire these properties for the Metro sports rather than have to build a new road for three properties interesting play all sorts of issues it 's it 's Sarah who 's acquiring the properties not counsel but but they 're not and that 's to provide they 'll provide the new road and ill then be vested to the council one sees it been instructed and then will be responsible for its maintenance I mean I 'm worried about the wider traffic impacts of shutting a road that you know it and take it with a ratio strength in stock I mean I just want to have confidence that we 're not going to create huge amounts of gridlock and when you look at places like registry from these things actually has conference at all and so is there a kind of traffic assessment did you what you 're saying is no traffic assessment and we just need to go ahead because terrorism this is with regard to two properties Your Lives ballina that 's also the traffic that goes through Horatio Street which does go between do it and antiguos and in terms of the Metro sport I actually would have thought that we are going to need to have some feeder street so I don 't think we can put all the traffic up Stuart straight I think what you 'll find the plan of the metro but we have a got other feeds in there so we 're not actually feeding off both those streets we 're certainly feeding off from stuart street i believe in the eventual plan and i could we have tabled them with the council at some stage but I could bring other plans so we have looked at the traffic flows as part of the accessible cities and as part of some of the projects about the traffic flows that will go around not only this but the other Inca projects that are being proposed and that did get built into the original overall concept plans around accessible cities can we change the resolution so instead of saying supports the ccd you to proceed and stop just other sorry supports this easy do we change supports the ccd you to proceed to read notes the ccd you intention to stop or the CC to use intention to stop a section using because it and can we go back to item number six and do the same with that one because what what we 're doing is the ccd you can do we don 't have any say over that whatsoever I don 't think that people kind of realize that council is somewhat disempowered in their environment yeah that 's creepy yeah and I was just trying to understand Christopher may was just so basically they come in they stop the road they tell us they want to stop the road we say coal go ahead we can 't do anything its your right to do that as long as you tell us they do the plan the design of the road they do whatever they want with a safety audit or no safety audit and then they say council here 's the road we 've designed well it seems I can credibly cumbersome process why don 't we just do it anyway like we 're going to own the land they 're going to visit back today own the land we don 't they 'll transfer that piece of land that little piece of land back to us but it 's no different to the establishment of any other Road around a development quite often standards and then they transferred no different to a subdivision or anything and so they own that big block of land they 'll develop it to our standard yeah and then give it back to us and the obligation is they must consult with us but they don 't actually actually have to ask our permission but if you take alpha straight or offered terrors that the crown doesn 't own those lands that 's there 's a public road that we are surely anybody noticed or it never comes how to stop Oh No yes but they 've got power to stop us and then we have to transfer it under the conditions are sharing agreement that 's why we 're here today yeah so could somebody move let 's do six and seven together with someone like to move that we noting that I 've changed that to noting see CDs intention to stop rather than supporting it move by le seconded by Phil I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried did you say that yeah yeah know that Peters hear you so we 'll move on to item 9 we 've done that as a done loans item teen that it 's my intention to have this lie on the table item number team so we 'll come back we 'll bring it forward onto the agenda again when we 've had another workshop on it right Peter you 've arrived come Eric now that you 've set down come back to the table item number eight _"

    "text": "okay can I call to the table please Lindsay Caswell and we 're circulating Lindsay some supplementary material that you 've prepared for us one of the joys aging is that start losing your hearing and eyesight is not a problem up in heaven okay well welcome we 've got about 10 minutes okay you know that you know the process speaks feel like a week we can hear you hopefully you can hear us okay my name is William Lindsay Carswell I 'm a retired school teacher and I taught economics and accounting at Kirikiri high school for a number of years I have a Commerce degree from the University of Canterbury shortly after the poor September 2010 earthquake legislation was passed the cannery of quake response and recovery act 2010 an extraordinary has we conferred on the Minister for the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Gerald Bromley Gerry Brownlee this was replaced with a Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Act after the februari 2011 earthquake the same month of the first earthquake stember 2010 concern was expressed by a group of academic experts and constitutional law on the powers conferred on the concerns over can reach Earth quaked legislation outlined and scholars open letter dated September 2010 any claim that such safeguards are unnecessary because the Expos will be used white will be wisely used at wisely unsparingly applied and that informal consultation and public pressure will sure that this happens must be resisted only formal legal means of accountability ultimately enforceable through the courts okay constitutionally acceptable however the minister respondent said that the government doesn 't need to justify the law and any suggestion it will be misused it 's not worth responding to mr. Brown he says he knows with its this location the people of Canterbury have suffered and says that they expect the government to do whatever it can to put their lives back together I want to talk about the Hagley oval I 've spent a lot of my time over the last 23 years on this issue but it 's subject to a lot of other things have been going on in Canterbury over the last ever since the earthquake well though the battle over the cricket oval has ended there are still unanswered questions was made an anchor project and the blueprint released in July 2012 can 't_''_210.87 be cricket had always wants to go back to hagley park they used to be there they could ask to leave in the 19th century because the public got second being charged to go and watch cricket so they went off and bought what was claimed known as length has the park that 's how that all happened unfortunately the Hagley Park management plan prevented this they couldn 't get back and because of the plane but the passing of the Sarah Act made it possible and can read cricket made their move test of a submission are a series of emails and leaders with your quake recovering Minister chief executive of Sarah and the urban sment Ombudsman 's office requesting information regarding the placement of the oval and the blueprint I these are all oh I requests i had made not only to those organizations but the sport new zealand treasury so on an email released on the oh I a virtually was a local government version go away from the Christchurch City Council indicates the oval there were meetings going on with him cricket people staff at Sarah and stuff from the Christchurch City Council it 's beginning to dribble out the last letter from the minister he advised me after I had to wait 70 working days for a response that there is no new information covered by your latest request Sarah also buys me the same I find it difficult to believe that the minister and Sarah had no information that clearly shows the process and those responsible for the placement of the oval as an anchor project i have seen nothing how it was actually done it just suddenly happened look at people they got what they wanted it 's apparent that the fares for the academic experts were correct the minister has misused his prepares conferred on him under the legislation my recommendations are quite support in christchurch we need to return the full democracy and a rebranded sarah will not achieve later we need for democracy where there are the usual processes that you can turn to the moment we don 't have it the bill needs to ensure munsters powers be limited or curtailed fact removing more to give it would be provide you quite satisfactory yeah well that 's what I want to say I cannot believe tell that oval ever got there and I 've had people say to me how did it happen nobody can tell me the minister won 't tell me Sarah won 't tell me they have given me some information the Ombudsman got some more information the last pieces of correspondence and here are the letter I sent to to the Ombudsman it 's about a four page letter in the details by letters and correspondence with the minister and Sarah and their response back to me so on and I have had phone calls from the Ombudsman and I did they did get out Sarah they got a briefing paper which had previously been given to me but had been so heavily sensitive was meeting this and also got which was extremely rare I got the legal opinion that the minister asked for at the time but time he received it The Blueprint had already been released and he did stage had put a donor Thank you Thank You Lindsay and thanks for the material at some certainly extensive there any questions move met thank you very much for your submission and I 'm hoping you 'll take this for the intent it means i find the Hagley oval very interesting and I think it 's very considering we 're here talking about the regeneration of Christchurch and so part of this is about having a a city that was okay but possibly stagnating in parts and could always have done better the earthquakes come along and there 's a chance to rethink City and you 'd look internationally there 's very few opportunities or times this has happened before and so it 's very interesting when you look at the Hagley oval because you 'd like to say there was some people who weren 't very keen on the idea but now it 's actually being built I would argue there 's very few people against it because what they 've now seen is arguably the best cricket ground in New Zealand and I 've been there when you an international game from there the game will finish and people will go into the city eventually and have dinner and accommodation it 's part of what makes a vibrant city and so you 're right at first people kind of like no we have never really done this in our Park before albeit a long time ago but now they 're actually saying hey you know anchor projects like this are really good well a couple of points first of all when you steal the jewel out of the crown you could hardly go wrong it was always going to be successful in there but it was stolen secondly five years before a new hagley park management plan was produced so a two-year process and can be crack at that stage they put a proposal empty that they would they want to play international cricket there and they wants to put screens around to shield it off so if people can go along and watch and and not have to pay that received about the second largest number of responses and opposition to it than any of the other five years previously the public said no to it but out of the élysée before it was all done in secret if we had gone through a proper process if consultation had occurred and all the people in christchurch could have had a say on it and earthly the result of that was yes let 's build it then you can argue but that never happened never got that chance at all and as fully the environment court hearings their hands were tied they had to assume the lawyer from Sara came along and said that because of the legislation the Hagley Park management plan now assumes now allows for the oval to be built there the courts couldn 't turn it down those who spent thousands of dollars opposing it and me and the environment court just wasted their money totally wasted it I guess some people probably laugh behind their back you journeys got a question for the submission particularly all of the attached Ohio requests what certainly reflects my experience with the organization as well but the Hagley Park is actually covered by the bill can I we 've seen no evidence as to why hagley park should be part of the bill I look I 'm not a hundred percent on me what I just wanted to say was let 's get rid of pot let 's get back to full democracy combiner details you 're just raises oh I 'm not sorry I can 't_''_754.24 so I full democracy as you 're asking for what the Hagley Park Reserve management plan yeah that would have meant that any application for something like The Oval would have to go through the force of Monsieur process in fact it wouldn 't it wouldn 't the management plan actually prevented it totally prevented it so those provisions were trumped by the recovery plan in thank you yeah totally okay Lindsay in that case thing can I thank you for your submission okay going to or any more information about sports users in its involvement in the article and the so-called confidential underwriting which can 't_''_792.73 be crooked referred to any other busy the taxpayer yeah i 've got all the emails thanks so much thanks for coming to tape _"

with me notes there was this something else written there was an email a god it just said we need we need more local consultation through the powers being returned to local government no well there 's not a lot add to that really and that 's exactly what we want and what I 'm saying we are I 'm 79 now so I 'm sort of talking on behalf of some of us older people on this consultation is a big thing actually what do you think to him so when I think all these planning meetings and God knows what 's being gone on over the voice of this 70 year olds an eight year olds you know much against common belief we 're not gaga r we just startin to be people with a lot of experience you know and consultation is big part of her and just let 's explain how i live in parklands that 's up on the northeast part of the country were in the city we got how am I pretty hard in the februari quakes was februari June and December so we 've shoveled a favor of I 'll call a liquefaction and Ellie called its infancy and it 's been a hell of a five years to be honest for all of us at the beginning it 2012 we started running a series of older generation forums the first one was nearly four years ago now Sarah we had Roger Sutton Roger kept saying be patient to all get through this in time we were playing now to him that well at our age you know time is one thing that 's not on our side and that was four years ago it 's quite a few people no longer with us we had a number of forums afterwards with the insurance and eq c and all that sort of thing all promised a heck of a lot nothing seems to have happened which has been in the same situation well not the same brits not moving very fast tell you about my own street it 's like many others i 'll just use my street as an example to cul-de-sac the 64 houses and I guess 18 to be demolished all the rest repaired my house being one of them that had to go and from the time it took before on and I moved out of the house to let them knock it down you know we moved to summon availability up to that time we 'd had 75 people through our house you know measuring looking reporting coming back measuring again 75 people then while we 're out now rebuilding the house to be over 100 people involved in building a house what do you think so this it 's taken 200 people three years or over to build born three bedroomed house I 've find that well I was going to see unbelievable disbeliever because it 's happened and there we are there 's a lot taken a lot longer than that now when I say that was 18 to rebuild ours was the second we moved back into a house earlier this year and it 's a lovely house actually it 's better than what we had but when we walk down the drive the street the street still in it chaotic mess that it 's been in for the last five years and that some houses being rebuilt leg hours followed on that 's coupled and process of being built but they 're still houses it doesn 't be touched yet so this building process is taking is and because your house is finished it doesn 't mean you 're out of it because you 're still living in at the whole time i mean when i was on the building sites used to go home at night and get away from it now a minute 27 you know hours a week and it goes on and on and it 's grinding worst things as his state of the streets themselves me my poor little Suzuki Swift God knows it wasn 't built to be a Land Rover but that 's where i 'm using you know you when you like coming to town today you never know which way I 'm coming in and I don 't got a clue which way are we going back the changes we 've got the road people there were the sewers people there that people put the drains they 've arrived a month ago and they 're all over the place and were very pleased to see them but it 's taken five years to get there I remembered when the first quake in our street came you know I was out there shoveling a trench to relinquish action to get the raw sewerage away that was coming out with a ground and I thought well I don 't need an engineer to tell me that my so as is stuffed you know but I back in five years time to do it and it 's not just the roads that 's affecting the that 's the biggest the biggest one for the older people I 'd love to take you for a walk around our place if you 've got the time come around just take a quarter of an hour 's walk and you 'll see exactly what I mean got old people I mean me I 'm reasonably fit and I go out for a walk with the factory way bifocals you know you see your head butt down there gets a bit blurred in the road that 's always holds there they 'd ever seen before and trenches across from you know gravel all over the place if you 're walking with a stick or particular walking frame I can 't go anywhere we 've got old people who 's been sentenced to home detention they 've serves five years of it now and they don 't know when they 're gonna get paroled you know and this is wrong the lookout if you wanted a hold history what 's happening up in go on forever tell me abut I 'm not sure I 'm just wanted to go but this word with consultation come back to me little bit of paper we want to be able to consult properly with authorities and we feel that the much easier power and this room so we can talk to the powers that be and hopefully they can tell us when we how long it would be before we can get our lives back again because because we 're wondering how many more of us will die before that happens John thank you listening to submissions can sometimes as forest gump would have see a bit like a box of chocolates you don 't quite know what you 're going to get and from your little piece of paper you 've been able to give us a remarkable sense of the frustration and the challenges that are confronting so many people in Christchurch so we just wanted to thank you on behalf of the committee for doing that can you think also please Olivia for taking the time and trouble to peanut a brief submission that has led to you sitting here in front of us and giving us that wonderful verbal visionary insight Thank _"

    "text": "in please they 've all you 've been sitting up there patiently oh I 'm also a newbie do this experience patience with me yeah well no problem welcome we 've got about 10 minutes and your written submission was was brief so we 're looking forward to you expanding on that thank you thinking just first off I haven 't done an interpretation on the bill but if I was I 'd almost be word for word with Susan on the back here that 's pretty much my interpretation too and I 'll just speak to one of my points in that regard which was I think we need to clearly defined it hint the handover process to local management at the end of the government 's involved in 2021 so my concern is that the government will continue its major involvement post 2020-21 as well and i think that the bill allows it to do that and my interpretation my reading but anyway I didn 't really want to come here to speak about the bill to say I just want to speak about my experiences and how handouts chi it 's a process for me so initially I 'm a local I was born here 1961 86 hospital volunteer for about 45 years the last 20 years I 've owned and operated a business in the central city and walk through water street near scourge on camera canon and I just sort of wonder initially go through that process but floor get on to that I just want to talk a little bit about the interaction we 've had with the earthquake through church and church groups and I go to st. saviors alongside the christchurch cathedral st. Christopher 's with a lot of door knocking and the eastern suburbs based out the st. faiths st. Luke 's and say can 't save Ambrose and I 'll just touch on one of the things that the message that really came through from that was just about everybody see there 's somebody else was often where don 't worry about us so there was this overwhelming feeling that there was somebody worth and there 's one story that sort of upset with me is it was actually in there 's another number of Springs of this back up behind houses and there was a lady in the house on her own husband wrote with a brand-new baby it was raining the state how I think she had pots in every room in her house to catch water and she 's I don 't worry with us there 's others worse and we are not many so that 's part of that process I really want to get onto my working situation and the photographs I 've shown you the first one that rubber moldings building near scourge is number four walker street and here in the CBD initially we sort of survived the earthquake went through the engineers and different things and we had a problem and some of the inlays block concrete block and lays will loosen this up stairs of the building on the sides which could some aggravation for the neighbors and so an engineering report was done a town that a bond beam was cracked so essentially that said well you 're out of the building you can 't_''_195.209 be a tool off and set my little office and I rings particular demolition god I said I 'll he 'll be 23 weeks away and he said no Wikipedia tomorrow in the end though the reality was we see another engineer who assessment on the building and found that the superstructure the building is very strong and the building an ex who was on salt another builder who since I was unsoldered again and picked up target two thousand bucks in the process but the buildings that photograph I took this morning it 's still there it 's inoperable you can 't use it can 't go into it for 20 20 or 30 thousand bucks you could secure the broken bond beam and it 'd be a usable building which is a shame because since then I never fitted myself said gypsy mechanic I sort of traveled around high shear workspaces with different people of different occasions and occasionally work and people 's backyards which isn 't the best but it 's it 's the reality of today now I 've got a second building the next one down is that how could this building also was supposed to be demolished because of quite damaged couple of friends end up buying this particular building and twenty twenty thousand dollar investment later it 's now at thirty-four percent of code it 's tentative and insurable so the point that I 'm trying to make is without further local knowledge and input we 're not easy getting an accurate picture of what we do need and what we don 't need what we can say well couldn 't say I would argue that there 's probably hundreds of buildings have been knocked down there probably shouldn 't be so we turn over in page and we 'll look there and we 're actually looking for more house F back towards a hospital essentially now this is the whole area where the new sports precinct will go eventually but in the air there would have been in probably a hundred buildings if not more all probably see great buildings you know the sort of buildings that trades people use it you know huge amounts of money but Nina share to put the gearing they 've all but in that interim there 's another two years that people like myself have Nicole doing their best data do that and that the point that I like here that I think one of the options is that week let 's create a workshop brilliant votes basically so we we anticipate putting the new stadium which is beside the new transitional Cathedral there 's an area of me which is also part of the frame you can build colgate on build buildings or relocatable workshop type situations which don 't need a huge foundation they don 't need a concrete pad and meet a deep data that if you use poles you can actually just put concrete around those poles and secure them and so you know five years ten years whatever when the crown when that land is actually required you could take your building in total off so there 's sort of initiatives like that but I think we really need to look at because there 's a lot of people like me we don 't really have anywhere to work from yeah not not easily and well is you know once i fighting my things up do i really need to be here okay actually earn a decent living here or should i go to western australia all we work because as a mechanic it 's a it 's a skill you can travel with so i just want to make those points because i think as we go forward we need to address people and we need to address the creative ability you take all those are tataki thai people that you know create things they never make any money but but they need somewhere to do it from and if you can create a little village workshop village for them to continue doing that because historically they 've always been broken down old buildings all over to the show so that was my point I want to talk about that i also want to talk a little bit about my experience of eq c and so initially i live in the area spreyton which wasn 't particularly badly knocked around to have a lot of ink you add a lot of liquid face or anything thing I 'm sweep it 's all good and the initial eqc guy came rounders assessment he makes all good looks pretty good give you and so probably a year later before we follow through the process and I think I ACOs a builder to come over look and he walked through the house and he said I said you want to get the levels that I saw sup no no I get the levels done so then we went back through the process for the eqc and they say all I know it 's too late for that so sort of hand it away from this ik will come and do the levels then blowww beholders kind of at a level and we 'll start cracking in the foundation and so they said i will repeat some of us and repair some of that I had to build again he said well you do that three or four times months as three or four times as much as they are allowing and so the end result of that is that they 've since been back they 've gone away through the press now that all foundation works you 'll have a consent bqc is not talking about under consent it 's sort of like this little game of cat mouse and to me I look at EQC as the government you know the big brother the boss the taxpayer they should be looking at up to my interests but I think the reality is it 's the other way around I don 't think they 're looking at more interest so I think they 're trying to do a good deal for the government whoever and you know I could be the punter that loses out or not they look at myself no time I 'd find that a little bit disappointing but anyway that 's that 's a guy who kept mass and so far I 've enjoyed it in my last thing I just want to make a few references to the ccd you plan which a number of us made that number of representation is early on because it really doesn 't make a lot of sense and especially in regards to the automotive industry where 'm along same as the street just clear the space and thunder tool off they have since changed that which is great because we talk about millions millions of dollars and you also talking about one of the industries that actually was going well and bringing a lot of money into the CBD so I think without local involvement we 're just wasting truckloads money where I see without people they see know what 's happening on the ground and so without a process actually bringing those people together I know so if you ask the question somebody before of how you do that and it 's a very difficult thing that answer because it has been collaborative and you 've got to have a number of people and we 've got to get together and you 've got to be patient and you 've got to work through a process of coming to a good answer because there are good answers out there it won 't be perfect answers but there 'll be better answers so that 's pretty much what I want to speak to okay never used 's got a question yeah after the CBD was cleaned out all the people that were in the CBD moved out because they had to go out can we go in from from where I 7 from hearing you am i right that the people who moved out that couldn 't afford high rents if effectively not often found some of them haven 't found a places they 've moved out because a lot of those places outside of the CBD have been upgraded and rebuilt because you couldn 't build there and make progress and so am i right in saying that you think there are a number of people in your situation you 've got no home and they 're not going to be able to find it outside of the CBD and therefore you think space is going to have to be made in the CBD for some lower cost lend to be made available I think there needs to be space made him the CBD okay my situation I want to be back in the CBD okay and the price off the land which is something issue and for me to actually come back into this evening he 's very very difficult but and also another answer a good friend that was one block away from me in the CBD he 's closed his business packed up and went to Australia now works in the mines in the brisbane doing very nicely from self so I think there are a number of people that probably don 't live in the city anymore that would entertain the idea of running businesses and hitting businesses in finding and having space but one of the one of the points is to actually better afford their space and go to generate the kind of money sit in the car business to a certain extent the cost of care arrears repairs our limited to what the market dictates and so perf when guys playing thousand bucks a week and another guys playing two thousand in that has an effect on your profitability the end of the day so the price of land and the price of location but it doesn 't change the fact if you want to have a vibrant you garages in each shops you need takeaways your needle words of things and you need to try and encourage industry and some form of manufacture we 're possible which is something with gloss to my 35 games if we use pretty much all the time but you might think you a great fish submission Thank You Julie in some time thank you _"

    "text": "I and bf yeah we were using this and probably would have done a lot more if we really know understand understood the process well we don 't bite and you 're most welcome no it 's not like the Dragons Dean is it no not quite Oh notwithstanding the impressiveness of this council chamber that 's right so we 've got about ten minutes we 've got your written submission over to you how we use the ten minutes but it 's always good if we can have an opportunity to engage with you before we expire those ten minutes okay thanks ok so if even I represent ourselves but as well as that we 're representing the new bright and sustainable coastal village project we as a project of participating in the regeneration of New Brighton we 're co-creating sustainable sustainable neighborhood and abrasion based on the principles of sorry ok you want to start again you know I can hear now doing that it 's good ok good so we 're participating in the regeneration of New Brighton is the new bright and sustainable coastal village project and cohousing cohousing means it 's a balance of private and public spaces within the village and of course there 's 12 principles of permaculture which form the basis of our values there 's not enough time to share what those are here today but in a nutshell they are about Earth care people care and fair share so community is at the heart of our project and we 've had several people comment on how closely our preliminary plans and what we 're doing and body what was actually expressed and sheer an idea after the earthquakes we 've been engaging with a cruise ship city council staff since we formed on 2014 and most recently with a deputation to the Community Housing and Economic Development Committee because the stage were at an hours at the stage of acquiring some land in order to progress our project and from that a resolution was decided to investigate the titles in the future use of our preferred site which is that the my City Council car park and council staff are actively involved and researching it at the moment so our master plan as well and the village will be an exemplar demonstrating 21st century living we designed to sit lightly on the planet ecologically and economically and as already mentioned the heart of the development is the community and we together will participate in the design and management of our living environment it 's a different approach to developing living spaces and one that empowers those living there and the wider community as well the concept plan is scalable and transferable I 'm not sure if you actually got our plans you did a fantastic we 'd actually didn 't know it was the last minute thing last night that we thought we 'll try and send it to you so what you 've got there as as the supporting documents that we used in a deputation to the council gives you an idea of what we 're about so in this notice that I use the word we so that 's because there is active collaboration between all members of our organization organization as well as other New Brighton community organizations including the you buy from business and landowners actively collaborate with the wider community with organizations such as the veba project and social enterprise spacecraft systems limited which is developing wiki house in New Zealand as its collaboration that forms a nucleus of our way of being and when it 's authentic we found that it becomes a very very powerful force for change or think or thin took democratic decision-making within our organization we are trialing processes and we 've reworked them until we 're finding a good fit that fits our village community in particular so with that in mind it 's our hope that the greater Christchurch regeneration bill will impracticable a real we regeneration and transfer it allow it to occur we hope that all who want to participate will feel empowered and supported to do so just imagine the possibilities of that given all the other speakers I mean we 've been listening for quite some time yesterday and this morning as well the energy is there so in order for our project than your bright and sustainable coastal village project and initiatives like ours to have the best chance of succeeding we and implemented in such a way that ensures that a we 're actually able to participate and not be swallowed up and bureaucracy and be it needs to focus on long-term regeneration and transformation which may include non commercial benefits rather than short-term and only commercial interests so for this reason we consider of the options and the things available that the option 3 + would be the best way forward for us and you all have that as a reference so we ask that when making your recommendations you ask yourselves will this make it easier for projects such as ours to fly will it enable groups that I prepare to step out and just do it like you heard from Colin Merck yesterday his project took 25 years to come to fruition but you know he was a person that just stepped out and did it we 'd like those thoughts of projects to be supported another question you need to ask us will it assisted us to connect with and work with others in our communities to you know add strengths and connections and ultimately will it transformation for the people and by the people in our case of Greater New Brighton Christ Church in New Zealand thank you thanks very much now met it 's got a question yeah far away thank you very much good submission so new brighton is singled out i suppose is one area that was highlighted under this I think probably everyone will agree that it 's much needed and would very much like to see you bright and come back to the light july to the strength of the whole region what might the some risks here i suppose and as we 've seen that 's playing out across the city is that christchurch disposals very sort of a traditional conservative town things have been around for a while within the earthquakes through everything up and everything was kind of up for grabs and as we 've heard through submitters a lot of people submitted had ideas but not everyone can be pleased and some people get a bit disaffected by that from a ground-up approach when new brighton is regenerated have you got any thoughts about how you say engaged people who have actually ended up on the losing side because their ideas win yeah we 're great question you know it 's had so many in the past so many sort of hopeful things happening and then they haven 't happened you know the pool would be one of those but underneath everything a new brush and it 's a very strong community isn 't it connected I mean it does have you know differences of opinion but overall everybody is on the page and wanting you know it to be regenerated in a way that 's not like the Gold Coast it keeps its own personality and is connected with the city as well so because it 's a smaller area may be a bit more homogenized without being generalizing too much so won 't be at risk of maybe what 's happening with greater christ church with us sort of polarizing views on things me I don 't think so no I I think you know the new business sorry the new brighton business and landowners association when it was formed it has had a really there is there time just to make once brick come into David 's Christian to the preview speaker about the central city you heard us mention our the Viva project and we think one of the best things that the crown could do is take the four finalists that all had fantastic sustainable urban villages make that happen all four of them it may be a you know for a start you may have to let the land go to a negotiated price because I believe one of the reasons that the Viva project which we are associated with the land price was not negotiable and so the Viva project directly pulled out at the second stage because in all honesty we couldn 't meet our the values and the vision because it was going to make it too expensive people living there how that 's done collaboration with all those people involved it may be that the land the government does not get the full benefit of the land costs immediately maybe there 's some sort of thing near that it could be at least for a period of know I mean what 's possible from outside that land values in the CBD are being held falsely high given what 's happened I 'm not criticizing people for what 's happened to land values but it seems to me that the current land value in Christchurch given how much development and the intervening period has happened outside of the CBD the end the lack of demand for new buildings in the CBD area means that the land value in that central CBD area may in actual fact currently be quite low heavy are you aware of anyone having considered what the current land values are there because it may well be that you brought that you know that the land value in that area is actually quite affordable been involved in real estate the land value is too high at the moment for most projects to work well is that another way of saying that people 's expectations as to land value are higher than its actual land value because there doesn 't seem to be much development happening at higher land values no there isn 't because this release the land they won 't negotiate the land value the East frame is part of that we were more the core broke was told for the Viva that we could play around with a little bit of it in the short term but there is no negotiating and we were also told that part of the land around the Litchfield area as three and a half thousand a square meter it 's absolutely unworkable for anybody to build and especially if you 're looking at residential and small developments thank you usually you did you have a question no okay and thank you both very much for taking time to with us that 's a I hope it wasn 't just brawling and oh thank you thanks very much appreciate your taking the time any foot _"

    "text": "good morning you 've been sitting there watching the process so you know what we 'd sort of doing we 've got 10 minutes we 've got your written submission it 's over to you how we use the use the 10 minutes but welcome thank you um yes my name is akin second i am a registered architect and was strong interest in urban design I I do work at this question City Council um but the submission of purely a personal submission I have been involved with the post-earthquake activities from the sep tember earthquake onwards i was part of the exhibition team that tried to respond to the first earthquake organized by the institute of architects here but I exhibiton was cut short wait a second earthquake and our panels were used in the emergency situation for the first maps and communication so I my involvement I suppose goes back in a quite personal and then after that I 've been I was part of the Central City blend team which had prepared the initial recovery Central City recovery plan the council and that was done in I also heaven and a child and a future interest in the city so i 'm kinda feel like I 'm talking on behalf of her and her peers who will be living in here and I 've been in all with various plan changes so very familiar with our ma however today I really only want to make a couple of points for my submission history but I realize it 's really only true and in its I just want to appeal well firstly I want to thank you for coming to Christ Church to hear this it 's a very very meaningful gesture definitely shows a real interest in hearing what we have to say so my first point is really want to encourage you to take the opportunity to do some thing a piece of legislation that can be word leading I have been listening to the other submissions and I think this opportunity has been highlighted a number of times that this can be a model that others can use and also not five years on from a disaster but potentially immediately after a disaster if intention to do a joint activity in the next five years local and central government but I was a little bit concerned about few of the words and in the intention of the bill and the purpose of the bill and that 's one of them is a focused an expedited that sounds wonderful yeah we do what action we want to get stuff done and I think the city has shown that it can get stuff done local leadership has emerged and did things but my main concern is that let 's not forget the long-term outcomes as well so that really needs to be balanced to get stuff done usually you need to isolate and less than 2 is fewest people voice or month perhaps not listen but active engagement it 's harder if you 're trying to really get focused and get something done immediately and I think in the regeneration phase we really need to take the time it takes to engage actively consistently with all the parties because if this is going to survive it 's only going to survive with ownership local ownership and sometimes the outcomes are not different when you involve people but the ownership is completely different and that 's what we want it might well be that we end up with the same result either way but if we involve the people in the community that will be our intent we will have custodians that 's one end yeah so community involvement and empowering communities and recognizing the local leaders you 've actually heard a few of them yesterday and community doesn 't always agree with each other it doesn 't have a single voice I 'm fearful believer that I do building projects and I i I 've been in working parties in job working groups but it 's incredibly important for the community to hear it each other so that 's one point I 'd like to make is that engagement shouldn 't be engaging individually with people but letting making the framework so that people can hear each other as well there 's a lot of learning in their process and I 'll stop now okay David 's got a question than your journey as I 've Crown 's going to do with its land and how it decides it you know the crown nouns big swaths of the CBD you know I can see the issues around the Haven and respect to the red zone land that sank you are quite different and respect of the you know getting activity and starting to rebuild Christchurch in the communities that are needed to be part of the CBD how 's that going to happen maybe as the revision sort of starting to be developed as to how the crown takes its decisions as to when it sells lend the price it sells it I understand the crown played well over the odds for a lot of the land that it acquired in order to facilitate the widespread demolition and Christchurch and start with a clean slate tongue now there will be pressures from some to hold up land values other people who won 't land released how does how does the crown decide what it 's going to do with its Len so if we 're speaking particularly about central city I think central city here has land banking pre-earthquake as well so the price of things in what does the real market was never clear to me so I don 't see that issue being any different now and a single entity that holds so much land I think crown has to be he 's the remain involved so I 'm not actually against crown involvement at all I would support more the model debt crisis city council submission proposes that I wasn 't involved with that submission but I have I bet it and i think the proposed model of having joint real joint approach is what 's needed and then you need to work with private development as well so it 's not just going to be local central owned central city we can 't just local and central government counter oh no central city think that has to be complex it has to have all parties in there and need to be talking so we 're five years on from the earthquake make sure it 'll be six years on what time period do you envisage the crown starting to release its land suspect there 's obviously not much duties I I suspect it 's not going to be all in one so I would expect a transitioned approach and maybe an opportunistic approach find out where it 's working we there 's a market and start releasing their rather than releasing it all at once I mean something they happened immediately after the earthquake was that we put a red line around the central city and held it all in for a couple of years and everything started happening around the edges of it so so we 're now actually seeing that of course hindsight is a wonderful was the giver that perhaps we should have allowed more pockets well when about Elaine developers on Christchurch gave evidence to this committee yesterday and said them until the crown effectively let 's go yeah private sector can 't do anything that 's right so so I don 't think there 's there has to be a time frame for the whole thing you can start now with some there must be some opportunities there must be some interest when the new Christchurch plan do you think that 's the time to start or as the as the crown going to need to wait until we have these regenerate Christ huge plans and the years to come no I don 't think you need to wait certainly not wholesale waiting yeah it 's not going to work because we live in a complex environment in life things will happen we will never have a perfect plan or a perfect decision so do you understand where they those land release decisions are going to be taken under this new framework are they going to be taken by the crown through this crown company or through regenerate Christchurch I 'm not I 'm not cleared personally what I understand is that regenerate a Christchurch as as the strategy and planning head and there are a couple of development arms and I 'm not fully confident with the full text of the bill but from what I 've seen it 's not actually to me it 's not entirely clear as to how those two development arms and original questions will work with each other and to a progress of suggestion as to how that can we you made reference to to development level I 'm sorry ramco in developed question new one the new so what 's onion is that the council 's own agency which doesn 't own any land well I like that only land it used alone but it isn 't it doesn 't own the land that 's been acquired it hasn 't holding all those yep quite good thank you you shame um thank you for the submission given your expertise and experience with planning processes the frustration were some RMA planning process is taking too long they we 've also heard submissions about how alienating the district plan fast-track review processes have you got any comments on what a good planning process involves one and just we 've also heard from people and talking about master plans for particular areas of land involving developers and the community so just any comments on how we could improve the planning process that 's a lot of pressure per person a lot of intelligent people have tried to solve this my personal view as well the fast track one that um I think I 'm gonna go back to what ly and LZ you say some things and I couldn 't tell you what list of things they are but some things can 't_''_669.51 be fast-tracked and some things can but we have to make those decisions as s collaborative as possible so that the decision which is not going to be perfect regardless of who that 's made by then people who are involved with the decision make it right I think we don 't make perfect decisions we make the decision with the best available information and then we make it right to make it right as the part we need to work on so I think appeal rights are important in terms of a good planning process I don 't think that should be truncated um not too much anyway perhaps it 's too long in an hour may now I 'm open to thinking that it might be no 10 years is too long before you find that something apart from that I think the parallel processes the legislation to have parallel processes in a genuine active in forming process alongside whatever legislation is doing thank you thank you quick last question pool gone I didn 't it occur thank you for a very well-informed presentation I understand you worked in Ankara for some time and over the last couple of days we 've heard of some international comparisons Manchester perhaps Pittsburgh I was just wondering if you could give a quick idea I suppose of in the types of comparison with those other places you 've worked that point you made about outcomes versus ownership given uncut as a quite a planned city and pets somewhat more authoritarian and the approach they take to planning their just just to set the record right I actually I 've worked in turkey for a very short time most of my working life has been in New Zealand and I had a short shorts down and then Mike with the galactics the so through the last five years and especially from immediate after earthquake suggestion I 've gone to talks and presentations that I can 't count or list but there Orleans and people have come here both the policymakers and designers or people who have been involved with the processes and we 've heard from united kingdom good from people from Detroit which is more about you than regeneration not so much disaster recovery and all I can say is that one thing that comes to me from all the first talks is that things take always a little bit longer than you think and some things take a little bit shorter than you think so and it 's very hard to foresee that it to start so trying to do a perfect thing is not necessarily going to take custody and I would say that it 's not so much the cities themselves but the tools that they have used and there are a number of international organized tools for doing things so cave the center for architecture in UK which is now closed by they have an enormous library that 's still available and people who have used caves tools around the world would be able to help with some of those processes and there 's a delayed 's no professor angelic edmonds she 's talked to us actually just last year and they have done a number of things in Adelaide involving communities and using really powerful tools that educate and involve so I think tools are there everywhere internationally and nearby and our own communities our own local leadership forgetful as the going to rubbles the center for architecture that you 've heard from they have been educating themselves in doing the spitter and better so I think tools are here already we need to some find a way of gout galvanizing this thank you I think you give a persuasive argument in favor of effect finding mission to institute and on that note we need to bring this submission to a close so it can come thank you very much for very useful and thoughtful thought-provoking contribution thank you very much thank you thank you _"

    "text": "fir main Fred Ron tipple scourge sorry man but I probably mangled done welcome we 've got about three minutes some more Nimbus good morning members have got your rhythm submission yes but we 're looking forward to you now expanding that dumb or elite oh that 's right here so welcome thank you very much and yeah so after the earthquakes we had the sheer an idea and there was quite a great sense of optimism of renewal and future proofing of the city the main themes that transpired through this process were that and people wanted to restore the city in an ecologically culturally and socially and economically sustainable way and while some of the ideas have been adopted many certain citizens are disenchanted by the direction and face of the rebuild they are still costly to build and upkeep unsustainable anchor projects looming the stadium and Convention Center while her by the horizontal infrastructure is still partly broken yet we owe our kids a stable and healthy future we read we need to reinstate local democracy and citizen engagement the regeneration bill does not really reflect this be the regeneration and transformation of the city in an ecologically culturally socially and economically sustainable way to restore the dignity prosperity well-being and long-term resilience of people communities ecology and infrastructure the bow needs to recognize that communities need to be built up from the ground for example an idea since you asked for ideas before there 's a lot of rates on land part of the land could be provided to young people who haven 't got the means now to to buy a house in Christchurch because it 's so expensive now at and they could build tiny houses which are actually quite topical at the moment and this could be done in conjunction with the change in building rules as the Auckland City Council is done recently by allowing 40 square metres structures without building consents communities need to be enabled to request regeneration plans littleton and brighton have come a long way in this process they are very engaged communities and I think they have been rather stifled than enabled by the rebuild provisions I until now the bill needs to be consistent with the recover Recovery Minister has been far too big and we are not in a state of emergency anymore and the we really need to restrict the Crown 's involvement by transferring the power of the loading of the Earthquake Recovery Minister to the Minister of Local Government by abandoning the government 's veto rights over local decisions by restricting the crown a crown cause involvement to existing anchor projects and by making it compulsory for the minister to coincide the council the ultimate goal of the burn needs to be the active and meaningful engagement with the community only with an engaged community defined as the people who live and work here only when this community is engaged Christchurch will prosper remember thank you now members are there questions David and in there about the moment of liberty one of the newspapers described one of our members today as a boy Friday who bleeds blue and with your name I should I feel we should almost be sort of addressing you as count or Baron don 't worry about this edgeley on a serious point you say that the crown abandoning that 's Rogan add the anchor products the anchor projects what what mechanism do you see for the crown to start releasing all of the land that it 's bought in the CBD back to the community or developers if you only thought today I don 't think then lent should be released in a private sort of context that should be released as a probation for a whole community of young people to be able to build tiny houses including in the CBD leadwood sorry including in the CBD area yes if possible I mean we want to bring people into this evdo don 't be i mean i think this is one of the hallmarks of a life and a life cvd that people live in the city and I mean how do we attract those people to live here I mean only the very rich can afford it at the moment it 's not that young people have got much chance these days to actually buy houses in Christchurch let alone in the CBD or flats or whatever so we we need to make some provisions it to actually move into the CVT and the mechanism exactly how that should be sorry I can 't actually made yes thank you very much for your submission so talking about you talk about sheer idea and I think you made a comment that some of the ideas were implemented doors ready will followed up on and I 'm just trying to work through I suppose some of the narrative we 've heard over the last day or two is about people feeling as though they haven 't been heard I 'm thinking was a hundred and six thousand ideas someone suggested that maybe there happened and that exercise but do you think there might be some truth that when people 's ideas don 't get implemented they assume that their ideas haven 't_''_446.349 been heard I mean if you 've got a hundred and six thousand ideas give me a lot of people disappointed because he can 't implement a hundred success it 's totally agree with that air it is certainly a huge task to bring all those ideas together but from my own experience the reboot so far I think Christchurch hasn 't come any closer to be ecologically sustainable I mean we be still struggling with the extremely polluted waterways for example in the city and I mean there 's lots going on to address this problem but I feel and there could be actually much more done to address and ecologically socially culturally and economically sustainable city mmm well I think that 's clear I mean if you to look at christ church before these quite should argue there was a lot of stagnation leaned across a lot of syria 's hints why we need to regenerate I mean yeah I mean it seems quite obvious an old city that has grown over more than a century this in its infrastructure also very handicapped but the earthquakes actually provide an opportunity to change this totally and we have actually still the opportunity to have a world-leading city here and I think we should really make all efforts to to be an example especially in our very unstable times especially with climate change people need the reassurance that lead us to all they can to no other questions so can I on behalf of the committee thank you for taking time to be with us this morning for your written submission and for sharing your views and opinions with us before thank you very much thank you _"

Ducey that 's right there are hundreds and hundreds of bus users who feel exactly the same way but most of us don 't really want to have to come and speak to a group like this it 's just too daunting well we appreciate your doing so not good you have a quick yes I didn 't understand cure Jenna thank you for also mentioning a fine resident of Summerfield Andre leather so appreciate that yeah do you think that just talking about as a long time of work that needs to be done or incentives to be actually put forward that more people actually use public transportation and this is a real important part isn 't it or moving it forward do you agree with that I 'm forever saying this little thing to the Auckland City Council device at City Council 's we can 't do anybody I 've got all sorts of ideas of how to improve the whole thing and make it easier for people to use the buses okay including so what would be the main one in Christchurch though to incentivize more people that you think that would incentivize more people to use public transportation once the you know everything 's been sort of repaired a lot of people that come here to these that the submission process haven 't actually realized or they may be they have but they 've forgotten about seventy nine percent of the infrastructure that we don 't see has actually been completed and or with all they 're looking at and that 's below ground a lot of it so what with all of that what you 're advocating for and I completely agree that this is what needs to take place next what do you think it 's the major issue though they try and get people back on buses ask us ask the people you would like to be able to use public transport and I always sum it up as this I want to I want to be able to catch a bus when I want to catch it and where I want to like I want the bus to go where I want it to go when I wanted to do okay I mean I living at rock lucky as well there 's also you know kes Bay cool sea obey we 've been together with local residents as you know it 's interesting to try and find everyone wants the bus every every time they need it it 's just a matter of getting schedules and all that lined up sure in the cost of it okay but at the very heart of the whole trains public transport system must be the bus users none of the other things are for your submission Thank You Jenna thanks my shut up thank you thank you very much _"

    "text": "Thank You Todd carbines please good morning Todd welcome you 've been sitting there watching the process we 've got about ten minutes yours was a pleasantly brief written submission so I 'm sure that you 're now going to expand upon it that 's right welcome over to you regarding the new brighton zone part of the bill my proposal is to reduce the height of the Sandhills 2 2 to 3 meters above street level from shekel on street to the south car park and from the north car park to Thompson pack can you now look at the submission PDF the first one is reiteration of that I support the bill my submission is a shortened version of my proposal on evo space co NZ shore to shore promenade I suggest the limits to be from opposite sheridan street to thompson park supplementary PDF one is an EVO space PDF of the shore to shore promenade i had engineered seawall and paved promenade two to three meters above Marine Parade removal of sand hills and Mara grass above promenade height to provide sea views to housing along disability access along the coast potentially enhance property values of beachfront housing if I can now go to more expanded written text I grew up living on marine parade in the 1960s and 70s I now live opposite the north car park so I already have access to receive you and I 'm not proposing this for personal gain my parents grew up in North New Brighton during the 1930s and 40s at that time the genes were very low and the age of housing was relatively new sea views were certainly there from a two-story and often from a one-story house built on a previous low June section the Mara grass was imported Scotland to reduce sand blowing over the prospective northern eastern suburbs than the eighteen hundreds now they are developed and the marin grass is no longer there the Mary Grace has taken over from the native penge grass on the beachfront it has captured the sand and now the dunes are the height of power poles and three-story houses which is roughly eight meters this has played a role in the degradation of our marquee street space is that the dunes and marin grass are natural this is untrue they are man altered and unnatural thus thinking is representative of a sliding base line the oldest residents have seen the difference the Jun 's have had a negative effect on the development of new brighton and north near brighton housing stock several years ago a plan change was made to allow for high-rise development in near brighton only on marine parade this was to capture the sea views but wouldn 't have been necessary had the crisis city council kept them down over the previous 60 years in a conversation with chris freeman from the council in the mid-1990s he acknowledged that the council should have used a bulldozer after the wahine storm to fill in the 5-meter cliffs and lowering the june tops reducing blowouts the reason I proposed the shore to shore promenade on evo space was to protect the length of the populated part of Pegasus Bay coastline with a rock frontage similar but smaller than the one and sunder since the way he nice storm in the 1960s it is obvious that happened many times since then and with prospective sea level rise they will be the first thing to go as I gathers momentum above 60 to 50 centimeters of rise the modeling by the commissioner of the environment genright shows that the beach strip is higher than the land around the two river systems in East Christchurch so remediating the beach coastline is the logical option as well as building higher more permanent river banks than the temporary post-earthquake ones that are there now if I can go back to supplementary pf2 that states that the photos on the next PDF of the existing promenade and the sand dunes on either side to from the top of the Jun 's showing how far above the housing they are there are ten photographs and that PDF if the sequence is correct hopefully I can just briefly explain each photograph the first one is the north car park from the surf club end the second one is on top of the existing dunes with the surf club at center the third one is from the same spot looking down to the housing power poles and the house roofs are below this position the fourth photo is looking north from the pier over the proposed location of the Legacy Project which is the hot salt water baths that 's a proposal with the existing stone wall and promenade and that center right another hard to see the fifth photograph is looking south from the pier showing the ramp to the pier and the south car park with the dunes behind that the sixth photograph is looking north from the pier showing the north car park Surf Club and June stretching north with a seagull better take flash the seventh photograph is similar to the fourth one which was looking north from the pier just over a wider view and the eighth and last pictorial photograph is a wider view south of the pier showing how much the housing is blocked out by the jeans the three-story building barely able to see over them on the top level the photographs 9 and 10 are a cutting photograph of a cutting from the local newspaper with the last paragraph being the relevant one on photograph over Christian Bale a comment yeah we 're not going to be able to fix your problems in this you 're going to have to submit to the plan processes that follow through christchurch city try to thank you very much ya know is that the bill does say from the foreshore thus at the high level line so i consider that the dunes are part of the zone of the new brighton within the new brighton frightened boundary no I 'm not disputing it 's just we 're not getting down to that level of detail of what the new plan should say he 'll so we 're essentially looking at the at the at the governance model rather than I realized as a very early point to be time to be promoting this sort of idea I would imagine that would occur and in my getting it to do a few more times it 's a very good apprentice run Yeah Yeah Yeah right edgewood a forum may be called and different ideas what we 'd hoped you yes Todd think thank you very much appreciated none on the listing um _"

    "text": "members of the public we aren 't due to take a tea break but there is tea and stuff here and invite you to us to discreetly and at your leisure take advantage of it Susan welcome thank you sorry I might need this water idea it was recovering from a cold oh good you 're good well take time we 've got 10 minutes we 've got your written submission and you 've seen the process it 's over to you how we use that ten minutes okay well I have them written down what I want to say so I 'm apologize for reading it to you I can 't remember in my state at present I can 't keep it all of my head but firstly you thank you for coming to Christ future to listen and learn it 's much appreciated by people in the city although my submission is mine as an individual I work across the city in five different locations and from the very east and rent cliffs or actually in sumner and belong to to community groups so my range in a west of the city and in that time I meet lots of people talked a lot of lots of people and through the to community groups that I belong to I talked to many hundreds more so I decided that perhaps I could be considered as a thinking every man and so I 'm speaking for the thinking every man and my submission my written Simone submission I spoke about city 's residents having as a result of the way things have been managed and run and as a result of the earthquakes experiencing a kind of community post-traumatic stress disorder now that is from the quakes but there 's more to it than that as the previous speaker said in the heady days of mid 2011 the Christchurch City Council was charged with producing a draft recovery plan which it did by December of there year it was based on community engagement a project could share an idea and in those months with aftershocks occurring regularly and most of us fearful about buildings even citizens went into libraries halls large and tech centers and we created a hundred and collective call was for a low-rise open space dominated future-focused smart city but what we were delivered instead in July the next year by the minister and Sarah and the consortium established was a slam bam and no thank you I won 't say the next word blueprint and asset central city recovery plan full of things that actually had not been requested because they knew better a community forum was established but the minutes of the meetings were often late they frequently had large sections redacted and they were at some meetings committed to confidentiality so the public had little idea whether there was any true consultation or what was being planned whether the forum believed and what was being said and there was absolute silence to the citizens and here we are three years later with only a flu few things from The Blueprint completed when I thought about it writing this I thought actually blueprint is an appropriate color so I want to reform my tree for my written submissions description and to a different 1i of coined and I don 't say this lightly and I coined a phrase called battered citizens syndrome as i believe that this fool as formulated now will perpetuate that situation so as I speak to you I want you to imagine the implications of the present bill against their actually I 'm a very glass half-full person but of course people can only remain that if they think and they are satisfied in fact they 're very happy about that glass half full and what does actually in the glass so my submission today is about some things I am concerned about that are in the glass the glass being the second image that I asked you to reference what I say gives so the first thing I considered for the glass what is the real influence of regenerate Christchurch the explanatory note with the bill describes its purpose is supporting a vibrant thriving Christchurch that is economic social and lifestyle opportunities for residents businesses visitors investors and develops developers that of course means that three of the five groups that regenerate Christchurch has the purpose of supporting have economic imperative I think there 's something missing there regenerate Christchurch central city the red zones and possibly other identified in degreed areas regenerate Christchurch will also have to engage and advocate effectively with communities stakeholders and decision-makers to achieve its purpose it 's a purpose being of supporting and regenerate Christchurch has to collaboratively work with others in achieving regeneration section 92 of the bill and page 2 of the explanatory notes says that the bill will provide regenerate Christchurch with all the powers necessary to it achieve its purposes and purpose and objectives and to perform its functions it is to develop vision strategies to provide investment facilitation advice advice to the crowd and development Christchurch limit limited to comment on regeneration outcomes interventions and the contribution of crown company completing I add the word perhaps the anchor projects and development Christchurch limited and to provide independent advice and recommend regeneration activities to the minister and the council all noble aims but it is not a strategic partner in this build process unlike the regional council the two adjacent councils the City Council and NATO who whose views must be sought along with those of regenerate the regenerate christchurch all those bodies can propose such plans and they 're all called proponents i 'm sure you know all this at 84 in the regulatory impact statement for the bill it states that regenerate christchurch will not have delivery functions such as delivering anchor projects however all public sector agencies with delivery functions will be expected to collaborate with it and to respond to the guidance and plans at develops so we have an organization about to be set up through this plan process sorry with this through this closed process with the already pointed head christchurch is most effective delivery provider but with no delivery functions that sounds to me like being in the room as the workhorse and advising and consulting but without real power so in terms of regenerate christchurch i 'm not sure that my glass is half full the second thing i considered was what our regeneration plans the explanatory notes explained that they contain the direction in the detailed matters that need to be read a dress for regeneration in a particular area and a timely and collective way these plans can be proposed the street strategic partners regenerate christchurch the central government however just like for the first blueprint of this proposed plan unamended then the minister approves the development amendment or revocation of the plans and for the continuation of existing recovery plans there is a long process as described in the explanatory notes and clauses 16 to 23 of the boat as back and forth go the regeneration draft proposals then amendments then plans then any revocations and always the power remains with the ministers several of them and chief exec executives and several of them they can they can they can the minister can approved develop a mean suspend revoke RMA documents council plans are the documents amalgamate compulsorily acquire or dispose of land and established compensatory value continue to demolish buildings restrict access and clothes and stock roads the explanatory notes say that the minister will have particular regard to the views of the strategic partners and regenerate Christchurch and there are requirements for public input but there is no stated obligation that the minister must have particular regard to that public and put another deja vu I feel is to impact statement on page 4 at number 6 since regeneration plans will provide an expedia turd process protecting p planning and regulatory processes I suppose with the RMA and the LG out a out of the way one could argue that though I disagree has the seerat and the ccrp provided an expedia to process it appears not and of course removing the RMA and the LGA reduces citizen participation and voice and keeps the power firmly in the hands of the gatekeepers the ministers in the chief executives and until 2020 one and possibly beyond so the season are you nearly finished with yeah well and truly used our ten minutes I 'm nearly finished thirdly the new proposed bill what is it the explanatory notes say that the bill repeals the seer act and establishes powers necessary to support the regeneration of Greater Christchurch until 2021 and nice yet nine-year time gap since 2012 using those notes I explained that there are over 20 references to ways in which the new bill corresponds to the CRX it appears to be the C react and drag but powers provided to the responsible ministers and chief executives will generally need to be used in accordance with the purpose of the bill and generally must be reasonably considered necessary then the bill gives almost total power as so the earthquakes heaven last month so my conclusion the regulatory impact statement concludes that there were two thousand eight hundred submissions it says that a full summary of public feedback as expected to meet be made publicly available in the near future I want to know when at 22 29 in that statement it explains that sara is conducting a distinct project compiling important lessons learned through the response and recovery phases it will deliver a legacy of experience and practical tools to help minimize the impacts of future disasters and improve preparedness and resilience a reporter 's expected early next year personally I think they 're shows a worrying conflict of interest there should be an independent analysis of this experience in Canterbury is truly the blueprint for future disaster and there will be them in New Zealand cities and towns then it truly must be as the previous speakers Sierra and the ccrp round one and what 's proposed in this bill round two does not fit for purpose I consider Susan wicket we are going to have to wrap it up I am wrapping up so please consider harder long and what is said to you here don 't be bound by your usual party line requirements because more is needed for Christchurch and more is needed for New Zealand I remain sadly if this bill goes through convinced at the glass is half empty I think this bill needs real consideration and real reworking and I think there 's an alternative the alternative is use an amended bill if you need to but its actions must be not be inconsistent with the RMA and ND LGA and you could simply have to commissioners sitting with the Christchurch City Council as the lead agency to ensure that the dollars invested by the government worm energy Thank you Thank You Susan we appreciate your spending time with us today and for sharing your views and opinions with the committee thank you very much _"

    "text": "Oscar here is Susan Williams here oh we 're running out of someone does zero Templeton see how about we take you and then will the others may may arrive so this is Sierra Templeton who was wasn 't due until even so thank you for being early it 's all right appreciate it you 've been watching what we do we 've got about 10 minutes members have read your submission thank you very much for hearing me today it 's just a brief submission and three key points around engagement around the carrier provisions from Assyria and call for a review of the blueprint and the cost your agreement now the second point of those has been really well canvassed by the City Council and I agree with their points carryover provisions around demolition near at ministerial veto they 're not pure enough yeah it 's pretty good and thank you and not needed now there is no emergency there is no even mention of quake in the legislation and and those powers are no longer needed I 'd like to see my time however talking about engagement lot of people around the city and in the role that I have both residents and business owners and there is no sense of ownership of our rebuild currently people aren 't engaged in the process they feel completely disenfranchised from this city and the in stark contrast to the approach that was taken initially with the Sharon idea campaign where there was a sense of possibility a sense of potential a sense of ownership and our city and a reason to stay because people could see a vision for the future now when that was taken away from people and a locked room for a hundred days whether it was put in place and the blueprint came out the lack of transparency around that process leave people feeling completely disenfranchised people felt most sense of and felt like they had no reason to stay it wasn 't their city anymore the rebuild was being done to us and not with us the the Crown has shown an ability to engage when they choose there have been the odd time where they have said that they were engaging but it 't know it was happening how and they seemed to be amused at times over the the lack of sense of engagement and the rebuild one of the key things one of the things that illustrates that 's really well as the avon river precinct now the government has put a lot of money into a verb river precinct the river is looking really nice the bank is looking good it 's going to be lovely to walk around and people have talked to sarah and ccd you are completely bewildered by the lack of public positive outcry over how good this is going to be and it 's because they feel absolutely no sense of involvement in the edinburgh a precinct it 's being done the outcome may have been the same the government could have engaged with the community the community may have said exactly the same things it may have been exactly to play same plans that came out but the differences in the outcome the outcome currently looks like it will be there as a physical thing but it won 't be populated because people won that 's why process is so important one of the key parts of devon river precinct is the victoria square don 't know how many of you know that it was quite a big fuss made about the proposed changes to victoria square because it 's an area that while it was sitting on damaged land and there were some cracked tiles and uneven land it wasn 't broken and yet the government had decided to spend about seven million dollars redesigning it when people felt that it wasn 't necessary so lucky wagner directed a consultation process take place it was actually really well set our people didn 't trust it particularly because there had been this this history of things being done dead that weren 't open but it was done in good faith in a two-stage process of consultation which has ended up both giving us into more trust in that particular process but also it 's saved the government money and save the millions of dollars on the redevelopment of a piece of land that didn 't need to be done they 're going to be the people wanted they didn 't need something grand and it 's going to save the government a lot of money people need to feel ownership of their city they need to feel involved otherwise then there is no reason to stay they 've been examples overseas with the government 's have steep done and done large builds large quick bills and the cities have died because the people weren 't involved it was done to them and not with them so I 'll leave that but there and go through to the cost year in the blueprint now that the blueprint came out with a lot of fanfare and for nearly four years ago by the time that the the change in legislation takes place so by April next year we 'll have had five years since the major earthquake will have had four years of the blueprint and it 's time to review it any large business around the world that wants to be successful reviews its plans on a regular basis it goes what was my plan how are we tracking is it still fit for purpose successful and we need that with our rebuild as well so even in a purely economic sense if we want our city to be successful not only do we need to engage we need to review the blueprint we need to see whether those particular anchor projects and other things we need to look at accessible City and livable city and see whether that 's still fit for purpose if if the review that the rebbe you shun was garroted can only have a positive outcome if the review finds that the current blueprint and arrangements in place are fit for purpose and are still going to give us a successful rebuild then that will build confidence and the rebuild it will withdraw investment when people are currently not trusting if the review shows that the blueprint needs adjusting in some way then those adjustments can be done and build confidence in the rebuild and draw investment and I would argue that that needs to be entrenched in the legislation and that a time frame needs to be given in the legislation for a review once a review of the cost your agreement because they will be probably likely drew changes need you doing and I think that needs to be in the legislation otherwise it won 't open and that 's what I have to say they everything is now I think use your knees got a question um thank you Sarah s cheer of the Hagley pyramid community board can you just talk about how the board process of engagement works because we we 've heard from a lot of submitters about the lack of voice and it 's what model should be used to get good consultation good engagement so is it the local government act and is that the best model work in terms of the this practice was with community engagement and yeah the local government act is really good and clear and directing that we consult but you can do many different things within these in Christ it 's just showing lots of different models and from the different models used by the transitional city groups so get fella greening the rubble in their community engagement and to the ones that the local governing council council processes are still quite there is like the formal process our council goes through but it 's changing to be much more of a grassroots one going whether people are rather than calling them into you and those kind of things having a much wider range of people involved focusing on youth currently we 've just an a community board plan and there 's a real focus on getting the voice of youth and development of our area and I 've been really really successful just like to point out that it 's a personal submission though it 's just a naive that experience yeah sure Todd 's got a question thank you you referenced the process that Nikki Wagner it 's a lead could you just add to that a lot from Christ chips I 'd be just interested in a noble little bit more understanding what went on there and why you thought it was so successful yeah so I 've done several things which have been successful in this case and the first thing was that one that when the planes came out and showed going to be a big flat wide open space so Marcus and things could be held there was an outcry people like Victoria Square people already hold markets in it even though it 's not flat because because I see because I does a nice people centered space so she held a meeting on site of people who were interested people who had emailed her office and talk to them about the plans and the potential and after that conversation said ok so we will engage properly it was a two-stage process the first one was at online and fill in form I think that and where people could say what they would like to see in Victoria 's for ya so it was more of a start from scratch at which point people didn 't trust it particularly because they had been this history there for my conversations with people and syren city to you it was in good faith and from that it was very clearly from from the toner to an about thousand papers that came back and online it was really clear that people liked the were very very low the list of possible activities and so a draft was designed based on that which was very very close to the original or the current design the 1987 design one mistake that was made I think was that they asked people to come to them for the edge your personal interactions as had a consultation process they had a shipping container the future Christ which contain and restart more which is more populated by terrorists and and not the sort of residence that they asked people to come to that two different times and into not huge and I think they 're actually going to out to more of the markets around town would have been really good go to people places with people who really for such so I I was involved in another way so they well they did they set up a independent community reference group to oversee the process to me to help build trust in the process and I was asked to cheer that group and I as an individual member of that group rather than the consultation team blog to successful got a mean but this easy do staff along as well and we had the planes and feedback forms and we engage with a lot of people went on line 8 thiet honor on a Saturday morning which was really good the second stage was people coming to convert draft and sear on that note we need to draw the submission to a close but thank you very much very useful and Inc thanks for taking the time to be with us on the set of they want to appreciate it thank you very much now _"

    "text": "to the table sit nearly right Thank You Donna welcome you 've seen the prices we 've got about 10 minutes we 've got your written submission and you can assume that we 've read it okay great thank you again my name is Donald preggers and I am a chartered professional engineer that specializes in geotechnical engineering I am a resident of New Zealand and I 've been in Christchurch here now for nearly four years first let me state that I personally support the general direction of the legislation with his aim to return to local governance and leadership and the focus on the regeneration of the CBD the residential red zone and New Brighton I 'm not going to reread the previous the middle as I 've seen you already have it but rather I 'd like to focus and use my time to elaborate on my concern that the structure of the bill will add layers of bureaucracy and government intervention rather than reduce it and direct the leadership of the regeneration to the local community where I feel it belongs it 's interesting to note government 's 18 anchor projects have been completed a number have been cancelled almost every project has been delayed last month the Press reported over 75 percent of the citizens here in Christchurch feel that there 's a strong through sip there 's a lot of real strong vision for leading the city and the regeneration process here last week as the treasurer 's report has been talked about before it came out there was released that the anchor project delivery appears unachievable and that the over by overall viability of the projects might need to be reassessed in regards to the residential program residential red zone program it was reported that the successful delivery of the project was in doubt and that urgent action was needed to determine whether a resolution could be found the bottom line is that extensive resources have been spent by ccd you and Sarah with only marginal positive outcomes for the city at this point accordingly there 's widespread distrust and the government 's leadership of the central city and its plans for large parts of city-owned city now owned by the crowd including end zone it is important to note that this is that the development of this is primarily a large urban planning project one that needs to be embraced and supported by the Christchurch local community this process that directs the plan needs to be driven by the local community and not the crowd because it 's the local people here that are going to be living in it and residing in it it 'll be here for the next years to come for our children on that topic I have first-hand knowledge where capital resources and technical knowledge were squandered on at least one of the key anchor projects because of the sara LED process that was utilized for tendering as a result there is a reluctance from the purse string holders of capital and resources to speculate and apply resources to develop lands that may develop plans that may just be shopped around this opinion was reiterated in the referenced Press article on the treasury report where i believe it was city councilor mr. lonsdale was quoted as saying the private sector has decided to crack on in some out of the ground but there 's a large chunk of investors who won 't do anything until the anchor projects are underway I am personally familiar with tried tested and proven processes to transfer public land to private development interests that partner with local governments to plan develop and build successful local communities there 's a significant investment of time and money involved in developing master plans in collaboration with the community that also works financially and that 's why only sophisticated experienced financially capable development company can do it I really don 't believe the crown Karen and I don 't believe that federal government should be in the development business the was the best way to encourage such development company to invest time and energy and financial resources is to work with the community to develop a thoughtful broadly responsive land plan is to enter into an exclusive agreement that is transparent widdly select a developer who has done this successfully before and there are many successful precedents of this throughout the world I submit that it would be advantageous to source advice from some of the parcels of urban land while this is a large project for a new zealand it has been done successfully elsewhere with the right structure in place utilizing these or similar processes will provide the private investment the necessary assurances to invest and develop the necessary master land plan that is required for the successful development of the red zone and new brighton and other parts of the central business district and these these are plans everything that the citizens of christchurch will embrace because they 'll be engaged in the process I feel it is imperative that to regenerate bill be structured to encourage this level of partnership and not get bogged down in the business as usual procurement processes that have been used currently that sarah has utilized and as a result there has been many delays in the anchor projects thank you thank you John pool festival full presentation you said that the crown shouldn 't be a property developer I tend to agree with you but don 't you think in this particular instance in spite of reluctance the Crown has obliged to have involvement in those providing a lot of the funding for there I guess where I 'm coming from with that is that members of the crown are not land planners they are not you know under sterile truly understand the purse string processes that deal with land planning and the financial viability of various aspects of projects and that 's why you need to have a development company that works in concert with government to make these plans work and go out and do successful interactions with local communities to understand their aspirations to understand what they want can graded in the plan and then the developer who 's used to doing this kind of thing and say okay this is what this is going to cost this is what this will cost okay pick and choose the various things that you want because it 's a give-and-take process that has to happen when you do a pasture land plant like this thank you David Parker and the engineer turned from the hotel that I 'm staying and that requires me to walk through the CBD back to let him ask where and there that yeah we 've got a we 've got a wasteland but we seemed still to be in respect of the CBD air which seems to me the challenges to that are quite different to the former red zone land or to the red zone and and indeed to the New Brighton project that we still haven 't crept how we 're actually going to make progress in the CBD and although you say you make those comments and respect of the red zone land and the New Brighton am I correct to say that we pass this bill and we go forward with the structures that have been proposed and we 're still not going to fix the CBD issues well I think that you know early on there was in reference to the one project that I say a personal experience with one of the it 's this convention center yeah consortium that I was involved with that part of the process with that was basically it was to master plan the entire the entire northern half of the CBD as part of the convention center deal big building the people can come and collaborate at in the convention center but it was an integrated process to look at the whole thing and make it to bring it all together and get the aspirations the community involved as well but but to master plan that whole thing rather than just plunk a building in a hotel and call it a day and that got shopped around and consortium dropped out like Thea four of the five dropped out and you ended up negotiating with one and that 's that 's the reference that I 'm making you but yeah I agree there 's izle there 's lots of empty space out there and this all has to be integrated New Brighton cannot be done by itself because Villa money wants to go to New Brighton is going to look and say okay where are all the people are going to have to drive through to get there and am I going to invest millions of dollars into New Brighton and not happen and basically have nothing in between and saying with Christchurch potential business just it all well given that it does have to be thought out if the proposed stretches that we are looking at under this bill for these regenerate Christchurch blends and the appropriate mechanism waters well I think the right now the structure it seems that you 've got a veto power you 've got got crown going to kind of IC it is almost kind of ride rule over this probably use the same procurement processes as before and people are going to outside investors are going to be reluctant to come in I think we need to open it up and force it more to the get more public involvement so so you 're actually talking about the yeah the council 's and various submitters have come along and said well look you know ministers shouldn 't have rights a veto and respective regeneration plans but what you talking about is actually the process that the crown uses in respect of the crown contributions to these anchor projects which is the process that they use through crammed code to presumably liaise with the regenerate Christchurch plan that 's been written for 't worked as what I 'm trying to say the process right now of the current process that sarah has hasn 't really worked and it seems like this bill is just to repeat your regurgitation of that same price okay so given that this bill is going to go through and similar form to that which it sets now in all likelihood if you were advising those who take power under these structures that are being legislated through this build how would you achieve the outcome that you want and could you achieve it through those structures I think it needs to have less Crown involvement than it currently because it shouldn 't be the crown needs to basically got the land and they 've got some money and resources and they can use their power to help force things to happen but they shouldn 't be the decision maker it 's the final decision makers honest now it should be I think it should be pushed to the local communities and then eventually whoever they bring it as the developers to help plan the second last quick question a lot of issues in a very young thoughtful and interesting way is there I think what you 're asking for is a an ability to do these master plans for particular areas is the legislation overseas that has a good concept that we could look to to include some of the elements in this bill because at the moment there 's no provision under the local government act all the Resource Management Act really doing I think the Master Cleanse that you were talking about I don 't think that there is the way of currently structured in it and that needs to be done it needs to be and and to do it properly you need to engage the community and get their aspirations and their needs and there 's desires and it needs to be a process to incorporate all their into it can you give any jurisdictions obviously as you said you 've been involved in a number of projects yeah in basically in San Francisco there has been there 's been military bases that have closed and those lands have been somewhat blighted which granted they 're oceanfront or waterfront properties they have similar soil conditions that we have here in Christchurch where I 've got liquefiable soils on sup materials and these developments are a similar size as what we 're talking about here in terms of land mass and the process was is if the federal government owned the land through a process that I talked about here they transfer that land to the local government who then partnered with a developer and then they generated a master plan for that development and now it 's gone forward Thank You Don thanks very much useful submission appreciate your taking the time to leave Thank You Oscar up _"

    "text": "Thank You mr. chairman and members of the Select Committee am I I want to talk quickly about several things and add to what I had written um we need to look at the purpose of the legislation again I think it needs to acknowledge the fact that the needs to be an agreed hand over time for central government to local government now Christchurch City Council and the government are equal partners paying for regenerate Christchurch and should have equal say now I 'm aware that there will be an argument that the government 's put a huge amount of money in and we 're extremely grateful for that and we expect to pay our but when another city experiences this however we 're giving to the next stage and it 's really important I 'm aware that six of you hereunder Minister Brownlee 's orders we know what that 's like we 've had that oh it is an intact with with respect that 's an entirely inappropriate comment and I 'd ask you to withdraw it a whirl I withdraw Dana key but that 's been our 's really important that the government and the city look at becoming at this becoming a 21st century city and it will only occur when we legislate for authentic and active engagement with communities and at this at this stage I don 't think that 's possible in this bill I 'll give you an example I 'm on a committee that merely and delzell has put together to look at the council 's budget there are five of us on that committee including myself a number of you will know Roger bread she sits there with us with me we are looking at reduction of hundreds of millions of dollars off the council budget and we 're doing it by linking into our networks and our knowledge and we 're doing that as volunteers and I 'm sure that you could actually use that example and every single challenge of the city and when I was aware mr. chairman afterwards that you somebody contacted me he was watching this on livestream about Tamaki and your experience and tabaqui I wasn 't_''_144.09 I had no idea about the background to there 's some very good wording there and some commitment to engagement and that 's that 's what we think is missing here now one of the important really important things is that this transition has to if you pick up the you know it 's transitioning from central government to local government to engagement or the local community and I didn 't know about the council 's submission tool before I think it 's really important that you look at the local government egg and look at how this can be linked into the local government debt and I think it needs to be a seamless transition from this bill into the local government deck I work with it for a number of years and I know it quite well and also under the local government act there are no powers of veto so as mere I actually was was the first amongst equals and I think it 's really important in any decision making process that it 's transparent and equal and that 's really important when you 're engaging properly with your community and I feel very projects only this is where the government has a significant investment this is where we a number of us have tried to get financial information on those projects and they are redacted which seems to be whole weird invented recently and and so we can 't actually look at it there is no transparency and and all sorts of polity you know arguments like commercially sensitive and things out there but really as a city we could add value to all of those projects given an opportunity and so you listening to my submission Thank You Todd and endo first thing you gave a good example before you the system with others on the Finance Committee is that engagement is that prescribed anywhere under the local government and now it was it 's approved by council passed through council process I guess my point is that you don 't need prescriptive legislation to create mechanisms for people to feel that they can come forward and have an idea both as an individual and the community and as I look at this bill I don 't see where the community is forward through to the various partners involved in this bill being strategic partners or the council themselves your comment on it um under the local government deck there 's no power of veto I don 't think this should be one and yes people can get engaged but our experience in the last five years has been a done go far as you look forward appreciated view but obviously we 've heard a lot people who have a number of ideas quite some of them sound pretty exciting and as I look at the spill with fresh eyes I don 't see why and how they are constrained from from holding that view in fact as it feels like the squadra momentum out there around people to put forward views on how to use the red zone land and and the like and one would assume that those who sit around the regeneration board will be able to reflect on that and I know that no doubt that will be part of their deliberation i think that to me that the offensive piece is the power of veto and i and central government and the local community should be seen as equals and i don 't think that 's written under this bill and our experience as a city and I know the experience of the council has been under the sea wreck they are not equal now I 'm not saying the council 's celestial virgins either I think they need some significant viewing of how they go about things and that 's the committee that group of us are on that 's what we 're doing David you concede that where the government is spending a lot of the government 's money they should be able to control how the money is spent and you think that that 's effectively limited to the big projects through crown co yeah this seems to be a from questions of the committee to members a theme coming through from government members of the committee this is no criticism of them that that same need for control permeates the regenerate christchurch plans as well do you have a view as to whether there is whether that 's necessary no i don 't the city and if you stand on the top floor of our business and look around at the empty land you can see that in fact public see and should never ever have anything to do with property development and and that is our my observation that in fact the property people that are engaged in this are actually working as servants to public servants and that model is wrong and so am i I think that you know penny and Bruce and others have said we 've got to have transparent processes that engage actively in the community sometimes that slower but regularly my experience has been it 's cheaper because a local I 've been involved in a number of major projects where when we engage for the local community they said look you 're doing it wrong and and we changed how we were doing it but engagement point yeah I 've got that done but in terms of the issue as to whether there should be ministerial veto powers and respect of the regenerate Christchurch part of this bill I might be missing something but I have a right of veto in there do you know that 's equal partners are putting in equal amounts and the council may put may increase its share and be putting in more than central government afterwards so in fact leaving the minister 's power of veto and as offensive so regenerate Christchurch plans can 't spend the government 's money anyway can they know so why do they need a power of veto I 'll put it this way if I were me or I 'd be jumping up and down but I 'm not so I 'm jumping up and down as a citizen we were running very short of time Eugenie and then so I mean this legislation draws heavily on the syrah aid if instead it used its model is a local government act would appeal rights the environment court and the normal RMA processes provide that check and the transparency for the planning process instead of the ministerial better yes and the beauty of appeal rights look I 've been involved on decisions that have been over ten by higher courts and they improved them one of the things that is quite complicated for many individuals as being able to afford that appeal but our community can go Gary I just want to come to your legislate for authentic connective engagement and use again the the Tamaki development as an example do you think that in the legislation because when we look at the cultural and put of its we 're just talking about NATO who now I know that you 're qualified enough you with your relationship with EE we do you think that it should be wider to actually include sort of more ethnicity like Pacific your net like they do with the Tamaki development yeah that 's the bit that really appealed to me because I I work on a whole lot of cultural communities in Christchurch and in fact Marc Solomon I put together the intercultural assembly and that made some major decisions for the city we had that United Nations we could call on it 's really important to have that I think it 's important to have tanga defender but it 's also important to acknowledge the other ethnicities you Gary thank you very much for your submission useful as always thank you thank you _"

    "text": "um penny Carnaby plays did penny do you have Christina with you or not not just the well if Christina wants to come and laugh to the table she 's most welcome goody thanks we weren 't quite sure how to yeah got it is my agendas got one name but the submissions got toes oh yeah that 's right um well look Kurt welcome you know the process we 've got the robot the submission go for it yep I mean I think the first thing is basically in a slight apology at the brevity of our submission like every one we have been in the middle of moving from a very damaged house to a new house in the last couple of weeks and so I think what I want to do is the essence of our submission is really to try and and and look freshly at what 's happening in Christchurch and and you will hear a lot about the need two more meaningfully engaged community to bring a more authentic voice and add to the City Council and at the moment i think the what disconnect between wellington and christchurch and just to give you a bit of my own background just to show you that I too was part of the dark side of Wellington I was heading a government department for eight years and towards the end with the first Christchurch earthquakes I was actually in Wellington so I saw how swift the response was I wonder if we could fault it really and in terms of what the government of the day tried to do and so I 'm not critical of that at all but what once i returned to christchurch and we started getting better life back here i was absolutely horrified with how disconnected wellington bureaucrats were with actually what was going on and the ground here in christchurch and people that have been previous colleagues there was a certain kind of known ness and arrogance in terms of you know what was actually going on for Joe citizen and and the council and and I think we 're seeing this you know I don 't diss previous colleagues but I actually think this is this is an issue got to learn from Christchurch for the rest of New Zealand and I think you 've been presented with a very very sloppy bill it 's poorly drafted it speaks of bureaucrats in complete isolation from what I think you know quite a an optimistic and their issues around it in in terms of the power of the minister and those things which are deeply dispiriting but I do think that a fresh look it looks very much I think like the state 's error legislation and I I think members from both sides of the house has been let down in this draft so what are some of the solutions you know how do we engage the community voice and what does that mean I think we you know we should be encouraged actually if you look at the early days of recovery around you asked about whether there had been some real consultation well I have to say the the tens of thousands of people who contributed to the share an idea campaign quite soon after the earthquake the citizens of Christchurch of Greater Christchurch developed a vision is to deliver than some of the you know the bigger business solutions that for the central city it was an idea for regeneration that focused on a much broader agenda than has been the case on the environment on the social issues on the cultural issues and and it you know there if we let the citizens voice rip I think you would we would find something that was truly inspirational the we just cannot go on with this this disconnect from from what we 're presented with and with the ministerial pars it it simply will SAP any a development either economic or social and I think I 'd really urge you to look at a balance there we should feel encouraged maybe with maybe the shift should be to the local government minister away from me the minister for earthquake you know that may address some of the balance so the issues around local government and the issues that and the broader issues the other we 've had have had a brief look at the the Tamaki regeneration programme and while I 'm not deeply knowledgeable about looked at something that that is genuinely a partnership of target FN aware of community and of central government so that may be something for you to look at a bit more deeply as I say I haven 't_''_374.86 and and just to give you an example we live and it was where an example of where local government the council engaged with the people of a very very broken part of Christchurch we were consulted week after week and we 've come up you know we put together with the council we 've come up with some some developments knock you would know this your area to where we feel very proud of what we 've achieved and I don 't believe its cost any more so in summary and t know that the new york to had anything around around the the the visions the visions that are put before us are are at a mega big business scale but what seems to be missing from the vision is the more personal community scale small to medium medium businesses don 't seem to have a place in what think we 're seeing that I suppose I 'm saying find a solution that gets the voice of the people we will do it for you I mean I 'm finished with this we do not want another headline like this the witches the avon river is polluted and and it 's absolutely disgusting it doesn 't need to be there are visions for the avin the city to the see that where where thousands of us will come and and and and have a living corridor that the whole of New Zealand will be be proud of you know while we 're arguing about red zone things getting a commercial game back from land it 's it 's ludicrous that land should never be built on again so the essence of our submission is address their balance move from the the powers of the minister get a decent piece of legislation drafted restore some of the manor and connection of the council with the people of Christchurch and most important me hear our voice so thank you thank you both very much one quick question I hope we have you for your submission again it there are some unique things in there but it 's interesting how many other submitters have brought up the Tamaki development you know as an example that the government was already working with so that 's first thing I think the other thing which was interesting is with the little too poor company handles so he can how they 'll working together on that development plan but coming from littleton as you do you know the are they working in unison actually with the development of the community just just one other thing though that are you aware you 're probably not but yesterday these Christchurch City Council 's submitted and what they were talking about is a sort of in addition to this or a to integrate obviously more of community collaboration you know within this sort of built so that 's what you 're asking for well that 's the essence I think of what your submission is and interesting with your Picard or you 're at the beginning where you said that when you 're in up in Wellington you know you got here it 's actually and we 're hearing this all the time so I mean your submission as I think a really again something that we 're hearing quite a lot around collaboration so it wasn 't a question I 'm sorry I was going to get that from you yesterday you had a lovely yes your other point was there 's too much power being kept with the minister and not devolved to the council did you write and I also think that you 've got a very sloppy piece of legislation in front of you and also the fact that we move it from the minister of earthquake recovery to minister of local governments were here any last quick fish on timers proud of what is being developed in Littleton is that the process with the Littleton are the local community board or is that the little support recovery plan that you 're talking about being powerful the early days with the council and the community board it not report recovery know that that was a little level problematic to be honest and I think we both very much for taking time to share your x-ray bus we appreciate it thank you _"

    "text": "come add a page or two for my submission yesterday and I don 't know if it 's gone through yes yes okay thank you Bruce you know the process we 've got two months over to you so thank you and thank you for around taking my submission know this morning certainly like to be brief and dumb and happy to answer questions just and I won 't talk through the whole submission at all on the question of purposes one of the purposes stated there 's enabling community participation and the planning of the regeneration of Greater Christchurch but the bill doesn 't really support their purpose so that 's a fundamental problem that I 'd ask you to to really think about turning the page to their about a section on principles the which I consider is really important and is missing from this bill I 've outlined just for possible principles to include in the Bill of a suggested good faith which I think people in Christchurch might provide a lot of support for that inclusion of said transparency is another public participation as a as not had public participation and we 've not had much accountability and transparency is vital and turning the page have talked about public participation and I know others have talked about it and have provided there a copy of the eye apt spectrum and the reason it provided that is because people talk about engagement in the blah blah blah and frankly all of the engagement we have seen us of the inform consult side write down the end the left-hand side doesn 't mean a hell of a lot and doesn 't bring the people in we need to collaborate far more far far more and and that 's one of the things that 's really been missing in Christchurch I have been involved in one or two things I I don 't come from the public sector I come from the private sector and I 've been astounded when I become involved in several public matters absolutely astonished I didn 't quite realize it worked like this that I 'm learning fast and one of the things that I got involved in was providing if you like some conclusion and the response to that was incredibly poor and I 'm happy to go into it if you like but but what are the conclusion i came to is that this city and every city has got enormous capability skills resources experience residing in the community but it is so hard for that to contribute in christchurch desperately needs it there are skills out there unbelievable skills and networks and if you try and contribute the pushback from the bureaucracy is astonishing and I 'm not talking here about minor stuff with vested interests what I got involved in was a major exercise and the dollars are phenomenally large so it 's not about me having a vested interest saying I want this for me nothing like that at all the pushback astonishing and so I 'm not alone there are hundreds in every city that that can participate I mentioned section 12 proponent and the proponents of basically government institutions or local body institutions bring the people into it that is absolutely essential we have had planning 34 years of planning getting nowhere avoid the people you get get the nonsense that accountability is via Parliament of the council accountability the prime accountability should be back to the citizens and then I just want to attend to to what I talked what I add it and a section on planning and I deliberately hadn 't included this when i submitted because I talk there about two very well known and leading academics Daniel Kahneman Noble and Nobel Prize winner in economics and and bent Fleur via a Danish economist now our Danish plan who is now at Oxford University and he sees some really interesting things and the two of them have worked together in recent years and I note the array a lecture and I 'm happy to provide the full notes of that lecture of the committee are interested but he talks about the planning problems of of mega projects and I see I posed an email question to him a few days ago I said this is the situation in Christchurch how does this relate to your research on mega projects which across the world and just disastrous in terms of cost overruns time overruns it fits right and that was his response and I won 't go right through it you can read that but he talks in his own words about Machiavelli 's formula and he says the game gets played like this you underestimate the costs you overestimate the revenues you under and value the environmental impacts you overvalue the development effects and you do all of that stuff the bureaucracy does all of that stuff and they get funding and then you sit back and you go well that 's not a very good project and we 've seen that and some of the planning we 've seen it in the convention center complete nonsense that 's going on with the convention center we 've seen it and other things and so the final point just in the submission of put their four instruments of accountability from FLIR beer and transparency as one of them specifying performance getting very clear on that the regulatory regime and the rest capital in conclusion I 'd just like to say that the there is the conclusion our counters there 's one leverage point the local government is the issue of transparency there is not transparency you try and get information and you just don 't get it there 's every bit of hindrance Under the Sun and these reasons for that lack of transparency some of the documentation should not be provided because it 's not good after we need to change the game in terms of transparency transparency we need to put principles in this bill so that people actually understand what sort of what regeneration should look like first thank you very much we 've got time for us and probably one quick question you gentleman is there any ad consultation process citizen cooed and christchurch which meets the spectrum of public participation which you would consider a good example no anymore in my view I can 't answer that let 's restrict ourselves to Christchurch my hands would be no we thank you very much and thank you for the additional material which is interesting and thanks for spending time with us this morning we do appreciate coming on the Saturday thank you _"

    "text": "morning hello and welcome we 've got about 10 minutes we 've got your written submission and it 's safe to assume that members have read it yep and as I 've indicated to term over to you how we use the ten minutes but the more of it you spend talking to us the least we 'll have to talk with you ok welcome once again ok thank you I 've tried to speak to the main thrust of my submission in about five minutes and hopefully that will leave some time for questions good so as you may know my name is Helen lo I 'm a private citizen I 'd very much prefer not to be here today but I am so concerned with the course of events in Christchurch over the past five years that I feel I have no choice but to both make a submission and appear in person as I say in my submission although you cannot legislate for leadership and vision I believe these directly connected qualities are what christ church where the one talks in terms of recovery or regeneration has who has and is publicly articulating a vision of what our city 's future could look like who is not only actively asking for our views and taking them seriously when we give them but proactively seeking ways for citizens to be engaged in building that future what and where is the vision for regeneration and shrine in this bill in reading through it I see the retention of a lot of what were meant to be emergency powers and an almost exclusive focus of regeneration and bricks and mortar tombs but no comparable commitment to rebuilding the city 's fragmented communities or facilitating a high amenity livable environment I believe the bill should place a clear duty on those charged with power under it to actively facilitate a vision for the city 's future one based on meaningful consultation and actively engaging with and seeking to draw together the city as a community this is the resilience referred to under the definition of regeneration but almost nowhere else although lip service is given to consultation with the community throughout the bill the language about how the outcomes of consultation the implication appears to be consult and then ignore unless it suits and after five years of being shut out of any meaningful contribution to the future of our city I believe it is time for real regeneration and that respect the amendments I have suggested are intended to ensure consultation is real and taken seriously not just window-dressing one of the most important areas for such consultation to occur is over the future of the red zone areas I say consultation advisedly because I accept that there will be a large number of matters for decision makers to consider nonetheless i believe the aspirations of the christchurch community should be an important part of those considerations and fully taken into account and that the bill should ensure that this occurs one outstanding lack of consultation and engagement as the imposition of order 2014 and the request church replacement district plan the process is rigidly formal and highly legalistic to an extent that is intimidating for most citizens and very difficult for them to engage in without expert or legal assistance in addition the time frames are so truncated that dispensed with and the whole process is so rushed and pressured for everyone involved that it is difficult to see how it can possibly deliver high quality outcomes for christchurch as if that were not enough it is costing a huge amount of money entirely paid for by the christchurch ratepayer despite our having no say at all in the decision to expend that money so my final point is the need for normalization at this bill is truly about regeneration for christchurch then i believe it also needs to be about normalization acknowledging that the emergency of five years ago has passed and now not in another five years for Christchurch to recalibrate to the rest of the country in terms of governance and the rights of its citizens I feel very strongly that the most important of these rights as that have access to justice particularly through rights of merits based appeal on the matters set out under section 16 243 of the bill as well as ensuring that plans and policies that have been through a legitimate public process should not be able to be set aside of merits based appeal is that it enables factual matters to be tested and tribunal such as the Environment Court that are much more accessible for citizens whereas the High Court is beyond the reach of most people this is even more important in such a rushed and high-pressure decision-making environment as I 've said in section 15 on page seven of my submission the removal of rights such as merit-based appeal that are normal unusual and any other part of the country is an injustice against the Christchurch community we have already endured the trauma of the earthquakes and their consequences I do not believe we have done anything to deserve the additional trauma of the sweeping removal of our rights as citizens perpetuating this injustice and social trauma for another five years there 's no basis for regeneration nor does it suggest a true regard for the well-being of the Christchurch community community now it may be that you tell yourselves when deliberating on my submission that you can 't make an omelet without breaking eggs but since this committee is the only recourse that this particular egg the earthquakes have done quite enough Breaking already thank you very much and that regeneration should in every respect possible be about restoring normalcy not perpetuating the regime 's of emergency and crisis and in terms of the 16 billion very aware of that but I 'd also like remind people of the words of Augustine of Hippo almost 2,000 years ago that charity is no substitute for access to justice thank you very much thank you Helen no David 's good question yeah thank you for that can I recommend that you submit on a bill that 's out for consultation on proposed changes to the RMA which you know your points about appeal rights and loss of Justice I think a very very pertinent to their can I come back to your your your belief that some of the emergency planning processes that we 've got going under the prison tender proposed under this bill are you are you aware of whether the you know the you know the fast-track process that 's been headed by justice Henson at the moment at whether they 're sitting just sequentially than one I believe they 've now got Jessica 's just to get it through I 've got several different tribunals yeah it seems that that was probably necessary from the start really because although because one of the you know the feelings of injustice that you 're talking about it probably in part because the tribunal he 's just doing what they 're told I 'm so pressured that they need to work it through in a short period of time that no one really gets much hearing time it 's just a nightmare I mean you know I got caught up at because of my property you know tc3 still not repaired cap full nine yards and you know I just couldn 't believe it the first time I went there it was just failings as lawyers and experts and people like me sitting down fire into the room trying to figure out what on earth it was all about and where we could fit in and you know all the cell origin to summer ah you get where you make your evidence but then you get 10 and and in the meantime is that it 's like it 's like a free-for-all there 's all this is quite of negotiating you know you put your submission in and then you think you 'll be heard but then you suddenly get all these emails flying around and you realize all the passes and the ghost gating frantically and what you 've submitted in is already changing and no one 's even spoken to you you know the council and the crown and all the big players all kind of in there and people individual people you know you just get email after email after email with all this material and trying to even keep checking I 've just had so many people say to me like I tried to look at it for my house what it meant you know all that stuff and I just gave up I just gave up didn 't understand that doesn 't feel confident about participating and I just think invicta can feel that your rights could be infringed but you 've got no real one of those I have no idea for my property i don 't know whether it means you know that 's going to be taken away from me or something 's going to be built through it or whatever and i just can 't keep track of this and so people just give up and I think I don 't see the regeneration and that and I don 't_''_588.66 I have no confidence in the outcome of this process is delivering a city that I want to continue to live in it and maybe I 'm the wrong kind of egg for the omelet maybe that 's the message but um you know it it 's kind of it really does feel like another trauma on top of everything we 've already been through and we 've used the time allocated to us so I 'm sorry we 're going to need to keep going because if we get through today it needs to be very quick well but I 'm but unfinished or other submitters who have submitted previously and who are yet to come Helen could you just qualify yourself for the committee and in could you provide what you said today to the committee and could you just conta questioners could you contrast the district plan process with your involvement and regional other district plan processes under the RMA and the relative benefits of the normal process well there 's a very long time ago but yes I can try okay thank you Thank You Helen appreciate you taking time to be with us this morning and thanks for your written submission as well which was very detailed okay thank you bring _"

    "text": "like light finisher we ah good good good good ok so our meeting has reconvened we 've got through the submissions through until just after one o 'clock so let 's get into it and if we could have Timothy elder to the table as Timothy here welcome Timothy you at timaru Timothy term term good to have you here thank you for coming in on a Saturday morning we 've got about 10 minutes you can assume that members have read the written submission you 've provided yep over to you how we use the ten minutes but the more of it you 've been talking to us the least we 'll have to question you so good morning and welcome once again cool happy for discussion afters would be good sure yes so just a quick summary of my submission I 'm going to just talk very briefly about the the submission itself tell you a little bit about me my perspective looking at this particular document and then you tell you about why I think it 's a bit odd I guess so my submission was based in particular the veto powers the ability to suspend amend or revoke RMA documents kelso players and other documents continuing that on from the last five years for another five years so I 'm a I 'm a game designer what I do is design games clearly and it 's one of the most misunderstood roles this even misunderstood within the industry as well so I 'll tell you a little bit about what it actually actually involves it 's not designing graphics or necessarily programming but what I do is I evaluate game choices game design choices and I determine what the implications of those game design choices are all right so and game designers is defined as a series of interesting choices right or games but defined as a series of interesting choices by Sid Meier more broadly a set of rules and conditions okay so you 've got think of think of chess chess is not the pieces on the board will the board itself doesn 't matter whether it 's word or plastic or glass or a piece of paper with a little symbol drawn on in the conditions and there and the victory conditions and what each thing can do what each thing is able to do and those those are the rules of the game and when you change the rules of the game you change how players play the game they 're going to make different choices when you 've got different rules so when I look at this particular legislation in particular that their veto power that veto power is going to shift how people play the game people go to Canterbury I think we probably all agree that what we want people who are planning so NGOs council communities when they 're making plans and putting together plans we want them to be focused on making sure that those plans create the best outcomes for Canterbury to make canterbury christ church communities as good as possible and how can those plans do that that should be the primary top priority so when I look at this this change in the rules or it 's in fact continuing those rules what I see those powers doing is changing that focus changes those Canterbury awesome are going to have to pragmatically and rationally consider instead how do I make sure that these planes don 't get vetoed by the government okay they 're going to be focusing on on that because they 're going to need to because if the if the minister has the power to just say no that 's not going to happen that that 's going to completely throw away huge amounts of work huge amounts of constantly and presumably you know council NGOs are rum consulting with stakeholders community whoever might actually have an have an interest in it and that 's huge amounts of work and for the the minister be able to say from now that 's that 's going to diminish that though we 're also going to be concerned about how they protect their goals and dreams from of the minister suspending those plans just not suspending it just missing it or even amending it changing it that may or may not still hold the the core principles of the plans and what they 're trying to achieve so functionally what that does is but central government a bottleneck filter and the recovery process because everything has to get through that so when you change the rules of the game you change how people play the game I 've been doing a little bit of research on this online and I found this group of people who seem to really support and shared my concerns based on what they say they value what they say they value is a place that creates opportunities for all New Zealanders to reach their personal goals and dreams they value loyalty to our country and its democratic processes they value individual freedom and choice which is a little bit undermined by this veto they also value limited government not putting government in the way between people and their their goals and their outcomes and I really support those values I think those values are awesome I really wish somebody in Parliament actually helped those values which is where I get a little bit confused because that was from the National Party website so i 'm going to say here when i see what somebody says we could spare they value and i look at some of these actions that contradict those values right pushing or this veto power i have to go on the side of what the actions are well what are people doing not what are people saying so yeah my question is if the government truly supports that truly support the democratic values that they themselves say they value are they actually going to support that in their actions or are they going to be complicit than the erosion of the foundations of that democracy that we currently have just thanks to them now other questions neighbors for thank you i noticed it started your presentation you mentioned the great game designer Sid Meier yes and I was wondering if you 'd tried civilization 5 and if there 's any comparison with rebuilding Canterbury I hadn 't considered it no it 's a similar genre well yes civilization is interesting because you 're effectively a totalitarian dictator yeah as a player the people the people the digital sorry eggsy Oh on a more serious fang coming to the question of limited government yep I absolutely wider taxpaying public of New Zealand putting in 16 and a half billion dollars of the country 's money and targeted on particularly around some of those anchor projects and critical infrastructure and the Canterbury rebuild isn 't it appropriate that the minister would representing the whole country have a very clear role in different very clear role and definitely the crowd has has a stake is definitely one of the stakeholders yeah in the rebuild process I think this goes beyond that because all that pretty much did any plan anything even if it 's not necessarily involving government they can just say so I you know I think definitely crown involvement is is incredibly important jay-z said is that there 's a huge you know general taxpayer involvement so you 're definitely that that makes the crown the government a significant stake holder but I 'd rather that that was a stakeholder not a bottle nicktim you Janey um thank you for a very original submission I 'm just interested in game theory and you said that they 've changed the rules that changes the way people play 've got a video digital games in general a veto power can you just elaborate on how it changes the way people play the game well it was more of a broad statement that any ruling change no matter their lead tiny rules they can make quite a significant impact on how players choose things I mean take soccer for example the simple fact of being able to hold the ball completely changes the game it 's 11 so yeah just that as I said the veto power the ability just say no that 's we 're not going to do that just the fact that that exhibits as a possibility is going to change you know any rational player of the game thinking through what are the odds of that actually happening and if the odds of that are happening actually nil hmm wife and have that there okay thank you okay Tim thanks very much we 've used time but thank you for a really good submission and a pretty cool t-shirt thank you _"

    "text": "organizations that stem off from there so that actually the public of Christchurch the people that it 's actually meant to before buy into that and actually feel like they 're part of it and then you know makes life easier for for these plans that need to be integrated implemented on it that appears to be it Dion thank you very much cooley appreciate your written submission appreciate your taking the time to be here with us today and for sharing your views with us thank you we now come to a submission from a little tempore company umber and Joe Appleyard to make the submission good afternoon captain I come you 've been sitting in the gallery sort of watching the pricey so I 'm sure you 're familiar with it we 've got about 15 minutes we 've got the very fulsome submission yes and hopefully you 're gonna take us through please um I drafted the submission and as you might appreciate it 's quite legally complex and it has been here so i wasn 't going to propose to deal with technical draft and questions get met do CT looks a little pricier okay well he can do it I 'm happy I 'm happy to answer the technical drafting questions but what I 'd like to do is introduce you to Peter Davey who 's the chief executive of little import company and he can tell you why we need what we 're seeking and I can deal with how I have tuned what we 're seeking into the technical aspects he 's terrified you 're going to ask him questions about the drafting so he 's just going to explain why we need a couple of clauses Peter oh there 's only a couple of others yes so Peter will tell you why we need it and then I can deal with some anything will technical yeah welcome Peter thank you so I 've got three areas i really want to cover the first one just to give a little bit of background to the little import recovery plan and why this came about so fundamentally as a result of the earthquakes we needed to do of rebuild work and we needed over it from Environment Canterbury Sarah etc and worked out that it was going to take over ten years to put in place so what we did then when when we were tasked with the recovery plan when he Cain was to ask for the recovery plan has looked at our long-term development looked at how we could develop the port both of what we had in for the future and talked about moving the port to the east significantly with a large reclamation and turning some of the older part of the port back to community use so it could be used for a number of different purposes the recovery plan was gazetted and put through but as yet and the bill doesn 't cover the recovery plan so we actually need it covered to take effect as we go forward so that 's the first point the second point is under the recovery plan a lot of the key developments controlled activities under the RMA and in order to make sure that they 're enforced and the way that the recovery plan was designed we need to make sure relevant authorities and so we want to make sure that it 's not inconsistent with the recovery plan as we go forward the third point is about reclamation so we started with a ten hectare reclamation we 're doing another 24 hectares this will be done over a period of time under the existing RMA section 116 it says that we 're not actually allowed to use that land until the reclamation is completed given that it can be a number of years that doesn 't make a lot of sense to us and in fact with existing reclamation once we had a piece of land we actually started using that for imported cargo for rebuilds and all sorts of different things so and we submit that it makes sense that actually we use the land as it becomes available as we reclaim it forward and that in tune and time means that we can then free up some of the inner harbor land for community use rather than waiting till the reclamation 's completed as a whole so that 's what I like to cover thank you so no quite technical I 'm the first one as probably did the change that I 've sit out at paragraph 12 of the submission which is the easy one which is just add another recovery plan and to the bill now that we have it the sections through 13 14 and 15 are really just some clarity around what would happen if the recovery plan was to be amended and we just want to be absolutely sure their LPC would be covered within that definition of responsible entity so that 's just a clarity issue the change that I seek we seek at 22 I think it 's just an oversight and it 's in the existing legislation at the moment that sees that decision makers on resource consents for certain types of resource consents aren 't to act and consistency whether a Kaveri plane but for some bizarre reason controlled activities aren 't only lists and I don 't know whether that was intentional it 's just an oversight it may well just be an impression that because of controlled activity needs to be granted has to be granted there that controlled activities can have onerous conditions placed on them that can undermine those consents as much as an outright decline of a discretionary or non-complying activity so in given that we 've managed to achieve so much under the recovery plan and that most of the key activities that we 're going to have to seek consent for will be controlled activities we want to make sure that the reclamation for example as an undermine body and position of conditions which does make it not viable isn 't the port company haven 't been able to use the emergency powers to get the fearful Hickey reclamation as a controlled activity now just seeking to get an even easier run and to limit the ability of the Regional Council ticular to put conditions on up to protect environmental and social well-being and in littleton township oh no we 're not seeking we 're not seeking that the conditions aren 't onerous we 're simply seeking that they are consistently with the recovery plan and any other type of consent the legislation sees that they have to be consistent with a activity could be inconsistent but others would have to be consistent but surely I mean this case law that the council can 't deny consent by imposition of conditioned on a controlled actively so isn 't that the protection no well I mean that there are a whole range of conditions that could be put on a consent that could undermine what the spleen and teens just a have a practical effect of of doing that such as oh well I like I mean there could be conditions put on the reclamation that just make it practically unusable but then then you could challenge the council because yeah you can 't_''_450.38 do that lead early and then at the moment the legislation omits LPC from being a party that can challenge so that 's the next step in this legislation certain parties can challenge a decision-maker were they acting consistently with a recovery plan and LPC is not included in that list so we end up with a situation where we go along and ask for our controlled activity and theory the ride should be easier we don 't have you contacting consistently and that since we might be better being non-complying or discretionary because at least we would have that additional protection and then if we think a decision maker as is acting and consistency the legislation excludes us from one of being one of the parties able to take that to the minister for a for a decision so that 's the so i think we 'll let Joe continue on a list or a pressing question yeah sure it 's been probably that the main the main changes that we are seeking are the ones in paragraph 46 and those are lifted more or less tamura the wording and the existing order in council for the 10 hit Korea reclamation and they are the ones that are short so you can start using the reclamation as soon as you get a consent for it so I have as much as I can try to mirror the wedding that 's used in the order in council I did think about in the submission whether we should just ask for the ability to grant another order in council to be more politically unacceptable than asking for some specific clauses and the legislation specifically to deal with this particular reclamation in effectively being able to override section 116 the RMA and allow it to commence earlier than when it 's finished so I have as much as possible stuck to the reading of the order in council because there was obviously a whole lot of work done on the drafting of there soon okay now our questions so David did you hear but yeah I understand your point in terms of listing controlled activity in subject to advice from officials that seemed sensible at the bottom of page for day you say that you want your your your relief that you seek isn 't just to add controlled activities 231 to a but you think that responsible your entity should be able to comment on in a in a in a preliminary way upon proposals that affect you I wonder wonder why why that why you see yourself different in a matter of principle to other people in the community whose interests might be affected by some other draft plan amendment to 30 13 or demon chuckles 2022 okay this is this is a relation to amendments to the recovery plan and we were the party who was jointly directed with a key and respect of this particular recovery plan so we were they joint party directed so if there 's going to be an amendment to it we would expect to see ourselves in the luster parties that would have a view on there yeah I understand at that point but how is that different from someone else who is affected by an amendment to another plan because I mean you would still have a right of submission and the later part and the process yeah we 've had other people coming to us saying that they think that broader members of the community who would be affected by new plans or changes to regeneration plans in the future that they should have a right of participation early in the process you are you effectively agreeing they should know this is just official to you it made me know that you 've pointed that out it could be rebooted were the party directed to prepare the plan so when I say a responsibility to whom a draft plan or amendment as relevant I 'm talking about a party who was originally the party directed to prepare it should also be the party so the originating yes it 's so in this but I 'm talking about the originating party when there is a subsequent I mean man i 'm not talking about people are just generally interested so so so so logically you 're saying because you think you should have status as someone who can start a plan yes you as you did in fact if you should have status like the council 's yes and I see now that you pointed that out there to whom the amendment as relevant might be a little bit too wide for what what I 'm getting at there I yep and then just the the point on these changes that you want better sit out on seven and eight I haven 't got my head around those probably but he but are you effectively trying to rewrite the plan that through a change in the plan under the bill now we can 't change the plan so we have changed all the regional plans to get control activity status yeah and that they 're not a problem section 116 toe of the RMA so its primary legislation sees we can 't use the reclamation until so we could not use the recovery plan process to change the primary registration because the ministers powers were limited to changing district plans and so it 's the RMA that 's the problem and so we didn 't have any subordinate Lee just she couldn 't change the primary legislation so that 's the RMA that 's the problem and I thank you nice so you 're effectively submitting that the air we should through this legislation change in the area made because I think that 's a silly rule yeah well just didn 't respected us reclamation was suggested to me by Sarah officials last week that I might want to change it for everybody that 's doing a reclamation and New Zealand but you thought we might need submissions on there yeah in New Zealand but this particular change would just be for this particular information yeah so it 's not it 's not a bit I was it was a problem because it was the one thing we couldn 't do through the port recovery process was changed the RMA when can I change are you going to be submitting on the area built as well we say for everyone good it 's always good good good Eugenie nn-not doesn 't feel recovery pain because you 're staging the reclamation does that 116 having to look at it why does it require that you can 't use it till it 's finished is it so that it all settles um I think I think it as because until it 's surveyed it doesn 't become leaned in the district so it doesn 't become part of the city the city 's jurisdiction until it 's become leaned and it doesn 't come lay into it 's finished and surveyed yeah so the RMA sees your builder and then your survey and then it becomes learn that the City Council in his cover it off then because if that 's the case we 're giving you jurisdiction to liquid to use it no one 's got jurisdiction to control your demand the main time it will still be within the Regional Council yeah so it becomes and it 's the situation with the team hit kumi promotion at the moment that it 's so you 're saying that the title wouldn 't be assured no I would yeah yeah and you couldn 't use it until title is it that 's the problem is that is that I think the intent of the legislation is the probably thinking about one here to keep deer exclamations you build them than you survey them and then you get a title and then it becomes land and the district but there doesn 't work with something for 24 hectares it 's going to take years and years to get so if we do this who has status over your the range the regional count that still would even though you even though it 's not lend ya and I and I have actually a transition and this legislation which is in the order in council to that LPC would progressively survey so you 're not going to wait for a decade in it so I just suggested sometime Thursday which it would be surveyed in people would become land not that you have a question because in most of its been answered actually because it was sort of running the expedia of use of this reclaim lean and also you know sitting presidents for reclaim Lambert that 's been answered but it was some yeah that just the observation is that he can Peter Scott was in here this morning as well which and he also requested that the littleton port recovery plan actually be included oh well I didn 't know he was going to do that well yeah but yeah then he specifically that they were that they were the other party obviously jointly directed so it was a joint direction to Environment Canterbury into little to import company it might be worth it some stage that submission will be available to you and you might like to might have a look at 's saying is exactly what you were saying yeah Eugenie told activities so if they if the bill remains an amended in relation to that wouldn 't it mean that the council can only impose conditions which meet the purpose of the RMA yes yeah so it is a broader scope to impose conditions then it would be as if it meant the poor company suggesting was made years we would have another rider saying but it can 't undermine the recovery plans so there might be a there might be conditioned it would go that could go on but for there but for me submitting use but that would frustrate the purpose of this particular recovery playing thank you okay I don 't think there 'll is there any other pressing matters thank you very much a really useful submission Peter Joe think thanks very much now Joe you 've up next for the next 10 maybe a couple of minutes on the yes sir I got ya thank you so this is the submission of burwood resource recovery part limited and I had hoped to have the chief a flight so he 's not here but that 's that 's fine this is a pretty simple submission we would recovery resource recovery Park has the role of processing earthquake waste and it 's currently largely authorized under an order in council which the bill proposes to revoke that order in council which we do think as appropriate and time and the meantime we 've been weary working very very hard to get the in particular the Christchurch study plan and shape so that when the order and council expires we have a planning regime in which we can apply for consents to continue the work of the park we notice that the regeneration bill extends the time for decisions to be made on the replacement plan and the submission has really driven out of a consume that we could end up with a whole we 're by the ordering council for beer what expires but we don 't yet have in place the chapter dealing with forward and the Christchurch plan now the hearing on chapter 21 on the Christchurch plan was on Wednesday this week and I and they were receptive to that but obviously this is chapter 21 they 've been sitting for a year and they 've got lots of people asking them for early decisions so this is about some races to cover the situation we are burwood has to make applications for resource consents in there are a lot of them we are going to need to make and we end up with a situation where the Burwood order in council expires in the replacement district plan panel has not delivered its decision on chapter 21 which will for the future control the activities that accurate view word so it 's really just a timing issue so we want the beer would order and counts all extended to line up with the replacement district plan decisions on chapter 21 effectively so we don 't end up with a hole in the middle yeah David we 're there any other comparable order councils that effectively granted the equivalent of resource consents that could be tied up with that same problem well they were the port one is once the 10 hectares but I decided already commenced and they don 't need any new ones I also act for Orion and I looked at the Auto encounter and asked them that question and they 've indicated they have all their consents in place I can only speak the ones I act for but I did make those inquiries dude just in terms of the scale of the number of sort of resource consent like permissions that were given by order of counsel do you know how many they were since the earthquake I well I know I don 't know you 'd have to ask you 'd have to ask here but most of these order uncounseled weird to facilitate controlled activity non-emotive fine resource consents so there will be a few of them so we need to check that I thank you doing it I think yeah what might be one difference says that as the time frame some of them were 14 free activities and their I ones for example they see we 've had the conceit we 've done the tempura activities we don 't need the consents anymore Walker whereas Verwoerd consents into the future is just the provisions and the plan is notified applied would that create too much uncertainty because you is that they they have gone through quite a bit of change and the mediation and process of leading up to leading up to the here own we actually had complete agreement with all the parties by the time we got to a hearing last week so but they have been through quite a bit of change and the provisions of the operative plan are not particularly friendly there _"

    "text": "very useful and helpful submissions thank you thank you for your obvious work that you put them on play thank you and today 's last submitted not least by any manner is Suzanne Steubenville serve I got that right for close to good on you 're welcome mine 's very woolly position minds are very woolly submission can Bob with Jones are 10 every submission has its weight exactly that 's a very good word mr. Parker thank thank you um the reason I submitted was because I had understood that there were several organizations that were trying to curtail the finish time of this act and I 'd like to support the act as it stands because i think the City Council has just gone through an enormous amount of change and still has to embed that change in their way of working in particular in their style of working their culture of working being collaborative and consulting with the public and I see in the act that this specifically requires that the group our consultative and collaborative and so the style of the act I think supports a currently getting out of Christchurch City Council which I 'm sure will change in future but my thought is that it will take them some time to reach that and therefore I fully support the 2021 end date and the other reasons that I gave almost mission is because we 've already seen that the minister does consult with all parties on an even basis he 's not he 's non-party oriented when he does his discussions as far as I understand from the various members of parliament that I 've spoken to you from multiple parties and the only one thing that I thought might be a little niggle is that the the Act describes land which is in the residential area and in the recently proposed revised district plan some of those residential area boundaries have changed I only know about Littleton I know they have there so that I think it would be useful just to be precise about which set of residential boundaries the Act refers to because they have changed between the times that the red zone was originally created and the current revised district question and I was puzzled by your comment that mr. Brownlee has consoled aboard the lift of representatives from all political parties certainly there is an invitation to comment all there was on orders and counsel but that 's the limit of their consultation with the green party anyway thank you don 't need to ask that are there any other kitchen _"

    "text": "squeezing some of your time for the previous submission it 's got to be thank you very much can i call now to the table please Ryan Reynolds from life and vacant spaces get fuller and greening the rubble it looks like we 've got an extra an extra paper that 's just being circulated yes I 've got 12 copies along yeah I 'll give this helpful enough for everyone a little addendum there our initial submission topped more in terms of broad principles and the addendum we 've just circulated adds a few more details of specific wording and clauses oh i can write so welcome you 've been watching the process we 've got a limited amount of time but hopefully enough for you to get your points across so welcome thank you and thanks for the opportunity and for holding some of the Select Committee hearings down in Christchurch we collectively having we very much do appreciate it so I 'm here representing gap filler today this is Wendy odd not representing greening the rubble and Jane Greg representing life in vacant spaces I don 't three different organizations that all started post-quake and we differ very much in terms of our emphasis and our methodologies and the particular way we go about things but in general we share a vision to involve people in meaningful ways in the recovery of the city and so collectively we 've been creating and facilitating mostly temporary public spaces and collaborative creative projects around the city and and initially generally speaking we set out to do this for the benefit of the community and the thing we discovered along the way was that actually involving people and local organizations was not only good for them it 's actually been good for us and be good for the project 's the public artworks the gardens the buildings and the amenities that we 've jointly created because involving people in that process involving them in the creation of their communities means that they have a greater stake in its present and its future so they use the spaces more they keep them active they maintain them they 's trial new startup businesses and so on and so in short we found project helps create spaces were positive social economic environmental and cultural outcomes overlap which to us might just be a definition of regeneration and so we made in our initial submission I guess two and a half main points and just to be confusing i 'll start with point 2m post-disaster pretty much all of the experts who have been coming to christchurch and they 've been a lot of them are talking of the importance of a holistic approach and and that to me refers to the sort of the four well-beings the social economic environmental and cultural and all three of our organizations overwhelmingly have had a really positive experience with christchurch city council who we feel truly act as custodians of the for well beings and of the communities in terms of the local government act um so we would like to see some of the minister 's powers limited we are as you said we liked the idea of regenerate christchurch being truly a collaboration and so now if you look at point one on the addendum around clause 42 sub-clause three which would give the document or a plan made under the LGA and a few other key X and it was sub-clause three in particular that that I think we 'd like to see removed the other sub-clauses refer to some other acts that we 're less familiar with but in general we 'd like to see that those clothes 42 powers re-evaluated in light of the principles throughout this submission and we also don 't really understand the need to retain some of the provisions such as in clauses 48 and 57 that would give the minister the right to engage in work on private land without the consent of property owners or to direct private landowners in certain regards as we understand it those provisions in the sera act were primarily regarding demolitions and and the possible need for urgent demolitions of structures and now of course we 're faced not so much with demolitions but with derelict sites and our organizations have actually done extensive research on policies around the world to do with derelict sites and buildings and in general the worldwide trend is for local governments to maintain something to have a system of either incentives and disincentives either right to rebate if you make your site look nicer or for in some places right penalties you know if your site 's vacant for a few years then your rates actually double something like that but in general the worldwide trend overwhelmingly is for those sorts of registers to be dealt with by the local government rather than a central or state authority and point to be of our initial submission had to do with crown Co now I understand this particular legislation we 're discussing isn 't setting out the parameters of what crown Co is and does and doesn 't do and in fact we don 't know too much about crown Co but but in our view if crown Co ends up being a much larger and having a much larger budget than regenerate Christchurch then de facto the central government sort of power and influence over Christchurch will be much more than what the aspirations of the regenerate Christchurch legislation and so the only part in terms of the actual legislation it was in clause one of our generate Christchurch 's functions is and the wording is to provide advice to crown CO and development Christchurch and to comment on the contribution of which to us sounds quite weak if we 're actually wanting to set up the idea of a collaboration that we generate Christchurch 's is a sort of collaborative body truly overseeing things and we don 't make any specific suggestions for what the wording might be and but we 'd like to see those particular clauses be a bit stronger in terms of the hierarchy and that the collaborative entity that is regenerate Christchurch and would have a bit more clout than either the entire council own development Christchurch or an entire crown-owned konechno and then our last point which we consider to be our main point and that refers to point one in our original and original submission and I 'll refer to share an idea so the first major and central Christchurch recovery plan of course was developed on the back of share an idea which was a widely heralded community consultation campaign but overwhelmingly the people of Christchurch and that there have been virtually no opportunities to re-engage in the subsequent four and a half years it feels a bit like a one-off exercise I think we all feel that way ourselves but regardless of the truth of that assertion the fact that that 's the general perception is bad for the regeneration of the city the fact that people feel disempowered feel that they won 't listen to and it is unequivocally a negative and so looking at the purposes of the Act particularly its claws three see that they 're currently states one of the purposes of regenerate Chrysler to be enabling community participation in the planning of the regeneration of Greater Christchurch we suggest just a few amendments here one is to add the word on going and so the idea that that the consultation is not a one-off exercise but that there are opportunities for follow-up on that also we 'd like to add the words beside community and local not for profit or third sector participation so we find a lot of the timing our own organizations we don 't feel that they of organizational resource and we have some paid staff and so we 're in a better position to for instance make a submission on this sort of legislation and devote the time to that then your average resident and the last thing is at the end of that clause so when it talks of the community participation in the planning of the regeneration of Greater Christchurch we 'd like to add and throughout the implementation and execution of those plans as well I probably don 't want to get down into the detail as previous submissions talking about Tamaki and what form of consultation that might be I think if he 's set it up front and the purposes that that 's the aspiration in general and then leave it to the regenerate Christ Church Committee to figure out the best way and to implement that but just as we were sitting there I 'll just close now when the sort of whispered to me during one of the previous submissions you said you know she feels a lot more connected to the community and to the city of christchurch through her profession we 'll work as a professional landscape architect and that 's a shame but but that 's the case for most people and so I guess the aspiration behind these amendments that were recommending is just to to create more avenues for people to create and find that connection to the city Thanks thank you David Parker 's got a question yes you suggest in your submission that some of the provisions and claws 42 of the bill ought to be reconsidered I 'm I 'm not sure I 'd properly understand that point because it seems to me that if you are going to have regeneration plans that effectively have power to overwrite some of the rules that would otherwise apply and it 's actually why you 're having these plans the minister needs to be able to give effect to that by varying the provisions in existing plans that run contrary to the rules that have been proposed in a regeneration plan ok but then perhaps it 's the nature of how those powers are enacted because I would rather see the powers through the generate crisis art and if the powers actually need for statutory regions to be held by the minister than then i would like to see some relationship where the board of a generate christchurch could make that request or maybe maybe that the request needs to originate from the board of a generate christchurch and then the minister is the one to a now so you can you acknowledge that if you 're going to have regenerate plans that you someone needs to have that plan but you think it should be more prescribed as arising from the regenerate well from the regeneration plans I think so radio thank you listen we have found almost uniformly we have almost uniformly found central government institutions to be unresponsive unsupportive unable to navigate their own bureaucracies to deliver good community outcomes and generally an informed about the minion diversity communities in Christchurch do you think that site do you think that is because of the institution 's themselves the power they have had under the syrah legislation all the fact that they are based often and wellington what is it and is from my perspective I think the choice to run run the recovery of the city as a government ministry politicized the whole exercise and so I mean I can give an instance where life and vacant spaces was approached by staff members within Syria and ccd you and to propose some temporary interim use activities on the East frame one of the one of the anchor projects and they stipulated a few requirements that it couldn 't just be the normal sort of stuff that we do but needed to be a little more polished a little bigger scale we went off and worked with a lot of our partners developed a proposal and it went through a process where it got approved by was 18 or 19 different staff members within Sara by the operations team and the legal team whatever whatever and it landed on the desk of Warwick Isaacs and he didn 't saw you know he didn 't make the 19th or 20th signature whatever it was and that whole process took nine months and this is when you 're trying to do quick response temporary and and I I think it was because every decision has political consequence and political risk when it 's a government ministry and so the yeah the organization seemed to lack an ability to delegate power down the down the chain I guess one of the tensions for the committee don 't dealing with a bill is how to provide that flexibility and not prescribe processes too much hmm it 's a pattern that 's it yeah sorry that wasn 't here no looking out laughs yeah that 's my girl oh okay sure the stuff

    "text": "students in that case can I thank three of you for taking time to spend with us this afternoon we 'd certainly appreciate with appreciate your thoughtful considered opinions and thank you for sharing them with us thanks thank you thanks very much and I call now to the table please Raviv karasyk was that close welcome we 've been sitting a little sort of watching watching proceedings yeah we 've got about ten minutes yet we 've got you 're feeling brave written submission so we 're looking forward now to hearing what you might have to add today it will be probably as short good evening my thank you for your time um actually I thought about doing one thing but then I spoke to RINO then I 'm going to do something else I 'm actually want you to keep all the powers within government because it 's better for us and a good example is what happened in Kazakhstan where the government decided that they 're going to move the capital from where it is next to the Chinese border next to the Russian one they wide boulevards wonderful Convention Center new Parliament new buildings just stunning place to live in and then it all all the public servant to move to that place but although this city is also paid with gold there isn 't sense of communities there anymore and people are not really engaged and not really feeling at home I myself come from Israel i grew up in israel israel was claimed by government down I grew up in an area that was planned with cities and small villages and all of that sand and it 's all worked very well done on the paper by government when it came to reality it didn 't work so I was lucky to be at Lincoln University five years ago when Susan balance organized a symposium to look about recovery after natural disasters all around the world most of it was done through skype and the theme came out of that and what comes is that after natural disaster central government jumped in and go I 'll save the day and it 's good because everybody in panicking we need someone from the outside last hour during this process people don 't feel engaged they don 't feel the power and although the decisions are probably made to the right extent and i write it in place because the local community don 't feel engaged with that they don 't feel the power and when people don 't feel power they 're coming to unrest which actually benefited me I work for correction people who don 't feel part of community go into a fence I get work crisis was slightly differ because we had shared the idea but as we mentioned after share the idea no consultation came about and all around the world it showed us the decision that central government made are actually the right decision but only after local community start to be involved and get the right to say Singh they accept that development and they feel engage and they 're happy with it so those wonderful maps of the red zone and CBD and everything our plant that actually makes sense but because none of us has essay on it we look on them like we don 't get the local people to be engaging the rebuild to feel part and to feel bad of this wonderful city and want to live here and it 's up to you to give that power back to the people of Christchurch and as people said the blueprint you built was probably based on on sharing idea and once we have the right to say in it we probably tweak it a bit but as a whole it 's going to be the same the Elven river that 's the map to your right all of that great area are probably to work the risk correction planting trees and doing native gardens and doing farming gardens but again if then and that 's probably what 's going to happen but if you let the local people say that they 'll have ownership and they 'll be more likely to be happy with the result that 's my submission thank you thank you very much now are there questions paul foster bell it 's a very interesting parallel you draw sir i am some of my colleagues will confirm this noted on we 're housing where the houses have gone and there are still fruit trees and trees left actually were reminiscent I thought of some of the kyboot semuc and Israel and you could see the potential that that might be where things he went Cyrus Sarah started we actually throw correction used to go and collect fruit from there and give it to the city mission that was one of the job I did _"

    "text": "been talking them back today so I just didn 't go i 'm just came straight here well that 's very good I can 't open still here yeah it 's raining of course miserable weather up there any should have gone to the coromandel know that submission ended hahaha you wanna take me outside yeah connection guy okay we 've got about 15 minutes we 've got you we 've got your written submission Dion come and looking forward to you taking us through there alright so thank you guys very much everybody for coming down to Christchurch to listen to this everybody who 's been speaking today I think where I 'm representing rebuild Christchurch and myself giving the submission rebuild Christchurch is an organization that was founded on 6th of September 2010 for the people who don 't know well before the ebrary earthquakes happened we really represent the voice for people of Christchurch to get communication out to them so people understand what was going on we 've got two organizations under our umbrella so we 've got a charity foundation which is rebuild Christchurch foundation cash into the communities of Christchurch over the last four years we haven 't done much over the last two years because we 've wound down and we 're looking at education more than anything else in the rebuild Christchurch Limited which is on the director of my colleague who 's the Secretary of the foundation couldn 't come because he 's sick but our engagement we get around 500,000 people a month from local and international sort of coming to us or through our channels that we communicate to looking at what 's going on with the recovery of Christchurch and through that over the last five years more than five years now I 've gathered a lot of information about sort of the feel of how people feel about Christchurch what 's been happening and all that sort of stuff and that was really the basis of the submission that we had we went out and spoke to people through our different mechanisms and things like that and actually wanted to get a feel for the move so there 's a lot of technical stuff into in the really wanted to talk about today was actually about the culture of what the submission process now sorry the the act or the bill might arm might create so firstly there are some good things happening in Christchurch with the recovery there 's been some really amazing stuff happen and you know from a disaster where we actually were to where we are now there is actually some good stuff so that does need to be acknowledged but regeneration what is regeneration and how 's it going to look into the next a little bit of the future and one of the things that I really wanted to nail down here is the regeneration can 't_``_157.29 happen for a lot of our communities yet and that isn 't acknowledged in the Billy at all or into the culture of maybe what the bill might come so as a chair as a trustee on the Canterbury insurance assistance service we 're actually trying to help people with their insurance claims a lot of people haven 't passed go yet and so we 're talking about regeneration of areas in Christchurch where can get engaged in this process because they haven 't even passed go there still thinking about insurance they 're still thinking about the leaky house because it 's earthquake damaged and I really would like to see inside the bill some actually acknowledgement of that and actually maybe some processes that can come out of regenerate Christchurch that actually also acknowledge that as a big issue that 's for people people have lost hope in these two Christchurch and so we do have a city of two halves here we have the city of of West Christchurch and then East Christchurch and if we 're talking about regeneration most of the regeneration bill is actually focus on central city and then out east and those are the people that we need to be engaging with we need to be talking to because if we don 't have the collaboration of a bill we 're not going to have participation and that 's not going to have trust and if the trust isn 't there then these things that we 're going to do these these plans all these regeneration communities and communities that are going to move forward so a council in crown partnership one of the things I wanted to question about that was why is the council not part of the submission process in terms of of sitting at the committee level and that 's a legislative issue that may be that needs to be looked at but if we 're going to look at this as a model moving forward that might be something that needs to be looked at I 'm a member of the paddy haka trust what it might be soon because that 's where I lived for a long time that 's where my family 's from and we 're doing something very soon to a regeneration for patty hawker at the moment and that is a conversation we 've been having there so they want representation on some of these things when we go to sort out the crown settlement and stuff like that one of the things about the regeneration build that I 've noticed is there 's a lot of reference to the minister and if this is going in terms of regeneration I think we need to maybe rephrase that to something that 's more appropriate to their actual partnership don 't know what those words are yet and that 's so that 's a process that maybe we can come down to but I think there needs to be a better representation to what the minister do actually means and actually why is that still in there where it 's just basically taken out from the old bill which is a Serie act and moved into the one of the one of the things that I have seen over the last five years is actually a change in the political landscape politicians are actually now starting to understand this partnership is collaboration but there 's middle management of these organizations aren 't and that 's where I wanted to really focus down on ref regenerate Christchurch we don 't get that collaboration that collaborative mindset we 're just going to have a whole lot of people in the organizations that are coming out of here if we don 't have a strong leadership of what regenerate Christchurch all these people that aren 't going to let regeneration happen and that 's because they 're looking after their jobs they 're looking after their incomes and things like that it really needs to be a really clear leadership within this organization and that 's really where I come down to my submission if we go down to our page page nine d pmc and the Canterbury unit now this is one of the things that really bugs me and I still haven 't got any information out of many people about what it actually means but if the Canterbury unit within DPM see is going to have 50 staff we generate Christchurch maybe about 30 and then other things that are going to happen where does that collaboration actually fit does that actually mean that the council in the crown in terms of regenerate Christchurch and middle management collaboration and where is those resources going to happen and if the intent of actually there needs to be some really clear parameters around that so what I wrote there as we recommend that the bill have included clear purposes how they will interact ensuring that ken debris unit is not in a position to influence the decision-making powers and the lead role of regenerate Christchurch that is one of the biggest things a lot of people we 've been consulting with are actually coming back to us and gun well who is the leadership who 's going to be leading this next phase of Christchurch is recovery on that same page we talked about crown Co again that 's that their exceptional delineation between who 's actually leading and who 's actually doing so we want to reinforce it crown case should just be basically giving you know those anchor projects done a couple of other other notes there we know that there 's no actual mention of the earthquake itself in the actual bill and no mention of the natural environment or the well-being of people so we would like to see that included community input into regeneration plans so at the moment the regeneration plans can be as the bill states can be nominated or whatever by night ah who the council or regenerate cross usual the in there we actually communities can actually look at participating into that and actually saying you know there 's a like we had the sudden people here before we believe that there should be a process that 's actually in place where people can say okay we want those regeneration plan or act enforced it actually makes something happen of that and there 's a whole lot of notes in there one of the other if you go to page six interpretation clause for ministerial powers under the Act should no longer wrist with a single minister so reinforcing what I was just saying before it should also include the say the minister of local government or at least aamir somehow not exactly sure how that will work legally there 's a whole lot of other points there but they aren 't important for that because you can read them our access to crown land okay so this is one of the other things that 's really really important for for what we 've done I just hosted a television that was looking at the recovery of his Christ Church about East Christchurch and the recovery there but whenever you talk to them about their ideas they go well it 's never going to happen anyway because the government 's not going to let it happen but we we 've got an opportunity now to actually enable small projects to happen through regenerate Christchurch potentially or through Lin 's or whoever is going to do this to actually put small wins on the board and actually start to engage our communities back into that so small little project allowing access to that land of the first instance will go a long way making it safe i think has been done by sarah and it 's going to be done by linds and don 't withhold the excess and that 's part that 's on page seven and on page eight we sort of talked about the biggest opportunity for christchurch the implementation on the integrated vision for the avon river and autocad lands as a whole so that the greater christchurch communities can actually get involved in there and i think that 's really a big crux of regenerate christchurch pretty much what I had to say here there was one point I really just want to go back to strengthen the RC mandate will the regenerate Christ you tremendous so that actually regenerate Christchurch is the leader or is the lead role here in proper collaboration with the council and the crown that that real sticky point there with the crown will sorry d pmc is going to derail potentially that lead role and if we want to make a good effort of this and actually want to make sure that christchurch regenerates it actually has really good you know a good recovery over the next five years we don 't need that to happen thank you that 's all down thanks very much members are there are questions Eugene council should be a member of this committee which yeah terms of pounds processes doesn 't necessarily work but would I step towards that be the council providing advice to the Select Committee on the legislation having the same as a serum I think something needs to be done i think if in the true sense of this collaboration be a partner in this new regenerate christchurch having to do a submission the same way that us from the community are doing that night i think that 's a good look for goodwill so I know there 's legal you know league wishes that probably need to be taken into consideration there but maybe this is actually a chance to change the model change the parliamentary model and actually sort of look at actually what is true collaboration because this could work she work for forty week for other parts of the country our four foot you know tamaki Makoto and you know talking to the Auckland Airport today about there are there plans you know they need to go through a similar process so there 's amazing opportunities right throughout New Zealand for actually meaningful collaboration thanks do you think that it 's working for you now yeah under the Treaty of Waitangi yep hilarious but even when you look at the partnership like earlier this morning the council actually submitted whether they should have an ottoman and while you 're there because but NATO who were also that because there are one of the three which actually lived out in early mentioned to and how that true partnership at manaphy Noah level and then at the Eyrie to do naina level which were also brings in the treaty yeah this differently I think some work they actually I think there 's some good opportunities here to actually do some really clever stuff with legislation okay I met the media chief exec command for the submission and just reading it back because I think we 're forgetting the work that happened to the steak so you know the idea of being not sitting around here they haven 't been able to input so just wondering if you our staff have been working closely with Sarah on regenerate Christchurch and we are alive that 's a pretty clear statements now as it is it a clear statement or is that a political statement that 's what you 've got to ask yourself I think I think there 's you know from from a feeling that I get there 's there 's a lot of political statements being been used creates ongoing so for full say regenerate Christchurch why is the crown not making a submission to to this process potentially if it 's going to be their partnership that 's kind of where I 'm kind of getting out with that and it 's and really what I would like to see is that real true collaboration if it 's going to happen that way actually creating and setting the precedent of a culture that actually on goes well that actually moves forward with regenerate christchurch and all the other organizations that stem off from that so that actually the public of christchurch the people that it 's actually meant to before buy into that and actually feel like they 're part of it and then you know makes life easier for for these plans that need to be integrated implemented on it that appears to be it Dion thank you very much CLE appreciate your written submission appreciate your taking _"

    "text": "I ask you to step aside and because we 're going to move on to the item 34 proposed venga Frost and avenue and deal with that now good i 'm by staff to come to the table just learning here oh yes now could those that are not participating in this decision and that 's the people who are on the art center trust board who are on the museum trust board if you could sit back from the table to make it clear that you 're not participating and that 's at all so in fact can go and get a cup of coffee if you want to as well so there 's no need to be involved and so I will move the the hearings panel recommendation driver second term scandrett are there any questions that so sorry yes of course you can it 's not just a just a few quick points and the hearings panel was made up our counselors in each in WV deputy me a piggyback and myself as the chair just on page 290 attach the main hearings panel report on poster background information well property legal and financial advice and options that council needs to consider when deciding with a de sorte that hearings of panel recommendations or not so the the heading on page 290 should really state that it 's a staff report and support of the hearings panel recommendation and on page 288 just as I 'm sure you 've all gone through this we received 144 submissions 128 of 415 against and one was undecided and at the hearings we did nine of those on page 29 97 one of the issues which was brought up in as was considered was loss of car parking near as an encounter council of between 100 and 150 thousand dollars per year the car parking is made up to a total of eighty car parks that 54 of those are leased so technically including the two mobility parks there are only 25 available for short term parking for the public and one motorbike however the hearings panel considered all of the motion presented and found in favor of option one which is on page three hundred and realistically there are that you will support the hearings panels finding and vote for option one and I don 't have my Phillip element with Jimmy would like something but thank you I think the staff for work with you thank thank you yes because as a human panocha the ticker mention or actually do as a heaven pendant which reveal all other kind of consultation summation and also we heard older the Oros emission sh world because of a spaceship this moment you know in we consider costs and effective whether it is benefit to the lister ctsh we thought if we lost the sample a kind of Licata residual but the with the hang of ponies you know where the secure these that the car park but we considered a moment that is kind of offer is aligned with the kind of the kingdom using the objective attractive molar visited earth to i chose especially after earthquake we thought as a huge benefit to the the city but lost the summer capital can mitigate a loss the reverse effect so overall we have least the recommendations another hmmm hmmm I just I just wanted to comment i did notice that one of the submissions indicated that i had a conflict of interest because my mears husband heeds trust question that which I was actually appalled to read my husband 's got nothing to do with the trust never hairs and I don 't know why the submitter made that comment but I wanted to place on record that my husband has nothing to do with it and I do not have a conflict of interest in this matter at all so I was just annoyed when I read that you 're not so so I 'll open it up for debate then Andrew thank you I 'm just very very quickly this is a tremendous gift for the city I think it 'll be an ongoing asset for the city I welcome the recommendations of the hearings panel and support motionless in front of us today I really welcome this proceeding and going here Adam thank you said that you could look at it on the short term with regards to there is a cash loss of around 100 hundred twenty land to the museum however the greater gift to the city is huge and I think to this cultural precinct will only add to this and when you find that the the spine will be the bravest car art but the regatta but around it will be the constant changing of the items that are seldom seen and not seen enough with regards to held and the the deep and dark dungeons of the museum so hopefully many many pieces will get to see the light by many people and debt will keep life and that builder so I 'm fully supportive thank you yes what Jamie yeah i just think this is one of these fabulous times that counts or when we sit around here we get to be part of a decision like this when i actually think that this is one of these these facilities will give us the city that we look back knee is tim quite correctly said i think it 's something that we can all be very proud of I think it 's like the city will love nature of decision making it act and it 's disappointing there 'll be a loss of car parking but the the generosity of the raven star trust and the Wakefield 's I think far outweighs on a monumental scale the the benefits versus versus the cons so we 'll find car parking all square we 'll deal with it I understand that it 's a it 's a serious problem in the secret city of christchurch at the moment that notwithstanding though we actually need to have a city that works we need to have a city that attracts people and actually have a city that 's fun and otherwise you know there 's not really any point in parking there to visit anything so I 'd just really like to commend one the hearings panel for the work that 's been done on this and most certainly the Wakefield 's as well for the generosity this is an incredible gift for the city and I think ensures that the heart of the city it 's going to be built on to be strong going forward in the future so I 'm really excited about to christchurch and the culture and in the front of the city that we want to be a part of long term thank you and I again I mean I agree with Jamie this is it 's actually wonderful to be part of a decision like this did you just one more so just the world with the museum that they are going to try and replace as many campaigns feasible so it 's not a loss of 80 car parts hopefully develop a lot me so I should have mentioned it before yes you know I mean I was going to mention that as well that there is an intention to have short-term parking as part of the whole proposal underneath so a lot of underground and then at the retention of the of those are facts that are along the side so there is a considerable amount of work being done on ensuring that there is car parking short-term car parking available for people who are visiting that area and obviously visiting the facility but i guess that i wanted to particularly focus on on the generosity that at me because i keep forgetting the phrase but with the whole is greater than the sum of its parts so it may be a gift of land to the canterbury museum but we are basically shareholders and the canterbury museum through through through the legislation and and its role that provides to canterbury as a region that means that this what what is built there becomes part of a gift to the canterbury region and i think that makes it more than just something that 's for christchurch it 's actually for the region and i really want to pick up on work term seed which was that you know that it will be an opportunity for these wonderful treasures that we never see because they are and storage but we 're going to see them in a context and the context will be this art house museum it 's just extraordinary the feedback that I 've had you know around the coffee cups of books cafe and various other cafes where I usually start my day has been this is an overwhelming act of generosity and I know about it in the newspaper and talking about it I said put on a submission and people don 't and you could tell from this overwhelming weight of submissions that there is a real sense of excitement but also an incredible sense of gratitude to the weight fields and I know that their present and I want to acknowledge theme on behalf of the city but also on behalf of the region so on that note i will put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried unanimously thank you very much _"

    "text": "thank you all right good thank you so much just a lot and thank you for coming forward early that brings us to the submission of the sand albans residents association and we 've got Emma and any me you 've got been following a submission in your own name so what I 'm proposing to do is that essentially as long as it 's convenient with you is that we start off with the residents association one and in lead into yours and then hopefully we can just sort of take we sort of merge them a bit together is it all right cool welcome so we 've got a reasonable amount of time because that 's the the joy of sort of having submissions yes we 've got until about four o 'clock great so welcome to the committee over to you thank you thank you everyone thank you for taking your time to listen to our submissions I am here as a community leader my name is Emma to Adele and I 've been involved in community for st. Albans community for about 15 years I 've and though I am completely unprepared in have nothing actually really written down I know there 'll be a lot of submissions and hear about community lead development and that I hope that some of the things that I say will backup the data and the information that you 're provided for those that have had the time from those that have had the time to prepare it for you so and I hope I don 't bore you but anyway today I did wonder whether I should come so unprepared but am I think my experience does what does provide a lot of input and to what direction the Christchurch needs to take in the future and also my stars said to me today that there 's a Sagittarian new moon it charges up my communications own so it 's time to share stimulating conversation gossip good times drama and dreams starting with the gossip the driver of dreams well it cept up to you actually because I know that you 'll be presented a lot of information on community lead development and I think that maybe I mean government to really understand what it 's like to be down at the ground level and so I thought perhaps maybe you might have questions that I can help you have some insight into what it is like what it really means when we say we want that community leave development so you might take up some of my time yeah but I have been involved in sin on the cinnamons residents association for 15 years I 've set on the Sierra community forum for the last four years and given up two hours of my time every fortnight to come along and listen to what 's happening in their recovery and I have also spent a huge amount of time going and talking to disk listening and talking with Discoverer discovery recovery experts and so forth and so I hold a lot of information about what 's been going on in Christchurch and I think that that 's important that it comes across and these I get the chance to include this and the submission process today and I 've lost the little notes that I did like I just here to strengthen those other submissions that you 've heard on community leader development and I suppose I 'm first and foremost here today because I 'm a human I represent humans and as a human the environment that I live in is really really important I read a lot of books like this one here called happy city and about how urban design and what happens in a city is really important to the people of the city so yeah that 's first reason I 'm here is I 'm human i 'm also here as a woman and so the research that i have learnt as a very important voice to hear in the next stage of our recovery from the research that I have done it 's woman 's voice is really important and they regenerate a period where the nurturers and we provide those things that are important for the people living in the in the city i 'm also here as a mother my children have disappeared they meant to be here supporting me but they 're out playing outside I was going to what I ramble on about that at least my son will be very proud that I 'm sitting here having my say today but yeah as a mother the future of the city is really important to me and I really want to be involved in providing a spectacular environment for the future residents of Christchurch I 'm also still sitting here today as a teacher my experience and teaching shows taught me I used to be an environmental educator and there that taught me that you can change people 's attitudes really quite quite easily but changing their behaviors takes a disaster I think that we 've seen that in Christchurch that people of Christchurch have done this change they 've taken the leap already and that I 'd really love it to see the government support the people of Christchurch to in and be brave and turn the systems on their ear and put the people first and the grassroots development first and the legislation that they provide us there 's a lot of examples of this happening around the world Scotland being one of them Scotland 's of changing the way they do things through social enterprise there 's a lot of movement and Christchurch for social enterprise and it needs support from the government to really make it work and it would be a really exciting way to take christchurch i 'm also here as a business owner I lost my company in the earthquake so I 've had that experience too we had my husband and I had a company called decadence that we 've spent 15 years building up a niche market of cantilevered dicks over the side of hills oh yeah that slipped away on the rebreather 22nd so yeah I sit here with the experience behind me of him to rebuild a business in Christchurch so I have some understand i understand that business is important as well as people and now rebuilt and in that the businesses in Christchurch needs some continuing support from the government and their council as well i 'm also the building and the business that I 'm involved in as building construction and again this is an area in Christchurch that is high the only word was thinking about it was whoa it 's a pretty full-on industry and there 's a lot of issues in the time at this present time and the people involved in that industry needs support too I 'm here as a friend I 'm very social I like to talk to people I 've spent the last four years asking people about their personal situations and I know the people in Christchurch need support I know they need to have a government that puts them first and this in this bill yeah so I 've played many roles here in Christchurch post-earthquake most of them volunteers at volunteer role and so I 'm sitting here you know I 've got the experience that tells me that government needs to through the wording of the bill put people first and put the local leadership first through my involvement in the st. Albans residents so see over the last five years we lost our community center we lost our staff and we at the time had lost the backing of the City Council we have developed with with grow on a community out st. Albans the st. Albans news which I 've got here which shows this comes out every two months and it shows all the community development that 's happening in the grass level area of Christchurch and what we 've done and we 've done at all I 'm 50,000 so if the government wants to spend their money wisely you 're ensuring that they are supporting community lead development as a good way of doing that you know we 've put together a saint albans community strategy which has 20 local projects that will be led by volunteers in the area and they and so far we 've had four of those picked up by project managers volunteer who have volunteered their time to get these projects going in the area and this shows me that the support of the Christchurch people and making sure that we rebuild our city properly as huge and again needs the government and the local council to support what 's happening in those grass grass roots organizations I think I and my submission said that it would be great to have the in the writing of the bill I think they are particularly important and the people in what happens in those areas are particularly important to the to the future of Christchurch because that 's where our history lies st. Albans addington woolston said gnam and all the inner-city residents communities that they want though they 've got 150 odd years of history and in Christchurch they were the people that gave that they they come from the people who gave their land to build the roads these areas have the history that built Christchurch in the first place and it would be great to see that those history is recognized in the future and I think that 's really important that if those we don 't want a CBD that has nothing around it we want a CBD that has amazing residential communities that support what 's happening in the city so I 'd really like to encourage you to have a focus on those communities as well as the CBD the red zone and you brighten yeah I might just leave it there actually because I 'm a public do wonder if you 've got I mean I 've got the experience of being on that ground level and doing what we 're all talking about what we want to see happen in Christchurch so if you 've got any questions for me that may help your understanding of what we 're asking for please ask Todd and then you journey Thank you Thank You mr. chair on the basis of that George two children where Canterbury rugby jerseys they are sitting at the back and I 'll do not press naka that 's good can you is there any from your perspective a sort of a unified Lee uniform vision around what regeneration looks like looking at five years for the community of st. Albans no I don 't because I mean I 've got all my own opinions yeah yep but I think what is working and what is is people feeling empowered people feeling that they are actually important in part of this process I think over the last five years with dealing with EQC with all the changes a lot of people are feeling you what 's happening here in Christchurch and wants to Val hang in that by supporting them in a grassroot level will be rebuilding that involvement that they have I understanding because I 'm not from here are their limited occasions where the community of st. Albans get together and sort of have you know City Council facilitated conversations around what what the next few years could look like for that part of the city we have had none as so far okay yeah thank you I think I mean I 'm not putting any any institution down or anything because of that I think Christchurch has had some severe issues to be dealing with but our communities issues are still there and some of them hadn 't come to the forefront yet okay Thank You Jenny thank you and thank you for all the experience you 're bringing to us emotion today you 've said you want to concentrate all the concentrate on reducing layers of bureaucracy for communities to lead their own regeneration and you 've also talked about social enterprise can you just letting defy some of the probably the starter and having the resources and when I talk about resources not just money it 's having the support of the skills as a volunteer I have my whole life as well going on in the background and you know the administration of all that sort of thing it 's really hard to get funding to administrate projects and that 's where they fall over because people volunteers want to go and do things they want to get out there and and you know actually make see something happen they don 't want to search and go through all the you know the administrative side of seeing that happen yes so that 's a big barrier and support and leadership from the government would without providing some of the smaller ground funding to alert you yeah yes making it easy for people to make an hevin mad thank you so wasn 't quite before the regeneration bill or against it no I 'm sorry yes I am all right I am for it yeah I 've seen great in my time with on the with dealing with the 've actually seen some changes that I find really exciting within the government and local government and you know I just know that the people all they need is the people behind them to really make some change yeah yeah because I I mean of course being the mp4 why my career Ian you from saint albans i suppose is a bit of history there around the cranford street extension yes and i would argue that 's probably why we need something like regenerate to think through those issues strategically across the Greater Christchurch region absolutely of course quite rightly st. Albans is thinking locally about the Northern Corridor extension but equally communities of my electorate don 't want to be driving for an hour and a half and what should be a 20-minute drive yep no yeah I agree and I think you know dare I say it there 's been 40 years of bad transport planning happening over the last 40 years and again Christchurch has the chance to just you know really look at it all and do it properly yeah um yeah thank you I 'm also I know a number of people on those community forums that put so much of their time two hours as you say a week shouldn 't you should run for council oh it 's right I actually mean that 's probably why I 'm sitting here days because I 'm a volunteer and I can take the risk of sitting here and looking like a full today because I 'm not represent I mean I 'm not I have no ties to anything and because one of the most it 's one of the most exciting thing is about being a moment like a sorry I thought you actually critiqued it very very well you know again another really good overview from the coalface you know as you actually mentioned before so I mean within the sort of San Orban 's area you know looking at sort of house sales and new people coming in has it been a sort of a kind of a rejuve internal burns residents associations and all that sort of thing absolutely um there 's 70 volunteers involved in the organizer yeah okay um was unfortunately I couldn 't attend but they were piling out the doors okay yeah so so there is a real desire absolutely instant Albans and I mean it was the reston Albans plan we just had the Signum people in here before you know with their plan saying that it you know they 'd done their plan but it doesn 't have any teeth so that 's probably what you 're talking about is yeah yeah it is I mean yeah this is our plan so this is our community strategy here and it 's you know we want to public swimming pool we want this and it came from it we surveyed 7,000 we 've seen 7,000 surveys out got over a thousand and replies to you know things like safer roads and footpaths edgware village beautification getting the trim linked up to each week village developing a sense of place better housing community arts a fitness trek around melbourne park so these are the these are the things that the people of st. Albans have told us that they want in their community okay great so just around the the bill rationale the polity policy rationale it 's actually about enabling local leadership so I mean I think no one to get your euro and support us and thank you for your submission thought it to you thank you and that seems like a good place to finish Emma can I just thank you on behalf of the committee really good submission and as I said that was mighty impressive for what appeared to be no notes at all to be good and I didn 't even resort to the glass of wine beforehand good on you thank you very much now members we 've got _"

necessary and turn it down win also necessary so you take it away Drusilla thank you for being prepared to be here early that 's greatly appreciated by the committee thank you and well killed a few soul just introduced why I 'm doing this as I 'm actually been setting up I 'm writing an opera and working on it for 14 years and I 've been working on it for a while and going to screen Canterbury for eight years and I 'm film I 'm tuatara films and I 'm setting up new zealand green room film studio because we lost film south and screen canterbury i 'm filming 218 all over christchurch children 's production then I 've got a world war one song to do in the christchurch art center and then I 've got my opera dollar Asian garden and that 's a long term project okay on top of that I 'm su a qualified cabinet maker interior decorator 30 years community work important elections and I 've now decided there I work for Lee constructions traffic management but this is my own project i am now decided that we need to bring the aquarium to christchurch having been involved in a number of things i 'm really interested in civil defense with Canberra hell 14 years and so now we 'll get into it as a mother I 'm going to jump away because I am aware of the time and I don 't want to me I 'll give you the most crucial parts that consume me the first one being involved with a civil defense is one of my big beefs since the earthquake will become quite displaced I would love to see a map at the moment you can buy these from the council you get these free little little maps there 's nowhere that you 've got a map that tells you the highest points if we ever had an though we 're local people because we 've lost all our landmarks we 're displaced and I feel that 's a really really big thing because that concerns me if we ever have a disaster I 'll work on columbus street and i 'll tell you now seventy percent of the people i do what deal with do not know the area half the time don 't speak the language but they all know this okay the greatest christchurch regent regeneration bill must come under the local government at 202 civil defense Management Act and the Treaty of Waitangi the Royal Resource Management Act and the marine mammals protection regulations 1992 I 'm pitching the building of a new aquarium right in the middle of Christ suits right in the square and even the building of a new picture theater we look we look it 's a 22 year goal but I spoke to somebody just the other day and he 's going to look for some on business so this is why I 'm doing the submission as well action to be to be driven by an agreed strategic I do the long-term plans and I 've done in the last eight years of the Christchurch City Council the why Michael recent City Council the Selwyn District Council and I 've also done submissions to Environment Canterbury over water and the next thing that really concerns me as the minister should not have the power to suspend amend or provoke RMA documents council plans or other documents because it just makes it pointless people like myself we do submissions and submissions and then you can have somebody just come and undo the whole lot where 's the consultation we live in a democratic society the chief executive cannot carry out or commissioned works such as a demolition of historic buildings I 'm actually pitching the restoration of the old post office right in the middle of the square these things take a lot of planning and a lot of organizing and its really really would make me angry if there 's no process if somebody decides that they 're going to demolish sure that we must be a process that we can address and work together on a solution settlement a settlement price must be agreed to by all parties for land can be compulsory acquired more funding and support must be made available to the Historic Places Trust insurance agencies must be made more accountable and cannot demand the repair of community facilities when the community and the council secrets demolition example the AMI Stadium I actually did a submission on this at the long term plan the annual plan with the City Council I she used to live across the road from there ed I would never let my children go on yet even if you fix that and I 've talked to other people in the street and that 's the general feeling people want a new stadium they just don 't feel safe in the event of a national and man-made disaster that the government must give landowners homeowners business owners settlement based on current GV valuation again I 've come across people and when we had the u of cake I ended up with three people in our far note all over 75 not coping we 're still as dealing with a lot of just so even my niece she lost our house historic buildings all steps must be taken to protect and secure from further damage code of compliance example the cathedral I have tourists and people say to me why hasn 't it been protected when they did the government provincial chambers which I also that and they 're going to restore that 's actually being protected additional funding or is required for the repair of new water and service underground systems water sewage underground water mains this is a very very very big problem you may not be aware but there has been times the Fire Brigades gone to actually do a fire and found that the water pressure is not that great this is still an ongoing problem and to if you do set up your organization and you 're gonna you 're going to have to them money for funding for water for underground to fit the underground systems because what 's the point of building all these nice beautiful buildings then we have a big disaster of fire and we can 't put it out now just to center and we too and the casual street mall I work in the round that area you 've got Philip Carter spending 140 men you 've got somebody else spending 70 men and if you have a disaster and you haven 't allowed for the water you won 't get the people back even now I have people say to me I 'm never coming back into the square okay update the Sarah and immigration scoreless but they 're made by key workers able to obtain citizen I have guys over Filipino guys with different all nationalities and riggers from Ireland and some of them have still having immigration problems and I can see in the next couple of years that you 're going to have a shortage of Labor because some of these people are actually talking about going back because the economy they can single guys can come over here and maybe a guy with us wife but bringing their children and their family some of them are found at an economical because of the housing prices so what will actually happen is they will go back and community delegates as well as elected local elected candidate candidates on Community Council boards urban Annie we marry representation on community and council boards these things still need to happen because sometimes local people know just that wee bit of knowledge that a lot of people don 't know just an example I come from Bishop Dahl and I say to people did you realize that the Charity Hospital used to be an egg farm and some people don 't know that there 's just little tidbits of information so if you have people from eway area and you have a good diverse people on the council and support groups then you you actually save time and save money am i doing all right you 're going to sort of have to start just about regular that 's fine so the crunchy but now is I just believe that the big thing for me is this clause about the minister should not have power because what 's virtually saying that all our time is a waste of time you know and and we actually need to rebuild our city and one person leading the Walker and we need to bring on the community okay thank you Drusilla thank you very much it 's a good a good submission did so did you so did you know just not we 're just going to ask a question ohkura thank you for your submission first of all particularly because it 's a very much a a good sort of overview of from the coalface some ways I just had a question around do you believe that two do nemore Leiter who is actually representing the e edly you know within with what 's happening since post-earthquake I actually can 't highly enough of no time okay okay but I 'm actually over Mary I 'm shower Nikki _"

    "text": "save and welcome to the committee again we you will took the time to present to us only a week or so ago so thank you for coming back we 've got your your written submission we 've got about 15 minutes I appreciate you being nimble of foot and being ready for us a few minutes early so thank you over you well thank you very much for I saw you can understand just point that microphone a bit close here that that 's about better thank you very much kia ora tato my name 's Steven how did this John Minto we 're here to speak on and on behalf of co is submission I thank you for taking the time to come to Croatia to hear submissions and hope that you 've not already determined the outcomes but we 'll take on board the concerns of this residents and city 's citizens of Christchurch I know the people christchurch have been invited many times to give our opinion and dreams for regeneration and transformation of our sister city with about 2,500 responding to the round on this democracy return to the city and districts much consultation has been invited but little regard has been exhibited for the opinions expressed consultation needs be meaningful and not just concentration to exhaustion and that could refer to the very short notices between your receiving our submissions and as being here today we need our liquid local councils to be authorized and facilitate it to lead the regeneration and reform democracy is basic to our society and is what allows the government to claim legitimacy it should not be undermined this bill concentrates far too much power in the hands of whichever minister lee in the prime minister of points it does nothing to return the to the elected representatives of the citizens to control and planning a varsity it allows the minister to a point the chairperson of regenerate christchurch and three members and to have a veto over NightA whose nomination it excludes elixir council members from members of the board it authorizes minister to undermine and ignore the RMA and public work act and I I heard earlier the submission from the bloke talking about surveys and he he works and over it allows Minister Anna patronizing way to allow or disallow the plans made by elected local fisheries elected local government should check these plans in a transparent way to meet the needs and aspirations of local citizens and residents but not the minister 's aspirations it has been reported that the minister has agreed to the appointment of a chair to do and a deal with a mere of regeneration before the bills even passed and before submissions are heard this sort of corporatist discreet negotiation is a very antithesis of democracy it seems that the chair appointed to the AG non-existent regenerate christchurch has already discussion a revision of the blueprint while we should support the river well we would support the revision of the blueprint planning should be public and lead by the council 's alongside the coup against democracy and he can this sort of a tack on democracy is yet another example of the pushing on with a failed neoliberal experiment despite all the problems that has failed and continues to fail to address as it seems as all it seems to and assets of the citizens and residents it is also a very clear example of the concept of disaster capitalism as stated in our written submission we don 't believe that Sarah and the cartel like bodies descending from that have made useful efficient or effective decisions for the citizens and residents of Christchurch but there have been other unhelpful decisions being foisted on the citizens and residents of our city from outside I for one can 't remember any public discussion on the extremely expensive and likely shortly to be obsolete fly over on rusty road memorial avenue corner another example is the northern arterial which has been roundly rejected by the residents and cities of christchurch it 's noticeable that the pans for this will resurrected almost immediately after the earthquakes began and it was almost entirely been off the radar for most of the studies as dealing with the earthquake has taken priority while all the discussion of using rail to address the traffic issues is fallen off the radar it can only because be because private transport in the building of grandiose monuments fits the ideals listening to the cities of Christchurch citizens and residents costs as we pointed out in our submission there 's been a large text taken in flow of Finance into the rebuild which has allowed this government the clear surface despite its tax cuts and has slightly assisted sistered New Zealand 's chronic balance of payment deficit along with the failing anchor projects the inefficiency of Sarah and its substitute the city has been paying not only for the earthquakes but for giving this government a chance to declare a surplice it 's time this government came to the party and finance the rebuild properly while allowing the local bodies to lead it 's not time to further on the main line local democracy to force sales of assets of the citizens and reason it 's a great Christchurch the general tone of the bill is the further attack is a further attack on no democracy in Christchurch can can debrief the proper way of developing plans and organizing the regeneration is not to build yet another opaque and undemocratic bastard child of Sarah rather his three source and facilitate the job they are elected for stakeholder is a concept one develops from one wishes to undermine the concept of citizen democracy and we should avoid using this disingenuous term some sort of cooperation between Selwyn waimakariri district councils in the city is obviously needed to give each council the same status while Selwyn and why McAdory have only a limited number of people living in the area is not democratic but regenerate and regeneration is not the vehicle for this and no need for them there 's no need for an interventionist minister to be authorized to over oh right reasonable democracy the army all the Public Works Act in regard to the third stakeholder and the bill nope tahu with the average resident to council a ratio and Christchurch being around 24,000 if they looked there a number of councillors up amaury ward would give Democratic recognition to the talent of Inoue living within the area without giving a status to know Tahoe is stakeholder equivalent to an elected council it 's worth remembering the third clue closer to three key which gives tongue at affinia worth the duties know this umm pocket okie comes from whoa cut or nothing i do but it 's worth remembering captivate the ghoul or De Niro a una I to miramar to met important to me referral democracy and local leadership need to be returned to Christchurch thank you for your time and I hope you reconsider much of what was in this bill Thank You Stephen now mr. Manto do do you want to make any comment or no okay members questions there appear to be none thank you you accept everything we say Sarah well no oh dear oh it 's very pleased motion we you know sometimes we don 't get questions but sometimes it 's we do so thank you very much again for appearing before us twice and two weeks or so we appreciate it if the National members want to undertake to wear these t-shirts I 'm sure I could get some made for twenty bucks each thank you so much no India _"

    "text": "another one Stephen Stephen yes sir no you 're waiting you know I was getting ahead of myself because you and you 're not wearing the big t-shirt you know no it 's all right no no whimpers no no we won 't don 't panic we won 't we won 't do that to you but I was looking forward to the the t-shirt again today oh I would get Isaac it 's the big reveal okay all right okay yeah yes I don 't you know there 's we don 't muck around Colin come and take to draw Aubrey it 's sit down to we 've got a few minutes we were running just a couple minutes early so that 's unusual for us just pour yourself a glass of water and take a breath and we wait so do would you like a glass of water there 's a glass over there someone on your arm might think okay okay thank you for being here a few minutes early that 's that 's always helpful so we 've got about 15 minutes to hear from you partnership but I 'm assuming that you will want to expand on that orally so it 's over to you the more of this 15 minutes you 've been talking to us the list we will have to talk to you so welcome once again over to you Kyoto I think the written submission is reasonably self-explanatory I 'll just perhaps pick up emphasize a couple of points I 'm Colin merc and i represent a caboose group called the crisis biodiversity partnership but also involved with in support other submissions by the option 3 plus group and the greening the red zone group and also night ah who 's submission that I believe has been adopted by council without them having to make an actual oral appearance the there were five particular points that I made in my written submission I note that I 'm a long-serving citizen of Christchurch and have been recognized for my work and conservation and social activity over that period of quite a period of time including a civic award I wanted to particularly emphasized the importance and using the terminology of the bill all of the pillars of well-being or sustainability that is ecological and I prefer to use the word ecological rather than vara mental because environmental tends to bury biodiversity under the physical and and and chemical sort of aspects of the environment and yet it 's perhaps one of the most important aspects in terms of our place making our identity our unique New Zealand heritage but it 's um as I say it 's frequently lost in the attempts to achieve you know clean air and clean water and carbon balance and other important things but which lose the heart and soul of the environment in my opinion so it really harks back to the triple bottom line and quadruple bottom lines that are concepts which again seem to have been a fashionable a couple of decades ago but of largely been sort of disappeared from our terminology now we seem to be going increasingly back to a single bottom line the second point then is the restoration of the democracy to the city and to the region I think none of us can be and not able to and part of that is the loss of democratic rights particularly in terms of the Regional Council but but also because of the additional powers that the government took to themselves for restoring the city a lot of things have been unable to be sort of fully represented in a sort of an affair and informed way the the third point is really expands on democracy but more at the cut of local level it 's one thing having her vote but that is not democracy in my view and I think if we want to be a modern workable democracy as a model to the world which I think we can all probably see as tearing itself to shreds you know we have to do a lot better in terms of providing her model that is actually a real working participatory democracy and I 've laid out some sort of attributes of what that might look like and in particular I refer to a concept which I 've called a partnerships accord we 're by designated umbrella interest groups and of course the biodiversity one is the one that people he apply to sports groups or you know cultural heritage groups provided some formal standing and regular direct interaction with relevant Council staff importantly enabling co-creation of solutions to problems and conflicts and their respective domains and I think that 's what 's been missing I mean I 've been making submissions to councils for probably 40 years and one often feels it has rather little effect except through constant persistence and stubbornness and this is really pretty demoralizing disrespectful and anti-intellectual what is the point of the public training critical thinking and problem solving if it gets ignored often you know ideas that come from the community or from expertise has discovered many many years later in fact was was correct and should have been taken heed of much earlier and I can just mention a couple of examples of from my own personal experience it took ten years to finally get travers wetland to be protected and now you know the city just regards it as one of its key assets it 's taken about 25 years to get the Christchurch 360 trail finally launched and again it 's an enormous burden on citizens and interested parties to battle away for all that length of time I mean you may have noticed we 've only got one life and you know to use it all up in in pursuing good ideas which won 't be taken up you know is his pretty destruct pretty destructive ok so the fourth point was relating to specifically to the red zone land and the lower Haven river that I come back also to the central business district area as well which I have had an involvement with the importance of recognizing the the potential as a green hartree joining the inner and eastern parts of the city together generating public health recreational and cultural goals in terms of the makai park walking cycling possibly horse trails iconic wildlife native habitat regeneration the greening the red zone and greening the rubble groups working on those things and importantly again something which I 'm firstly interested in its establishment of an eco sanctuary why tecate that would add value to the city experience and national nature conservation effort and thereby nourish the providing attractions and novelty for visitors and tourists and the economy will also benefit from more informed management of these zones and reducing the wastage through more ecologically sustainable management ok finally as the mention of the avon river precinct and the eastern frame landscape plan i was involved as a consultant and that we came up with some wonderful ideas that were actually as I say signed off by Parliament and then undermined by other experts particularly engineers and hydrologists and in certain landscape architects who seem to have a lot of power and changing changing everything and we went back to very old kind of business as usual kind of ideas and threw out a lot of the creative innovative ideas that we 're in fact incorporated in the original as I say signed off design so i think really my submission is about improved faith in the community experience and expertise and accepting you know proper debate and co-creation of solving of problem solving ensuring is evidence-based i mean i realize you can 't just take the word of anyone that might pop up but it has of the people with knowledge and and and and responsibilities for managing these things and around the table together not one on top of the table and everyone underneath else underneath it so you know it 's about so true participatory representation and not just responding squeaky wheels or influential otherwise influential people who 've got time on their hands so I know of course in the media that environment has dominated the regeneration bill submissions and I guess mine adds to that voice and I think it 's some the most obvious way of referring to that as in the words of the bill bills title itself the word regeneration pretty much was a single bottom line based in it 's the way it 's framed and represented I think that 's the very important thing to incorporate to make sure that there is you know a multi multi value approach to what regeneration actually means in the city thank you very much happy to see any questions thank you very much Colin members early Christian Todd mother 's got one I 'm actually not from here so yesterday the first experience for me and obviously driving past there got a sense of the scale of it you obviously have a pretty strong view around what potential users could be applied for that how widespread do you think that viewers based on your connection with that community particularly perhaps the trail following the avon river yes well mmm over many years but particularly since the earthquakes I 've given many public lectures and talks and work in a number of different NGOs and I can pretty much honestly say that I usually get a pretty good reception too many of these sorts of ideas and very little argument with them I guess why strategic mistake is actually not harnessing all of these people that come to you 3a and Rotary clubs and and other forest and bird of course but but many other sort of more broad WEA many other sort of broader citizen groups and sort of peppering the council with government with with demands along those lines but yes I can pretty much say that that the interest in an informed public would pretty much endorse these well any other questions members no in that case thank you for what i thought was a very good because submission and much appreciated by the committee _"

    "text": "so I back again welcome welcome back thank you again for making time to be with us you know from your previous submission the process got about 15 minutes and it 's over to you sexy lover and mr. cheer and core material really more kawanatanga walkie talkie cieaura tena koe tocarte saw in cattle flubber fuckl off laga soo nice Abu Baraka Modi namaste and hey how 's it going from us it 's great to see you again for those who weren 't here when we came and spoke last time we from youth voice Canterbury is their network of youth councils come together to support regional youth collaboration I 'm from the pilot council charitable trust with Pacific young people and getting their mentor so participation and Taylor sits on I used to sit on sorry the the Y the Y mech why maka da youth council and sheen assets on the YMCA Christchurch board and which the Canterbury youth workers collective to support young people and so something that we 've been doing just aside from this build for a moment we 've been working with hoping at the end I might be able to circulate this for you to pass on to youth in peace so they can consider some of the stuff going into Parliament next year forever the bill we polled 78 young people and 56 of them gave us something to send to you or thirty percent of those participants were Pacifica Marty again a lot last time and we 're strong regional presence from right across Canterbury but then also from our city a city christchurch and going off your question last time look we looked widely around here is that we wanted to focus on turning up all night so who 's spacing this and this one too but we didn 't really do that last time we did do that this time yeah and so the first question that we asked was whether the means of the board should be elected and a significant majority of the participants did believe that the positions on the regenerate christchurch board should be elected and this came down to placing importance on values such as democracy transparency accountability and also a real us that this whole process is locally driven and that young people feel like they have a voice and that they will be accurately represented cool and so we sort of saw this as being an interesting space oddity is developing CCC multicultural strategy and I sit on that and that board that the council is pulling together strategy for next year and we were hoping that that can also help form the diversity and decision-making and we can use this board to do that too then we look talked about whether the minister or the CCC should have more seats and young people said again local decision-making as their preference that there was a perceived lack of accountability and not satisfied that local leadership being given back and 2019 is really enough and where we can make it quicker vets better in terms of that decision makers having lots of power not having a check to the courts or other process to get some sort of limiting of government apart they thought it was dangerous and then you know we 're possible we should minimalize that so we asked they thought their local decision-making should be returned to ccc and the responses were a large range of it should never have even been taken away to one two three four five years but their general consensus was shorter as better but five years maximum if it has to be that way cool and and we all know what listed about NATO whose representation but there should be from from the government doesn 't need to work in consultation with them they have the ability and they are fully capable of deciding for themselves and how they want to be due to the perception tournament on their board so your voice is really important to us and so we asked young people whether there should be a part of the greater Christchurch regeneration bill their supports youth voice on the regenerate cottage board it is important to give youth in authentic voice to express their wants their needs and their hopes for the future of Christchurch and this voice needs to be encouraged to grow and it needs to be heard by the entire community cool and so pretty much precious innovative ideas with this us um so let 's yeah let 's let 's have active places to cheer um the last lastly just to go over our recommendations yep we 've got ambitious and most coordinated yeah so I 'm sorry just don 't be hid a survey did show unclear support to have a youth position on the regenerate Christchurch board as you know the young people we surveyed wants it here and we want that to happen and there was also support for regenerate Christchurch to establish or Lincoln to already existing youth advisory groups as a way for young people have em put into what 's going on young people are the future of the city and the decisions made today will affect us long to you and that is why young people having input into the regenerate christchurch borders an important issue so you 've heard what we 've had to say but just to summarize one or two of the points again that the key one that there 's lots of diversity on the regeneration crisis board and effort can be written into christchurch occupation and age and that United can represent themselves and that the bill hasn 't mandated or looks at having youth voice in there somewhere thank you very much paul foster bells got a question purana qila fallahi added a lot for lover milo lla and get a um my question to the most exuberant submitters that we 've had today actually comes to what you 've said about night our representation and it has been mooted now that there 's a possibility perhaps that the committee might recommend an increased to representatives from the rune or is that something that you think young people would be generally supportive of absolutely yeah no we trust we trust our own occur here we love that that we can work in partnership and that 's what we do with our youth councils and youth advisory groups we hope decision makers can do there to thank you no I know 10 I 'll call who can I am I don 't just that number five here absolutely but I don 't think that there was any sort of thinking or there was their tonight on a teeter-totter and the fact is that the the crown actually is very aware of the fact is that you can 't actually you know put up say year we want to man offend or Marty representatives and by the way we 're the ones who are going to actually decide who they 're going to be yeah that was never the case there was more around you know reflection of the true partnership but thank you for going back particularly after the last time you submit it and that was my question so it 's really healthy you know to get a really good consensus that just like you 've done across the ethnicities and not just Marty but you know right across the board so good at you thank you you Jenny thank you again for the submission and you make a point that the slick muddy should allow submissions through Facebook you expand on that a bit cuz it just suggested by some of your members or is it this whole process is quite an formal and I think it 's better both I message Kelly before just to check something and she could reply instantly that fit the fact that Facebook is you know you see scroll through and you can see stuff come up and you just like a quick message or type in a response it it doesn 't mean you have to go the Parliament website you don 't have to kind of have to be deliberate it can just be something organic yeah I can 't okay you know they 're always pop forms on Facebook pages and that some stuff yeah so that the whole process can be made more youth friendly and I guess user friendly as well but we love that you guys have a Facebook page we work we were the first we were we 've been telling the local government earlier we comply select committee living on the edge I 'll tell you and so anyone in the room who hasn 't liked the local government of environments pletely too many Facebook page do so now David Lee you haven 't liked I liked it listen your fears are going online brochure yeah facebook don 't do facebook did home okay are there any other questions now in that case then can I thank you once again we you know we 're getting very familiar with a number of submitters today so thanks again for making time and thanks for promoting us as well as you do on social media and Twitter and all that sort of stuff we do our greatest and best of this thing oh thank you if there is anything you 'd like to talk to us about these palm other things please lead us know yeah thank you thank you thanks so much _"

    "text": "right good to have you so keep getting to be a regular a regular event you up some handouts good thank you yes we 're getting quite used to this room thank you both very much for being here we 've got the written submission from the Institute and now the additional notes we 've got about 15 minutes so over do you know the process thank you well that 's being ended out firstly yeah thank you for the opportunity to present to you on the submission from the Institute on the greater Christchurch regeneration bill so our principal submission principally relates to clauses 44 to 46 which deal with cholesterol surveying so the definition of property boundaries and interests and easements and land as my name is Shane Dixon I 'm a licensed cadastral surveyor under the cholesterol survey Act of 2002 and I 'm also registered professional severe worthy with the Institute I am also the chairperson of the local cannery branch of the Institute of surveyors I 've been practicing as a surveyor for 18 years and the last 10 years here and here in Christchurch national president of the Institute mac to was a licensed cholesterol surveyor and register professional surveyors he 's been practicing for close to 40 years and 30 of those and Christchurch so yeah we 're here today as representatives of the Institute and speak to the Institute submission as by way of background the the Institute is a long-standing professional membership body supporting and representing the professional interests of surveyors and spatial professionals in New Zealand were first established in 88 and recently celebrated our one hundred and twenty seventh anniversary we currently got 16 branches in New Zealand and one in Hong Kong or the membership in excess of 1300 and the cadastral surveying and spatial professions we 're also an international organization and influential too many of our overseas peers for example as an affiliated national body of the International Federation of surveyors will be hosting the Internet the Federation 's working week 2016 here in Christchurch next May the theme for that working week is recovery from disaster and we 'll be reflecting on New Zealand 's experience recovering from the 2011 Christchurch earthquakes we 're expecting many of those will be international from overseas the institute is new zealand 's leading advocacy body for professions involved in the location and measurement sciences most recently the Canterbury branch the local branch formed a working party comprising of experience Christchurch surveys to advise government on property boundary definition and the challengers Erin and Canterbury following the earthquakes and in the development of the Canterbury property boundaries and related matters bill the Institute our values our integrity and via mental sustainability excellence respect for the profession and ethical behavior in our purpose is to aspire to be an internationally recognized professional organization that promotes growth innovation excellence and community needs for all facets of surveying and spatial science in New Zealand for all these reasons the institute is ideally placed to provide you with recommendations on those on the appropriateness of clauses 44 to 46 which do specifically deal cadastral surveying we have a level of expertise that to date has not been taken advantage of and the creation of this bill or its predecessor the the 08 but our recommendations are informed and well-considered in consultation without with bill and its intended purposes in particular however we strongly encourage the removal of clauses 44 to 46 which deal with cholesterol surveying these clauses are not only completely unnecessary but actually pose a threat to the New Zealand cadastre we 've outlined our principal reasons for holding that view and our submission that I 'll briefly summarize them again here so the surveyor-general already has the authority under the cholesterol survey Act to carry out the actions that the bill purports to grant to the chief executive of lens so clauses 44 to 46 are not necessary to be able to approve surveys during this regeneration phase for the city there is a risk to the integrity of the Questor and delegating the authority to approve cholesterol survey data see it 's to anyone other than a suitably qualified person the survey general is the highest authority in New Zealand on survey and boundary related issues and therefore he or she is the only person qualified to do this and I guess in relation to that risk we 're thinking about where there may be theoretical surveys and the relation to land boundaries and emissions in relation to easements or interests in the land which could be both detrimental to the subject land but even two adjoining lands as well or in a worst case maybe even finding a landlocked parcel of land so ending up with a landlocked passenger so the surveyor-general and making decisions to utilize the exemption powers and effectively to approve surveys that don 't follow the normal rules it takes a multitude of factors into account learn through decades of experience and education and surveying he or she is required to make their decision in a way that balances the interests of the general public and the crown and maintaining the cadastre in addition to those reasons that we outlined in the submission we would now like to just see outline a couple of further drivers for our position if you 've got any questions feel free to ask away as well so then reading the bill the purpose of the bill is to provide a new legal framework to support the regeneration of Greater Christchurch over the next five years it is needed in ad in addition the objectives for regenerate Christchurch component include engaging and advocating effectively with communities and stakeholders etc and collaborative collaboratively working with others our stance is that the powers being granted to the chief executive of lens through clauses 44 to 46 will be in direct conflict with the purpose of the bill and the new direction it is promoting and particularly engagement with local communities and greater collaboration in the first and second readings for the CRA act and 2011 it was stated that the similar clauses proposed under that act and these clauses are effectively a cut-and-paste almost we 're needed to ensure the speedy and accurate reinstatement of title boundaries and for the chief executive of syrah to be able to carry out all Commission boarding works including demolition and also to enable urgent action to be taken to prevent unreasonable delays that might stop necessary works such as demolition or temporary temporary housing for example well we accept that in the recovery phase there could have been the potential for these powers to be used for example to allow large buildings with big to an ale works associated with temporary housing or the provision of essential services to be undertaken without the delay however in the regeneration phase these drivers for speed no longer exist we don 't really have any major dim elation demolitions tool to get done all essential services are in place and I in relation to temporary housing if there was a need for that going forward the surveyor-general still does have the powers to to run operate as as if clauses 44 to 46 we 're in place so there are still there that opportunity we also note that even during the recovery phase when the need for speed would have been most evident the similar powers under the sea react were not used so if those powers have not been used during the recovery phrase then face then what chance is there that those same similar powers will be needed during the regeneration phase we contend that the chances negligible and I guess you know in terms of examples I think of the was recently or lunch today at the restart more and not not that I the 60 odd containers arrived at Littleton it was all all guns blazing to get them to site and to get them fused together and welded and fabricated and fitted out and painted and all that and all that was happening and they were being placed over numerous properties with boundaries running a zigzagging in and around so that to me would have been a good example of when potentially it may well have been required but again it wasn 't you know we were able to and do it and it 's now the wonderful asset to the city that it is a up to at the conclusion if for it is absolutely vital that for the ultimate regeneration of this city for the continued protection a protection of the interests of the general public and the crown and maintaining the cadastre our property boundaries and rights and for the purpose and objectives of this bill to be truly met that clauses 44 to 46 are removed again we thank you for your time today and should you have any questions both mark and I happy to write sorry of other points just to reinforce what change be talking about and just just remind the committee that the cholesterol survey 2002 section 47 part 5 the surveyor-general has the authority to grant exemptions from the requirements of the rules and also in section 7 severe general is essentially responsible for the setting of the rules under standards and a section 9 the chief executive is essentially responsible for the enabling of surveys to be carried out under the rules and they so these existing provisions in the cholesterol survey act are really really the basis for our for our submission and it probably in some ways reflects a lot of the submissions that the committee is here during the day that we want the patent the authority if you like to be returned to the people into the existing existing situation so more business as normal as opposed to being controlled from from from afar but in just a general general comment and it 's perhaps that or it seems like in the drafting that the provisions or the powers of the chief executive of Sarah under the emergency of lens from the survey perspective now that 's possibly that 's probably been done without any any real real consideration or eternity to think about the consequences of that ad we 're concerned that although the region builders proposed to have limited tenure which which the original Sarah act head and therefore we could probably take some comfort that the powers of the surveyor-general had been conferred to the chief executive Sarah and in the same as same is happening here again it 's a five year tenure but but the powers of the severe general are being transferred to the chief executive of limbs and I suppose as a surveyor I have I have grave concerns about that in terms of where that might take us in the future and as chain has already pointed out that that we rely really heavily on the surveyor-general as a suitably qualified person to administer the cadastre in terms of in terms of the rules so and I suppose there 's an example of that you will all be aware that we are currently considering the Christchurch earthquake boundary bill and and the game changes talked about the working party you may be aware of the sector leaders group and we 've put a huge amount of work into that but I suppose the the scenario could be and that the severe general drafts rules the SG guidelines and rules and the chief executive could overwrite overall it after a silver has completed his surveys in accordance with the rules so mark I 'm we 've gone well over time and I know that David Park has got a question so I 'm just I don 't want to sorry cut me okay or too short but I know that David 's got to get it was actually related to that issue that you just raised as I understand it one of the issues that arises from the earthquake is that the land moved so people think that they 're you know their fence boundary or the natural boundary between them and their neighbors moved from the place where it 's defined in a survey sense and that you and your industry has been working through with the relevant authorities how that they should lie in practice it 's correct so pragmatic and that works just about finished you will not not not the physically doing it on the ground but the theory of of where those boundaries are moving from to the theory has manifested itself in the earthquake boundary bill and submissions are currently open for that I think they close on about the 14th or 15th and and do you have confidence that that 's going to come to an outcome that the surveyor-general and you can all live with yes I do so so is that an exam as the surveyor-general being intimately involved in there you see has we 've been perfect so is that an example of how actually leaving it to the survey generals actually it 's working out that 's Creek and also it 's an example here a local consultation in contribution from the local community has evolved herself into a bullets yeah hopefully going to be acceptable thank you okay look we 've well exhausted the time but it was hard to find a break for breathe well done good on you thanks very much we _"

    "text": "back again we had Louis here on your week or so ago welcome back close and again about your from very familiar with the process we 've got your written submission looking forward to hearing from you we 've got ten minutes thank you and welcome all to the garden city or what is left of it especially in the center to me this bill is too much like its predecessor zero though it purports to facilitate the changeover of control to the city in 2021 in my way of thinking it doesn 't go far enough for this is no longer a time of crisis but when of renewal with repairs going on new buildings being constructed our people are feeling stronger and new potential leaders need the chance to rise and the experience to succeed to me 2015 16 is the time for democracy to be restored and to a much greater extent than this bill proposes now is the time for arrangements to be handed over to the people of Greater Christchurch after all is we who live here it is we who must enjoy or suffer can see the final decision making will be made by ministers of the crown who may have never lived in Christchurch who will probably never live in Christchurch and if they do live here will certainly have conflicting interests I understand the ministers of the environment of land information and transport will be able to override council plans regional and transport plans and local policies etc they may even and i quote suspend amend or revoke a planning document including all or part of documents of the Resource Management Act it seems redzone land may be disposed of access restricted to certain areas and buildings while temporary buildings may be erected and work undertaken on public and private land through the chief executives of the relevant government departments to me these are emergency powers no longer applicable now read the crown company to be set up to oversee the so-called anchor projects like the convention center and the great sports stadium little seems to be known by the public about them except that they will probably be delayed and will put financial strain on the city even Treasury doubts their 't want to convention center right in the heart of the city a place where foreign foreigners confer for a few days and which may lie and darkness unused on many evenings making our city center a dead center I submit the citizens of Christchurch should be consulted about these centres and that the City Council should plan for them or otherwise as it sees fit it is my view that this crown company should be scrapped sailing running and possible resentment I note also that this bill requires its board to engage with communities while working in cooperation with the City Council but how was such engagement of fail with final decisions being made by ministers and with the board of seven member that members three appointed by the government three by the City Council and a Chairman appointed by the government in consultation with nataar who but I contend the council representatives on this board should have a vote on who chairs meetings and that the chair should not be appointed I fear also for the red zone the land cast is unsuitable for building on as a zone next to a park and across the road from the avon river there was a farm on the other side with cows quietly grazing it was a picture postcard a dalek this land has meaning for me and many others who share an interest in its future as shown by the fact that in 2012 more than 18,000 people I understand had signed the avin otic ro networks 2012 petition requesting that this area returns into a reserve and river park but will the slan be sold without public input seeing that such power is placed by this bill in the hands of the chief executive of the land information New Zealand consultation in the bill is constantly urged with communities with the council 's in Greater Christchurch and with parties like no Tahu i hope this bill will allow for public hearings on significant programs and also surveys of the public such as the Canterbury rugby union plans re a new state new rugby stadium for the city cities are people not buildings according to Professor Nick Tyler Chadwick professor of civil engineering at London University College and environments he is found that if people 's ideas are adopted they will make them work they may even help pay for them and it also contributes to their well-being and health so Down Goes your health budget but what incentive is there for people to put forward their ideas even when they know they can be struck out by one person indeed what a triumph it would be for both government and citizens of Greater Christchurch if roles were reversed and final decisions were placed in the hands of the council while government representatives agreed to take on consultative role this would be a win-win situation for all ministerial advice backing and support is certainly needed but for future peace and harmony we also need the desires of most of our citizens to be met but should such an idea the same to left field I submit that the new regime be required to hold public meetings on all plans so that every interested party for there are many can see where we stand and know exactly how decisions are made and should ministers of the crown continue to court environment court should be allowed to me a more collaborative and open approach is required the regeneration of the city and surroundings needs to be done at a pace that present finances allow without putting the city and a dire financial strain what will happen when most of us can 't pay our rates because of conditions foisted on us how will this help the government 's coffers think of the loss of GST this bill calls into question the control of Greater Christchurch the rights of our citizens and the interests of nataar who etc to me it needs to line up with the Bill of Rights and give the peoples who are intimately involved a much greater say Thank You Louis now members are there any questions yeah it 's very clear as was your previous submission thank you very much thank you for taking time to be with us again we certainly appreciate you making the effort for a second time in such a short period of time thank you but now _"

    "text": "submitter who is Barnaby Bennett um banho me would you like to just pull it microphone a bit closer that 's come I again you 've seen the scene the process we 've got your yet written material we 've got about ten minutes yeah I 'll try and talk for five or six minutes yeah that dolphin we can take one second what 's there so I 'm Barnaby bina I 'm a PhD candidate at a university in Sydney but I grew up in and I 've been here for about four years I 'm the co-director of a publishing company called free-range press and we published a book about a year ago called once in a lifetime which is the biggest and most comprehensive review of the recovery plan that 's taken place so far and the Press said it was the most important post-quake book published so far so I 've give we 've gifted each of you a copy of the book to have a look at its full of some really important stuff which we think over the next two or three is has what happens so I hope it 's considered I won 't talk exactly to what i wrote because I 've you 've already received it and there 's some repetition only that you 'll get today so there 's a few issues that have come up today that I 'm going to pick up on I think there 's a it 's important to acknowledge the goodwill that 's gone taken place post-quake in christchurch across the board i think everyone and using unreacted and the way that you 'd hope and expect and I think sarah was it was a part of that there was a real need for strong governance and in a place with the particular democratic makeup we 've got that was really important and I think that took place and all across party there was really good support and I think there 's a lot of criticism of Sarah but we forget to probably acknowledge the important things that there wasn 't population flight there hasn 't been massive capital a version of the city there is some confidence building in the downtown and generally of sense of normality five years on which an international level is not bad given the scale of the disaster that had well saying that there 's obvious real problems and I think this bill is a really amazing exciting opportunity to pick up and learn from the mistakes inevitable mistakes for the last five years and pick up our game a little bit to me the really significant problems almost all stem around the notions of participation engagement and the role of the citizens and what 's been happening so I think financially there 's been too little investment and there 's still a big struggle for investment I think that 's acknowledged there 's been really big delays to the projects that the crown is lead and some of that 's inevitable there 's been and I think there 's a real lack of there was a 75-percent of people on a recent press poll said they don 't understand or feel that there 's a strong vision for Christ 's Church which those things combined when a crown agency came in to take control to set up as a failure of that agency and what we 're doing now has to take on board those problems I think I think a lot of it stems from understand misunderstanding what engagement is I think the left sees it as a human right that needs to take place to have democracy and the right sees it as sort of something that 's necessary but is often a hindrance to the progress that 's needed in these circumstances I think on the first level there 's the the role of the public is sort of like a Geiger counter for issues and problems and when that Geiger counter goes off when there 's an issue of whether it 's the residential red zone whether it 's problems with something like the convention center whether it 's EQC you don 't get rid of the Geiger counter because it 's causing problems you actually look at and let and let the things bubble up and let them become part of the democratic processes you don 't stop consulting which is what we 're pattern christchurch the second one is local leadership in the last five years and there 's plenty of them just went to restart more for lunch and it 's booming it 's as full of people and color and life you go to new Regent Street you go to the gap filler projects you go down to see one anywhere around the city with his life it 's either buildings that managed not to get demolished or it 's temporary stuff that have been post-quake and that 's five years after you look at the Sierra lead projects out of 1893 have been completed with infant with in the within the two and a half years of the ccd you 've been you been established almost all of them have been delayed there 's significant worries about three or four of them ever happening so and if you look at the other local leadership things about the art center and isaac theatre royal a lot of them are led by strong groups they understand their role they have public support they 're able to get significant investment on board that public support because people get it and they really even though the procedures a bit weird i think Andre Levitz a really positive step I think he 's a great person to put in the position the last element of an engagement that I think there has been messed substantially post-quake as I 'm is the psychosocial role of actually enabling people to participate and contribute to the visioning of their city and the Prime Minister 's science advisor advise of Sir Peter gluckman explained it very clearly and may 2011 after the quakes at one of the big dangers easy disempower people for further by not letting them participate and the reimagining of this city and if you go back to the 18 anchor projects I think three of them have had some sort of minor citizen engagement in them and there 's a book Charles Montgomery visited about a year ago and nine months ago I think and explained very clearly there 's a lot of scientific evidence now that the process of enabling people to engage makes people happier in cities even if the outcomes don 't change it 's important stuff of the issues fully support is the re-engagement of ecological and environmental concerns in the city I think if you look out well I think we can look back in 40 years like we hope to and I think it 'll be the residential red zone of what happens or that that will be most proud of but it needs to engage with the ecological environmental status and presence of that place is a huge issue and I think the community appeared from that this morning I just like to quickly pick up on there 's been understandably there 's a concern about the 16 or 17 billion dollars at the Crown 's put in and that there needs to be some oversight for there and that 's fear it 's a massive amount of money I think it needs unpacking a little bit though if you look at a substantial amount of that 's EQC money which is an obligation from a completely separate bill that 's got nothing to do with this so that has it you then break it down into skirt which again that money is almost all been progressive reasonably world so they almost haves it again then there 's only about three or four billion that 's actually been committed so far and that 's and very tightly contained projects that are already committed to that don 't need more government oversight that 's like the justice precinct to convention center and things like that there 's no need to control the rest of the city to protect those projects and Crown codes been set up specifically to look after those investments and on top of that a huge amount of Maddie 's been comin into the government through GST and tax and take from this rebuild I think its a 50 billion dollar rebuild Texas a significant part of that so a big part of that money as the hard work the industry the the community engagement the sort of life of Christ Church in the first place so I question the sort of logic of needing oversight over the whole city because of an investment when you break it down a bit I have a few more minutes I think if it 's to be get over the community needs to be present is the three stakeholders which are really important the crowd and the council and no tahoe I think the presence of the community and the people within that it needs to be not forgotten that there 's and the goal of Christchurch and the potential of Christchurch is that we can be world leading in the stuff we I don 't think the skills have really been there so far I think sarah has been remarkably poor at that I think the council has been a little bit better but I think there 's an extraordinary amount of potential and there 's a lot of people training themselves up about how to get better participation and this bill is incredibly exciting because it 's the potential to unlock that finally I think we can all look back in ten years and think this is the moment where we actually their potential grow the key thing to that though is trust and I think I call on the committee to to support the government to support the Prime Minister to support the minister a leap of faith with the community to the people that have been talking to and who they represent and who you represent and to have a little bit of confidence that we understand the issues I think you 'll get that today no one understands issues more than concerned communities and that we will elect the right people we will harass and we will lobby and we will produce when things are going wrong but we also have the best interest of everyone at heart and there 's the sort of magical thing waiting to be unlocked I think of this Bill 's framed in the right way and put in ministerial control and positioning over every point of that place is just going to continue to frustrate and slow down and you hear that again and again how the bureaucracy how the minister signing off is restricted and chords I think cause real damage to community in the last five years and it other the final commuters it 's not that 's not a comment on the people within the bureaucracy or the minister is the systematic setup by somewhere else it 's accountable that 's successful and there 's endless reports of post disaster situations only working when they 're locally led the Sarah 's own documentation for the transition bill said there there 's a submission you 'll get from a doctor in Auckland who talks about he 's got 35 years worth of experience he talks to data the book has about four or five he says that talk about it only works when it 's locally lid there 's a systemic problem here and you 're here today about how to resolve it and I 'll leave it at anything finally thank you very much time probably for one question if there 's one in that case it 's too quickly up I thank you that was really refreshing actually to kind of hear you know that there are things that have been identified as actually working and obviously you know when you actually compare this I just see in your book there 's a part there on in Italy makula and you know looking at a country with the resources that Italy has happened there and it 's been over like 10-15 years so when we liken ourselves we kind of beat ourselves up I suppose you know in New Zealand but people overseas look at us and think well well you know like look look look what 's happened in that short amount of time so i think come to that you 've reinforced actually what the mayor was saying this morning is that we have an opportunity here you know to actually be able to put in place some world-leading legislation in implementation you know basically around picking up on some of the things that have happened good things and some that haven 't been so good and let 's work on that and that 's what we 're trying to do with this legislation so cure to thank you and we appreciate the quarter as well thanks know me Barnaby thank you very much we appreciate you taking time to be with us today for your written submission and for your clients interviews thank you and the book and I think the next person is Jessica holiday from Tepito he you want to situate yes oh absolutely come on come on up that 's no prob cool Jessica welcome thank you as with Barnaby 's so we 've got your written submission or the Trust 's written submission and weird like now to hear from you great Tina koto cord Jessica holiday tour cahuenga core a hotel I hired a orte puta he christchurch center for architecture and city making i would like to thank you for the opportunity to comment the trust would like to thank you for the opportunity to comment on the greater christchurch regeneration legislation in thank you for coming to christchurch to hear us that really does mean an enormous amount and we wished a puta he wishes to acknowledge the government 's commitment to the recovery of Greater Christchurch i 'll tell you 1st a little bit about ourselves so you know who we are what we 've done and what we do and then i 'll make just one point hey puta his purpose is simple our co papa is to grow people and places together Tokuda he has evolved from festa the regeneration event which we have presented three times since 2012 it 's now biennial so we don 't present it again till next year we work collaboratively with a wider community of creative people who make fester and together we have fought over 60,000 people enter this otherwise largely empty city since 2012 we create instant urbanity we connect the community with the inner city support andesitic businesses and entrepreneurs end and doing this catalyzed change in Christchurch auto kahe toh pooja he is an independent place where people can connect and grow their aspirations for our city it 's a place where people can experience new ideas connect with different partners and community and enrich their understanding of how we best rebuild our city and how they can apply there understand through their practice as citizens or built environment professionals we want to work with the government and with regenerate Christchurch to find solutions to the challenges we are facing in Christchurch auto tahi now and into the future how we all work together is the most important aspect of this legislation and I get the sense that that one point the legislation should reflect the positive scenes positive scenes that the communities and people of Christchurch want to be actively involved and participate and the regeneration of their city people here are eager they are talented and they have over the last five years accumulated a wealth of experience and expertise the government should want to use these people and in its current draft the bill doesn 't adequately represent the strong potential in this city I would like to highlight the risk you 're taking your proposal isn 't neutral to our proposal of an improved approach your proposal encourages Christchurch to feel as people they are done to not as citizens active in their own lives and cities this is a message you 've heard all morning and that we are hearing too how about in the frustrations of people from outside Christ you from example Auckland and the frustrations they have about us this disempowerment of citizens has been shown globally to stimulate a cycle of victimhood and a cycle of entitlement to public services and in the long term will require significant public investment the bill harness the energy the commitment the talent and passion of the people that live here the solution does not lie solely and appointing or employing those people directly somehow it 's about developing local agency and power through your legislation that 's key to bringing those two together those employed by central and local government on regeneration and local citizens and so we are somewhat confused by the current approach it isn 't reflective of best practice as Barnaby said best practice globally and locally and in fact the proach we should be taking is already modeled in this country and the Tamaki regeneration it exemplifies the sprit best practice of harnessing the local community and should be the model for our regeneration thank you thank you very much now other questions members you journey um thank you could we have a copy of your presentation email it through the school but the Tamaki regeneration what is it there is that the in terms of the joint enterprise to develop housing is that the principles on the legislation principles and and it 's then also the development of develop those with the community I mean it there 's no provision in this field for a statement of intent no yeah so and and if you re i 'm a nerd I 'm sure you 're all familiar with it but developing the Tamaki way of working we 're keen for an auto tahi way of working with the government there 's been a thing that 's gone through most submissions that 's far and as somebody who 's not from Christchurch I 'd like to I guess ask you around ask you your views on whether you still can connect effectively through your established relationships with the City Council and then of course potentially through the draft process that this bill enables wants a draft plan of regeneration why do you think that someone such as passionate as you and as articulate as you can 't use both your in those informal relationships and then the formal process is outlined in this bill to have your voice considered as part of you know the many hundreds of voices of what the future of this city should look like does sign off on all those plans and it isn 't detailed in the bill what other ways other than the existing ways might be used to to connect with people a minister signing off does not necessarily mean that the view that comes from the gravel up as the previous speaker spoke to cannot be part of what gets signed on I think a lot of our fear comes from an effect that we 've lived through the last three years of many many incredible projects not been signed off and been squashed around interim used round round local businesses leading stuff around different ideas to the city plan that would have been cheaper that would have been easier that would have been really good for the community that have been either lost in the bureaucracy or specifically not signed off because of political fears by the minister or people within various parts of them so that 's why we have a little bit of worry about the ongoing continuation of that role because we know there 's look there 's so much energy that 's gone under certain have them as a result and if you look at that map over there all that blue area the government owns a lot of the city there 's a lot of resistance that can be put up with which one which doesn 't need to be a bigger I think in which if done in a more sensitive where it could be really open up the city quite quite quite um magnificently and I just to finish that I think there 's also alleged opportunity I think it could be i think the links between regenerate christchurch and its processes and decision-making could be could hook us in in a stronger way it 's not just what it does do it 's that it 's there 's a missed opportunity here Jessica Barnaby thank you both for your time this afternoon and for the material and if it you put them Sydney Ellen we should thank you very much now can i call _"

actually oh very good like I love the the consistency of the message it 's coming out of the people of auto titans oh that 's good let 's go okay well over to you welcome again Kyoto koto good afternoon committee thank you for the opportunity to speak you have read a significant number of submissions expressing a desire to reconsider some aspects of the greater Christchurch regeneration bill to direct the minister to accept amendments to the bill that enable greater locally lead change and increased responsibilities and development decision making an action by the citizens and institutions of auto taki Christchurch over the past four and a half years we have generally endured and occasionally rejoiced in much that has been done to us by a top-down central government organization I acknowledge that this was essential in the first two to three years of life and post-quake Christchurch however handed back to its citizens local government bodies and the numerous community focused organizations and institutions who live work and play in auto tati our place right from the outset from the community engaging and possibility celebrating share and idea initiative the people of Greater Christchurch have expressed the desire our willingness and need to be involved in the recreation of the air city regrettably much of this work was dismissed as the hand of central government rewrote the rule mini canterbury and still feel aggrieved at not having been listened to your having their ideas acted upon but we cannot change the actions or inactions of the past aside from property developers much of the local population is disillusioned by the process and actions that have been put upon them from on high to solution by the limited opportunities of meaningful Civic discussion engagement and action by with and for the people before tote a key thankfully the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority sought to address this operation error by initiating a consultation process in july of this year seeking feedback from the citizens of Greater Christchurch and what they led Earthquake Recovery Authority and April 2016 as you 'll be aware the overwhelming desire by respondents is for the citizens of the city to have a greater involvement in its recreation championing a locally led approach that commences as soon as possible not some time towards the end of the next five years as you 'll be aware the draft transit plan published recently by syra states for recovery of a city to be sustainable in the long term needs to be owned and led by local communities and institutions I especially appeal to the ministers who call this region home I go from the last hour since earlier Luka Rocco Joe Hayes met Dulce and Eugenie sage to advocate unswervingly for this locally lead option to take effect much earlier than outlined in the plan because there is the citizen lead community collaborative gravel up organizations that have kept Christchurch on the map both nationally and internationally not the top-down government projects the international spotlight continues to shine on us due to citizen-led community engagement and the resulting projects that have kept the visitors coming from near and city have the capacity to lead the city towards being the amazing place we all want it to be just a note from my submission so it is on the record where is the empathy the biggest anchor project in the city is debt treaty Treasury 's analysis of Christchurch 's economic state of affairs has been dismissed by Minister Brownlee and discredited by the finance minister who actually wrote as you will know the forward to the report managing government investment projects 2014-15 let 's have a central government politician who actually likes people working with our city leaders Minister Simpson balla foster bell Parker vitally Shaw and mark this is a question of political affiliation there is a human story regardless of the right left red blue green or black I appeal to your humanity to your empathy to your heart do what you know is right to recommend to the minister that central government relinquishes its control of the city by the end of 2017 giving back great Christchurch to its citizens I 'm proud to have been involved in numerous projects that have kept the heart I trust that the recommendations you make in the days ahead to the minister will have you all also feeling that you have honored the people of this community that you have done the right thing water tally Christchurch this is too long a why why our place our home let us be the ones that make it work thank you thank you very much no members are there questions paul foster bill presentation thank you for the promotion to minister but most of us out on the cider Amir back benches look I just wanted to respond to one point and knowing both Minister brownlee n Minister English personally I think it would be fair to say they are people who put people and human values at the centre of what they do so you obviously have an opinion on that but that my experience of working with them as they 're very centered on what what works for people here rather than buildings land and the more materialistic bellies have one question if I may well it 's more a matter of us hearing your thoughts and views it 's still ticking and my question was and it was to the parliamentary officer who is communicating via email with us i was curious to know who your advisors our i believe that after this sort of series that you go through so the advisors what is their background so do the visors want to speak I just be curious to know what your server your legacy is twelve of the advisors unfortunately don 't have from speaking my could use their outside basics i can i can tell you that they are from the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority we 've got principal advisor about acting advisors chief legal advisors we 've got a whole range of advisors actually i 'm not actually i 'm not even leading reading from the right list but they are all hard-working and diligent public servants professional and experienced and their roles and is there a community representation on that advisory panel you 're at you 're the we hear submissions from any and all community people that want to want to them participate and from that next level though they 're people which who are from Canterbury that 's the beauty of our intimate precious little democracy fantastic treen thank you for your submission I very much appreciate you taking time to both write a written one and be here for us today I 'm now going _"

    "text": "oh yes good afternoon and welcome thank you good to see you we 've got the written submission we 've got about 50 martes fantastic you know the process yes familiar with it over to you lovely thank you on your hands well we 're delighted to be able to come and speak to your today and in regard to the greater Christchurch regeneration bill so Ellen and I represent the Signum quarter incorporated Alan 's the chairperson and I 'm the secretary very convenient it 's it is it 's great works very well um so the Sidon quarter represents the business owners in signum area and we 're requesting that the regenerate Christchurch bill specifically assists in the development of the Sidna master plan as a guiding document or a blueprint for the future regeneration of the Signum area the pseudonym master plan is a document that was drawn up in 2012 for the future rebuild and recovery of signum and for those of you who are from out of town signum is similar to you brighten and the amount of damage that 's occurred there the master community and by the cinema community in association with the community board in the city council and the master plan has been adopted by the council but like all the other suburban master plans it doesn 't have the level of detail which would allow it to be incorporated into a district plan so essentially while it 's a well-researched and inspirational plan for recovery it 's toothless it needs to be developed to the required level that will allow it to be an effect of guiding document it is the request of the sudden and quarter that the greater Christchurch regeneration bill be adapted to incorporate this development process for the plan and that this development be undertaken in an inclusive process with the Christchurch City Council a community board business owners and residents as cooperative partners now we would just like to give you a the Select Committee to specific examples of why it was so important that the mast of it that the sudden a master plan have some teeth in the plan the northern and southern the ends of Colombo street within signum would it be the north to it from the south and to north as a gateway to the central city the Gateway areas were detailed as part of the action plan for the pseudonym area and if you refer in the Signum master plan to Clause II 5 page 38 you 'll see that however as the plan isn 't able to be enforced earlier this year the area designated for the Northern Gateway was developed into the enviro waste refuse transfer station this happened even though David Mountford the Commissioner responsible for the resource application detailed the guidelines and aspirations for the gateway area as set out in the master plan and as report and took into account the concerns of the whole salon community if the master plan was regulatory or guiding document the refuse transfer station would never have been allowed to happen the second one is the redevelopment of buck and park is also detailed on it as an under in three page 55 of the master plan currently there is the diverse debate within the community over a land swap sell proposal for a Sikh temple on this Tory document this proposal would have been less contentious there would be clear guidelines for the council and for the community to work with so as you can see from these two examples and believe me there 's plenty more the master plan absolutely requires this development to a level where it can it can become the document that it was designed to be if you 're in any doubt about the requirement for this we 'd recommend that you take a drive down Colombo street north to south through signum and there in mind that the northern area is the gateway to the central city and really that ends our submission we we envisage that a process could be put in place that where the the community would have a bye in and work with the council with the regenerate group to develop a firm process and a firm way forward for acidnam but for also for other communities as so much if it went into these wonderful books and they really are what communities want but we can 't have them because there 's absolutely no power in knock here 's one no your submission I 've got a lot of empathy actually for a few lines particularly in signum the Colombo I thought was you know a really perfect start um you know to this development and then yeah just I mean looking at the involvement I had a little bit of involvement in the weigh station but was it was it David mouth Oh David Bedford it was not much David Mountford that was the council the cat because it was in two parts yeah there was part that we can and part the went to the council so he can decided on equality right and the council decided on traffic movement okay so so David Mountford was on the on the council 's he was the council commissioner okay so look again thank you because you have highlighted the fact is that you know those plans do need two teeth maybe some support they really do so think about I met I have do so so just trying to think pragmatically forward so that was included what would be the but yet the outcome I area like new brighton is included and thinking why not our area and then week lose your area is there a benchmark for brother your ears to say what about us i mean does that that 's become unwieldly i mean how do you preg matically approaches you then I don 't think it 's well we 're only talking about sitting them for a start yeah you know and and that 's the main thing sudden them as we see it as like that document that was done by the council done by everybody as an absolutely amazing document if had some teeth but but it 's got no teeth at all when and hair could at let you know how could a transfer research station be put right in the heart of the city you know and and and it was all to do with the fact that at ticked all the boxes and nobody got told about it you know and and I can go on and on about how it happened and what we tried to do to stop it but we couldn 't do a council had no teeth because at meet within that criteria the railways that were supposed to perform part of the railways other it has nothing to do with with any work associated with rowers but they 're able to leave it as an industrial building and and you know like it 's it 's it 's not that good actually yeah it was really demoralizing for said number to be perfectly honest and that 's why you know we 've come to speak on that you know if ours and theirs and ours have been put into that book why cannot be a guideline on some you speak you know I do i do see that perspective to that does that open up a can of worms and as every community going to be in the same boat possibly yes possibly yes but but if we 're looking for a plan going forward and for the city easy and surely this is the place to start david pugh the mirror when she appeared earlier expressly made reference to send them and the possibility that they could be a candidate for section 93 of the Act allows the governor-general to change for ad if you like areas like that you know they could they could have if the powers-that-be wanted to in the future they could say well they 've done you bright and they now should look at synonym and there 's a mechanism set out and the Act to allow sitting them to for example be added at a later stage and do a regenerate plan wonderful that 's amazin plated at the stuff yeah the possibility exists or that sort of thing to be done in the future which could achieve what you absolutely that 's great news David okay members are there any other questions in that case then Judy can I thank you on behalf of the committee for taking the time to be with us and also for the submission pretty useful thank you thank you very much _"

time you spend speaking to us the list will have to engage with you so welcome i saw in our rocket utica committee pitifully or padam et toi ET regeneration bill finance Rick 's Gibson on the coke one of the co-chairs of one voice the real guitar he in that group which is at last count 106 community groups and small NGOs which have come together and they 're on the register that 's on the submission for you I represent aruna Tokyo to Tokyo Kai Tahu and to say there 's one of our hundred and six organizations we 'd like to speak from the communities not for the communities and I 'd like you to sort of take that on board that I 'm not speaking for them I 'm speaking from them it 's our hope that your work on this bill in its final form will focus on the written submission our component groups are passionate about seeing explicit recognition of the third sector and the regeneration process in a similar way to Peter 's final comments here a minute ago they want to be involved I was heavily involved in the immediate post great response work managing and coordinating 60 agencies mostly NGO from our base at rio mariah from bberry right through the from the September right through the fee Barry and Beyond activities in Billy ever hear that was for the support of migrant refugee communities and the post-quake period the most important immediate support support conduits came from the offense lease and their communities and particularly their community organizations this is who we work primarily with these have been the most effective communication channels and both disaster and consequent rebuild for all those communities and many many more our groups want to see the regeneration bill provide public acknowledgment of the role of the third sector if not only in the disaster response but also in the recovery and the future of resilience cleaning we also want to see the community definition broaden that of locality we deal with place-based community 's interest based communities and identity based communities local manager and the government is vital for access for our organizations community board member city councillor etc and their staff exists to do that work they 'll ever make the affected population are directly accountable to them there 's a lot of cynicism among their members that they come back to the the old statement of a central government agency only has one client it 's minister they want to work with people who are accountable directly to them I guess the alternative to that has continued harassment of the poor old in peace and Wellington every time there 's an issue that arouses their pensions the research under the all right mental health campaign showed that rebuilds Andrey generations cost less when people affected share the values and purpose of the plans the communities know their needs and they want recognition for the arose they also want to support the processes that 's why the roles of the third sector need to be included in the bill members of our community groups and works and then they want to participate some already assist will have done significantly and probably more effectively than some of our disband public servants have been able to know I can give you INEC total examples of their ad infinitum communities need rebuilding just as much as your infrastructure does in the city we read zoned 11,000 houses now that meant we relocated between 33 and 44,000 according to my estimates of people across the city that 's the population of any average provincial city in New Zealand who we relocated this tore apart community groups from recreational groups to social groups the cultural groups to social service agencies the c koi put huge pressures on the suburban communities that received them and those evolving in the new subdivision they feel they therefore have a right to be involved in the regeneration and the planning side of things we suggest that you look closely at the opening section of our submission and that is the things that we support and hopefully find a way that you could include some of them in the way in which you would the curl thank you very much Rick 's now members are the questions get a knock where lyrics thank you for for the submission actually because n for highlighting the really important role there NGOs particularly actually play within this now you know understanding that the bill itself provides a kind of a new legal framework to support the regeneration in remaining rebuild work the other one neighboring local leadership all this but and I suppose there is sort of one part you know particularly it doesn 't address things like sort of community well-being and things like that but I believe that that is picked up around the sort of community mind strategy so without actually looking at sort of direct recognition you know within the bill under the purposes do you think that that 's what you 're asking for isn 't it we well we 'd certainly like to see the full well being transferred into this and cemented in this is as part of what we 're asking okay so the other thing I just so this your organization is actually based out of river so that was based in the work that I was doing work for the organization i was working with at that time no we don 't have a base okay we don 't even have a bank account we we just come together okay so it 's in collective it 's a collective bound collective of a hundred and you know just over a hundred community organization small NGOs ok so we Brandis here we 've run a series of forums over the last three years or so on issues affecting communities in the groups in to give them credit all Amir 's Sarah you can those groups have all been ready to come along in front up and out here Bennett has come as well to to communicate we become the conduit for that communication for community groups with in the past particularly with Sarah and with any other groups that have been doing the planning okay thanks very much there appear to be no other questions so rigs can I on behalf of the committee thank you for being with us today and also for the written so mushroom with call to the table please empowered Christchurch Hugo Christensen _"

    "text": "this Eastern vision Peter beak and a Humphrey Ralston good morning and welcome oh no good afternoon it 's just struck past this this is a great room we in peas are slightly envious because it 's better than most of the rooms that we have to use in Parliament but it lacks one feature which is a clock at the back of the room for the Chairman but that 's a small matter and when I will take up the who worship when i get a chance seem to remember we did have one when i was a counselor but there we are yeah it 's actually quite handy but anyway so now we know it is the our own welcome thing and we 've got your written submission we 've got about 15 minutes yeah over to you how we use their you know you 're both familiar with the process welcome accurate Otto know how I found out you a tonic 10 I coq10 now coq10 narcotic until zdenek on it I eastern vision was established to seek to develop an integrated vision for the eastern flatlands actually was not looking for the next five to 10 years but for the next 50 to 100 years and to come up with a collaborative integrated plan that would enable us to to make the very best out of that environment a lot of that 's picked up in our submission to you I just wanted to note that I 've been here most of the morning and virtually I 've been hearing from all of us back here more or less the same things and we are people of Christchurch Canterbury saying we know what needs to happen here and we know what needs to happen here is that this the next step needs to be much more locally driven much more locally driven with appropriate community consultation I have to say many of us who battled along with this for the last five years have not a great deal of confidence that this bill is going to enable that to happen some fine words but actually not very detailed in the implementation about how that might happen and that our experience overall has been that we 've Sarah and some extent the City Council in fact as Evan said earlier it 's those of us who community leaders who have actually been able to advise zero and others about the better way to go about community consultation so I just said that at this point what I 'd like to do now those two passing of the Humphrey who has passed out this document to speak Thank You chairman I we that we 've just handed out a three page well have we ended up most of us got copies Clayton your journey here you need one yeah anyone yep one pop you know it doesn 't matter there are in fact 12 copies so there should be enough um mr. chairman please keep go right there are two matters that that we would like just to share with you and hopefully get some questions back on at a high level and the first is the actual ownership of the red zone lands as one question and the second question is around governance and if if I could possibly start with the latter question and just make the Sarah act and in my view 4 for 12 months 15 months it was an appropriate piece of legislation and the crime was outstanding in the execution of what that act and what the needs of the community were subsequent to that it really has fallen to pieces and there isn 't in my view it 's fallen to pieces is that for some reason the government decided that that didn 't need a governance structure to oversee this this department and so when you have that situation you get gaming going on and you get politics going on and we the people of Christ have really had a second-rate outcome as a result now that 's a fairly broad statement but in my view it goes to the heart of your this new bill which are bringing in and no doubt for good reasons and logical reasons it 's been deemed appropriate to bring a new legislation and for the first time it has a governance structure attached to it but if you read the bill I would say that this governance structure is is going to be many parties who are able to interfere in the process that would drive a sensible chief executive nuts quite frankly having to work with it let alone their board and I for the life of me I don 't understand why the crown on the City Council don 't have trust in appointing competent people to this new board and trusting them in the same way that disruptive technology trusts its new participants to deliver on the objectives that both the City Council and the crown wish and to set out those objectives and simply say bring in planning that will achieve those objectives and this paper here has given some thoughts to that which hopefully you guys can take away and and build on but if you look at central Christchurch it is not succeeding politicians tend to think that new buildings going up equals success well I can assure you they don 't they can actually equal agony for a lot of people what success means is people elected the customer elected to want to come live participate learn play and be involved with the city and around percent of American cities and thirty percent of German cities just in two countries are failing today and they 're failing because of lack of good planning and they 're trailing because bureaucracy and officials get in the way of the customer so you 've got a wonderful opportunity here mr. to introduce the governance structure which can do the job for you and if it was my decision I would say to the Council on to the crime you 've already agreed on the amount of money that you want to spend in Christchurch we 've had that debate we 're sick of it why don 't you just allocate that money and get out of the way and hand over to your newly appointed chair and presumably his newly appointed board to come and a competent chief executive and let them get on with the job because you will find that the people of this city will respond very positively to that forum as against the form of Sarah and bureaucracy we 're sick of it it 's easier to take our capital and go to London there 's such a simple job that the land area within the four avenues is a property development deal and when you consider and I 'll just say this and I 'll get off my chest but when you consider that the crown in their wisdom thought that the skill set needed to replan and rebuild the city New Zealand second largest city were the skills of an auditor I mean it 's really mind-blowing that that you you the crown could have come to that conclusion I mean it as well mr. stupid is saying that you 'd put a dairy farmer in charge of the emergency department of the Christ Hospital it 's just not logical so why don 't you trust a governance structure you trust it with us OES you trust it with other other areas and the same principles that would be adopted and used by that apply to the red zone Lance so if you have a good governance structure in place they will get all the answers from the community they 'll make it painless you 'll get a sensible recommendation they 'll have time frame that is perfectly appropriate is no hurry here we can take a hundred years to do it but what we want is for the job to be done for so that is our plea with the bill to change this definition I it 's perfectly appropriate for all these local bodies and everyone else to have input but it is not appropriate to ask a competent Ford and achieve executive to come to a logical planning conclusion and then have that overturned by minister or other officials it is not logical and you will not get good outcome and the center of the city demonstrates that today so this my plea at the ownership of the red zone land I think should be really really carefully considered it can become an asset as precious as the botanical gardens and hagley park it is a tourism acid it is a community asset and it 's a unique special opportunity to do it so bring allow your new port to bring forward sensible ideas and you 'll find that in my view it 'll work thank you both very much board to bring the sensible ideas and progress i guess it raises the question me is why don 't you have confidence that ultimately those who will sit around the regenerate crush due to a kind of reward will not be of sufficient capability humility and community connectedness to be able to listen to the myriad of suggestions for how to regenerate christchurch in a way that you can ultimately support right well I totally respect that and if they will put it there will be capable people so why do you the bill why do you want to put interference in their way why do you think it 's necessary for for for the minister for the bureaucracy to have their own agendas relating to what the board is recommending well I don 't want to get into a one-on-one debate but i think the crown on behalf of its 16 and a half billion dollar investment into this town has an understandable expectation to be heavily involved and how that regeneration should occur what will you do from your community sports respect I don 't think the Crown they you have wasted an enormous amount of money and and one of the reasons you 've done this is this very reason that you haven 't had a governance structure so you 've gone down certain lines of of approach and that 's fine you 've gone down there but it has been history will write it up there 's been an extremely expensive exercise in an unofficial exercise I understanding is that the crown will have two appointees on this board so they will be part of that process the other bit our experience over five years has been that with the best will in the world it just hasn 't worked and it 's been an issue from the very beginning assistant stomach failure in the whole area of is the fact that there wasn 't aboard as I go between place so it 's great that this is being put in here but as you can hear from behind me here and will no doubt here more off today especially for those of you where christ church people we 're asking that we be allowed to and we 're perfectly competent to do that Clayton Clayton if mr. Ralston could I ask you have you considered a B plan by that I mean whilst I I do support the vast majority of your views on this the reality is that Isis peak those across the table not personally Babs but the government will rain was through and I think that 's I suspect being a cynic you 'll get very little change therefore would you accept or do you have view as to whether as your proposal whether some sort of lesser proposal halfway house and adequate that may be in terms of partial transfer of power if the government could be persuaded of that do you have any ideas around that that may bring us closer to the outcomes you seek but there 's no transfer of power going on no I accept that if the crimes that 's looking 16-day no no and I 'm saying if the government was a mind to of a mind to amend the bill not to the level of the proposal you wish but who mended to so to what we 're being examining today with the ledge of the draft legislation well so the it comes back to trust me so Todd you have said do I trust the new board yes I do so demonstrate that trust by empowering that 's all I 'm saying because you won 't get best outcome you 'll just get average outcome if we carry on the way we 're doing we have lost so many opportunities for real quantum change which would have cost nothing just real planning changes that could have been made it should have been made that haven 't_''_869.76 been made because there wasn 't a governance structure now that 's coming in all I plead with you in this legislation is trust the new board and allow them empower them your rights how to set the directors so just preserve that right and you 're in control but but so it 's as simple as that no you 're the shareholders so you don 't need any compromises we 're sick of compromises David yeah have you seen the flow diagram that 's been presented they 've essentially said is rather than giving the minister the right to veto the outcome of regenerate plans or indeed regenerate or indeed the formulation of those some of those plans they say that where it falls within the end but of or within the area of the christchurch city the the regenerate board should take that decision with crown representatives on it who as you say can be replaced by the minister if they 'd if the minister 's dissatisfied with them but that then the regenerate christchurch board effectively holds the pin makes the decision and in the end i think the the minister in a regulatory since has to write the plan into law someone else to would that go some way to make your you know absolutely that the key issue here is not just happening you 're bored I mean people are not going to put a whole lot of work into it and then just find a saver turned by third parties who really don 't understand when this is my understanding mr. chairman is that the region regenerate christchurch board is a not that it 's not going to build the convention center it 's not going to do both the library it is a planning board and what we 're short of is planning why is there no capital flowing into the city when the earthquake money is finished i can tell you there will be very little of any real capital and there 's only one reason for that and that is because the planned isn 't good enough so it 's quite simple if I could just respond clone to what you talked about the plan B you look at the submission you 'll see the fun for the term minister we suggesting that that may be the minister of the great recovery also the minister of local government and the appropriate mayor of whatever particular district so that is not simply a minister the minister includes those those people in making any of those sorts of decisions I think before we finish I 'd like to just say that in support of all that Humphrey said the other bidders I guess if I wear one of these things city I know there 's a considerable number of people who continue to agonize whose lives are devoting our part of those communities I 'm thinking particularly the East but around the city it 's not just about the financial bottom line it 's about the social emotional psychological health of our city and one of the reasons it 's in such a bad state at the moment which it is and there 's more alert evidence to prove this is because we haven 't felt included and we haven 't felt truly consulted and that 's is where we need to be going with a better system of doing it than I think you 've got in this bill at this time and it 's probably a good place to finish the submission thank you both for your time and appearing for us today and also for your written material we appreciate thank you very much can i call to the table _"

    "text": "have been circulated with a further sheep during the break we just head we 've got about 15 minutes so even over to you welcome the killer um thank you very much for this opportunity I am coach hero a Minotaur crew network i 'm also here as an x rayed zona so i went through the Reds only experience Edna taco network is primarily focused on the regeneration of the Eastern flat lands and in that in particular they even attack Kuro residential red zone lens and would include South Shore within that as you 're probably aware there 's three distinct areas of red zone lens and Christchurch the brooklands red zones portholes and the over Notaro so this is focus primary on Abe Notaro I thank my colleagues and fellow submitters that have presented before me here and we had a consistent theme running through this and I 'm going to add to that now that natural environment and natural and environmental regeneration must be part of the purposes of the regeneration act the act as currently drafted repeats the same mistakes of the draft recovery strategy included we need to protect nurture and restore the natural environment in the regeneration of christchurch by giving it space to regenerate itself similar to our HD has just been saying so that in turn the environment can protect us from natural hazards and nurture and restore our community well-being particularly of the most impacted communities in the east of christchurch to be truly sustainable economic regeneration must be multiple bottom line it needs to include environmental cultural and social as well as financial donations the second point is around a recommendation a very strong recommendation that the crown writes off the red zone lens and we want to put a slight revision to what we submitted in a written submission I 'd like to read the wording of that this has been developed by our colleagues and Eastern Division Eastern vision has a remit which is somewhat wider than the able attack red zone lens but we work closely together it is our recommendation that the crown be asked to write off its remaining dollar investment in the Ava Notaro red zone lens and then transfer its ownership of trust with settlers wishes that at a minimum require the trust to protect preserve and develop the site for best community use in consultation with the community and that if any land are subsequently resold or net proceeds are paid to the crown from our point of view it 's extremely important to retain the integrity of the city to see corridor that runs along the overnight a crow River is imperative that purely commercial driver 's dunno do not take precedence over environmental cultural and social benefits which is very significant and quantifiable economic value and actually alluded to some of that previously we recommend innovative approaches to increasing housing stock and improving property values in the Eastern flatland suburbs in the long-term approaches that do not require very costly land remediation and do not further expose communities to risks of natural hazard we 're being through in a very traumatic experience those of us that were red zones along the eastern corridor there we don 't want to see that repeat that that repeated in the future for our children with ear for do not favor significant residential these lands are not just real estate they 're not just part of the crown estate they are part of our collective experience our emotional me and our neighborhood and they 're part of our backyard when we want to say in their future there is need for clear leadership and a great vision for Christchurch the recovery to date has been characterized by a lack of cohesive collaborative leadership although I must admit I saw signs and a glimmer of hope in the words of the mere this morning and I hope that continues and is realized and there 's been no attempt by central local or regional government to develop a unifying overarching clear vision for Christchurch for the eastern suburbs or for the red zone lands let alone one that includes and has agreed by the people of Christchurch the only leadership and vision that is emerged has been from the communities themselves the egg must provide for this to be acknowledged to be embraced to be empowered and to be resourced because without any support for community leadership without an agreed vision that that we all community ownership will lack integrity will lack direction and will lack sustainable momentum in short it will fail local communities must be at the heart of the regeneration there is little provision for communities to participate in regeneration as as as it has currently drafted limited public consultation where we get an opportunity to comment on a predefined planned doesn 't cut the mustard international best practice community engagement is necessary it must be required by the act that must be meaningful accessible inclusive and have influence it can be all of these and still be focused and be expedient this kind of consultation is not inclusive or accessible not many people have the confidence or the the articulate enough to feel comfortable in the situation I don 't feel comfortable in the situation it 's very intimidating this is not consultation is about in either an hour experience neither sensual nor local government can can engage with communities well again the best examples of good community engagement have come from the communities themselves and good examples of that and the recovery has been their works and efforts of concern allowed to re-engage with the red zone lens for the past four to five years the public has been locked out of the vacant red zone lens and there have been good health and safety reasons for this however those lens have now been cleared then there 's no real reason that remains for those lens to be no men 's lens and be continued to be a scar that runs through the heart of the east a daily reminder of what happened five years ago if communities are to be activated to participate and informed future use discussions particularly around the red zone lens then they must be allowed to re-engage with the lens locking them out of the lens is not the answer interim access to the lens must now be um now be not unreasonably withheld interim community uses should be encouraged and enabled and resourced without this community well-being will continue to be heavily impacted and social regeneration will be impeded in the eastern suburbs thank you even thank you very much members questions look thank you for you for your submission and even also with the involvement particularly around the environmental part of the regeneration do you think though in the because this bill really supports okay the regeneration of Greater Christ shoots through and there 's a cup of poop there 's some purposes there two of them I thought that was really important particularly where the previous submission your submission is coming from is around enabling community participation and the planning of the regeneration of Greater Christ shoot so that community participation and then recognizing the local leadership actually within there in that sort of strategic partners so there are sort of two or reading that actually covers you know even though it 's general am i hearing that you want to exit a lot more specific within the purposes yes it within the purposes you 'll see in our written submission will ask for a sixth purpose which is the very first one which focuses on the regeneration of the environment and social and cultural regeneration we think that needs to be specifically mentioned this purpose because many of the powers depend on whether they are actually fulfilling a purpose without it any other powers to fulfill any purpose that which involves regeneration of the environment or in the cultural or social regeneration okay can I just one more quick so within that the sort of inclusion as a major stakeholder of tuning or NATO you know as part of one of those great drivers around environmental regeneration I mean go back to the night o who claimed it was based actually on that environmental protection of resources landscapes and that so do you think that that actually having to do nhung 180 who there actually is a big sort of step forward because particularly when you look at those areas that you know you operate him I mean go back to nineteen fifty-six_,_642.77 when under the capital under the Public Works Act the final sort of remnants of NATO who land in that area was taken to build the Bromley sewer plan so that 's why I 'm saying is that is you know the more input you know particularly from NATO who would be important particular when you look at historical I was absolutely agree with that and that 's envision as the restoration of a hanger Kai throughout the Kuroda and throughout Christchurch and we work closely with my Tahoe and NATO hariri in making a que exemplar project for example it ends at dr but yo certainly or knowledge there and it does give us some comfort that night out who is one of the partners in within the regenerate cartilage proposal but we would still like it explicitly mentioned that the natural environment needs to be part of the regeneration process okay Kuro well I quit last quick question you joining um thank you even I 'm given the 18,500 signature petition the very poor quality in the DeCaro avin which was front page of the priest yesterday why do you think the that Sierra and the current regime has ignored that desire for a river park and has spent so much money in the central city rather than on the whole length of the river I think from the for the for the past five years the emphasis has been on the things that can be done quickly it does we do appreciate it does take houses and then providing doing further treatment to the land so they were not necessarily happy with the type of treatment that 's happened we 've certainly been advocating strongly for attention to trees and and the encouragement of regeneration of native flora and habitat but I i think the the the city did need to get on its feet and part of that is the the CBD don 't think any of us five years ago thought it was going to take us this long to get this far we always thought something would happen soon I think to be realistic it 's still going to another three or four years before we see anything happening on the ground that 's all we think interim use for the red zone lands is really critical for those the well three of those communities and that 's going to be requires some funding and support from from from central and local government to make Adam a copy of your presentation to please sure even thank you very much for your time today we certainly appreciate you presenting on behalf of the you very much thank you very much appreciated like to call to the table now please Environment Canterbury professor Skelton and Chrissie Williams _"

    "text": "birds HD Campbell actually but i 'm not from forests and food oh so it 's actually Campbell and Percy it 's a joint submission absolutely and Jean welcome both of you and we 've got about 15 minutes we 've got material from you over to you welcome well and see you okay thank you first I want to thank the committee for coming to Christchurch to hear from the people here about how we want our city to regenerate i 'm here with jean miller canterbury conservation manner from forest and bird furstenberg joined the submission because urban vivacity restoration as one of their priorities with many of their 70,000 members and supporters actively involved urban regeneration projects including around the history and christchurch the greater christchurch regeneration builds states it supports the regeneration of Greater Christchurch while we do not doubt that this is the sincere intention of those drafting the bill there is a glaring omission and its purposes the bill fails to prioritize environmental regeneration today I 'll focus on why that matters to the people of Christchurch and gin will explain why it 's a way that protects and enhances biodiversity the people of Christchurch have pretty definite views on what we want for our city and one of the things we said consistently in every engagement is that we want a green environmentally healthy and sustainable city we have experienced firsthand what happens when a city buildings without considering the environment we don 't want to experience that again if there were no other reason why this bill must prioritize environmental regeneration that would be enough but as it is there are many other reasons why it makes sense to do so as the environment holds the keys regeneration on so many other levels here are just a few examples in the past three years there 's been a thirty-nine percent in recent adults into staggering sixty percent increase in children and adolescents accessing mental health care from Canterbury dhb that 's more than 700 adults and more than 300 children above and beyond pre quake levels every month that will be costing the health system and the justice system and the education system a lot of money using a study published in fewer people living within three kilometers of a green space needs treatment for anxiety and mood disorders such as depression and bipolar disorder and every one percent increase in green space is associated with four percent less treatment for anxiety and mood disorders it also showed that green space people can freely access has the most benefit in large areas of green space give more benefit overseas the Wisconsin population study shows that the links between green space and mental health are significant sizable and show up no matter how you measure them environmental regeneration is essential to improve Christchurch 's dire post-quake mental health issues then this physical health this month the global study revealed that New Zealanders are couch potatoes and don 't exercise enough yet a study done by dr. Suzanne balanced and Peter Tate of Lincoln University has shown that an eco-park and the avon river red zone would save 50 point three million dollars a year and public health spending as a result of increased exercise that 's thirty 2.7 million saved every year just from people walking through an eco-park another 16.1 million saved through increased jogging environmental regeneration and the avon river red zone will improve the ethical health of Christchurch people there 's another way that environmental regeneration will improve their health and well-being it 's been said that each year 150 people died earlier than they should because of Christchurch 's winter air pollution problem a study published in urban forestry and urban greening in 2009 showed that trees remove about 300 tons of air pollution including p.m. team from christchurch every year and that air pollution as much lower and side bracket and bush then immediately outside it other research shows that forests remove more air pollution than individual trees and that evergreens are more efficient at removing winter air pollution perhaps unsurprisingly the Christchurch study concluded that the earth evidence for and I quote the mitigation potential of New Zealand evergreen species that could be used by urban planners to help improve air quality environmental could regenerate encanta cleanup price Futures ear we haven 't even got on to flooding a major issue and the regeneration of Christchurch and protection from sea level rise you all know that wetlands know that only two percent of Christchurch 's historical wetlands remain Christchurch cannot truly regenerate while a large proportion of its citizens live in fear of flooding every time it rains regeneration of just some of the lost wetlands will provide a cost-effective reliable form of flood protection for many of those people and of course it will also help to clean up the water quality and our rivers then there 's the fact that most Christchurch children grow up without ever seen a tui more pork or Kira roux in their own City how can we possibly consider that that 's okay gene cure a cure everyone cure on up I 'm as as you sit here to represent for some good my presentation will focus on the medium the short to medium 10 minutes went Christchurch is a uniquely bite of this fight obesity it ranges from our coastal and Esther own environments of dry lands and to the forested areas and the port hills it is habitat that provides habitat for many rare and endangered plant species and animals these are our Tonga Christchurch resins have a the regeneration of Christchurch it is a simply unacceptable in forest and boots view so fail to consider biodiversity protection and enhancement as a primary purpose in the future act that your committee is currently considering the christchurch community must be meaningful meaningful ins consulted on how they wish the avon south shore red zone to be managed local harrisonburg members are weary of arguing for real democracy to return to our city and the wider Canterbury region to ensure biodiversity protection is not continually undermine it was just a week or so ago that our forest mood was here arguing against what has been proposed for Eakins from 2016 in the short to medium to lynn 's will be managing that the red zone areas on behalf of the crown in our view they must be specifically directed to manage for the these areas for biodiversity values and the community needs some assurance that lens will be adequately resourced to be able to do this and the port hills I 'll give you an example above dubbed in space there is an extensive area of qe2 covenant this is properties one of those properties is now in the red zone lens will have a statutory responsibility to manage that covenant for its biodiversity values and will certainly have a responsibility and manager to ensure there 's no weed inclusion that 's going to move over to the adjacent covenants now there also may be others other covenants there may also be sites of ecological significance that are now in the Christchurch replacement plan that lens will have to manage for work for their biodiversity values up to now serious management of the urban South Shore a red zone has been to mow to engross the area I think around about four million dollars per year what we are seeing is an extensive increase in the number of canada goose because clearly it 's ideal habitat for them what that will mean apart from the impact on the water quality that the geese will have ultimately this is going to be quite a huge boat security issue for lens to men it 's because the coal geese in the urban area is going to be highly problematic there needs to it needs to be happening very soon it is also clearly really goes against the wishes of people to have that area managed as biodiversity park so when you 're sewing and mowing you are reducing opportunities for seedlings to to regenerate and the other thing that 's happened since the earthquake is that this areas of the Avon area that hasn 't been managed properly by City Council this may be something that even or Target or address but these include some really problematic weed species that will become a problem in for instance that the red canary grass which which you know really enjoys areas has become massively problematic and the one on law lagoon further south near tomorrow it can and the Department of Conservation and volunteers that spent many many hours many thousands of dollars in many years actually trying to clear it out and you know the positive thing about the earthquake and what 's happening in the eighth and such will read soon as we sing species return that we haven 't seen before you 'll be or commonly before you recently be aware excitement and rightfully so Christchurch people as you heard from Catherine Bates previously have made it clear and actually have made it clear that they want their even red zone to be a place where our native plants and animals can thrive in areas water quality can improve the bill must include in its primary purpose the protection enhancement of non-native plants and animals as part of our city 's regeneration and our people must have opportunity to heavily say about how this will occur once must be directed to consult with our community on how better to manage to a van red zone and be properly resourced to ensure that biodiversity is hearts they maintained kilda thank you very much make one final point if I can yes it will need to be quick it is okay so the people of Christchurch have said over and again that we want a city that 's not just economically thriving but that 's socially and environmentally sustainable you have the power to make that heaven please use that power wisely thank you very much we 've exceeded the time but to submission we were told by syra staff that they 've consulted a lot of ologist I biologists technical specialist and there are a lot of there 's quite a lot of vegetation that 's been left in the residential red zone so why why hasn 't that been enough I think I can answer that because a lot of the vegetation that 's been left has been cared for or is being cared for by a group that I belong to I 'm called green in the red zone they are small patches they are discrete patches and what 's been happening outside those pictures is actually quite shocking there 's one example that I can think we are on the corner of river road and glade f there was significant natural regeneration of koh phi pittosporum others like cabbage trees galore it was thick it was dense it was outside the fence and I went along one day and it our all being chopped down so basically your submission is because the syrah legislation doesn 't include any real reference to natural environment there hasn 't been a requirement the piers and yeah and and people need to be instructed specifically to do so thank you and on that note I 'm afraid we 're going to have to draw the the submission to a close but thank you both very much for your written submission in for being with us today we appreciate it thank you I 'd like to now called in table _"

    "text": "see if we can find a council good morning Catherine welcome you 've been watching proceedings we 've got about 10 minutes members have read the written submission that you 've provided us with over to you thank you hello my name is Catherine Bates I was born and raised in Canterbury and lived here most of my life and I 've lived but although I loved else we have at times I 've now been living in Christchurch for over 10 years thank you for everything this bill up for a submission process I just wish like the submissions for a key and that we 'd all been given a more time to do so and that this process hadn 't been rushed on just before Christmas when people 's focus is elsewhere however my submission differs differs slightly from my written submission today but it still covers the same topics the next step in the way the city 's revival is managed as an important and crucial one I am pleased to see that the bill marks our step away from the previous model of government government dominance the short time given I tried to get my head around the bell and what each part said and then what each part meant I apologize if I 've misinterpreted clauses or intent or perhaps offered impossible alternatives but I 'm not an expert I 'm a frustrated and demoralized citizen of Christchurch who would love to be happy with the creation of this new entity regenerate Christchurch if it went further towards a real regeneration but like the government 's undemocratic plans for econ I can 't_''_111.03 let this pass without making my stand I oppose the greater Christchurch for in a generation bill as it stands because it does not address the needs of recovery or regeneration of Christchurch in terms of true social local input and engagement and regards to Governor it reads as a continuation governance it reads as a continued nation of the status quo under sara and does not do enough to move the governance and control away from central back to local government or make enough provision for community engagement and regardless of the general points within the bill first of all local local leadership of Canterbury Regional Council Christchurch City Council 's cell in District Council terror una nota who and why matter area district council by providing them with a role and significant ministerial decision making processes under the bill I advocate that local leaders be the decision makers from 2016 not the minister if this bill truly recognized the importance of local leadership than these bodies and organizations should be making the decisions being the decision makers not merely being provided with a role in a ministerial decision making process by allowing these bodies to have a full and active role in decision-making from the outset the crownless desana turing by not allowing these bodies to have a full and active role in decision-making from the outset the crown is dis honoring the tenets of democracy and making a farce of local government and the ability of a region to manage its own affairs if the crown would truly devoted to crush it to recovering in a timely manner and able to now regenerate it needs to take a step back and allow the city and region to do this in central government over all the explanatory notes go on to state that the bill also recognizes that an atypical and transitional role of central government on the regeneration of Jack greater Christchurch is expected to continue for the next five years but will progressively move towards crown and local government establishing roles and responsibilities I advocate strongly for our local leaders to be the primary leaders in the regeneration of Christchurch from 2016 that is unacceptable that the process of transition from crown to local government control continues for the next five years it is time that central government allowed the natural progression of regeneration to occur to be it 's lower than they wish but at an achievable and affordable rate under a democratic administration it has been already been five years and we in Greater Christchurch that 's beyond the central city has seen very little progress and regeneration of even the simplest things like a local dairy as the Crown 's focus has been on progressing the rebuild of central Christchurch powers I advocate that the minister is not the holder of power over Christchurch and executive regenerate Christchurch may be the ones to exercise that power as it 's recorded and the explanatory notes however no one person is to hold absolute authority of these powers and the use of these powers must be in accordance with consensus from the mere the cheapest Emma chief executive community engagement I advocate strongly that the spell enables direct community participation and engagement and the planning and the regeneration of Greater Christchurch especially by including publicly elected members to the board additionally i would like to please include a definition of community participation and engagement and part one preliminary provisions clause for interpretation since the objectives of regeneration christchurch state that is to engage an advocate effectively with communities community stakeholders and decision-makers to achieve its purpose and to collaborate collaboratively work with others and achieving regeneration it would be pertinent to say how that engagement and collaboration is to be interpreted and the affair how it might be implemented by regenerate christchurch in order for this entity to the ruler truly reflect christ church and the wishes of its people it needs to include the people not for developers but citizens of the city who represent different sectors I recommend that the membership of the board comprises seven members as follows two members appointed by the Christchurch City Council and two members appointed by the minister and two members who will be publicly elected and one member appointed not by the minister but after consultation with terror oh no no no Kavya and of course yes of course those elected members may be the same ones that you could have appointed but at least they 're elected by the people we have had a say on the process as for a successor organization if there needs to be such a thing all is 99 for regarding section 56 of the local government act 2002 which is that there will be consultation required before council controlled organization as established definitely applies to the establishment of a successor organization and why is it a given that there will be a successor organization anyway if there is no change to this how its put in the bill already and we have to wait until 20 21 then I strongly suggest establishment of status of region are at Christchurch that arm and from the close of 30th of june twenty twenty-one the purpose and objectives of regenerate christchurch are to be continued jointly by the christchurch city council in the canterbury regional council scootin five provisions applying to the relation in relation to regenerate christchurch part 1 general provisions regarding the chairperson of the board and my written submission i had specified that the chairperson of the board will be elected from among the other appointed and elected board members as outline of clause 95 for the period inning with the close of 30th of jun 20 21 yet only last week it was announced that the chairperson had already been appointed can I ask a question and I 'd like an answer now how is Archie 's person to be able to be appointed for an entity that doesn 't legally exist yet can somebody answer me that no the role of the committee is not too hard so questions that we 're here again we 're here to hear your self nobody here 's a question that you may hear you hear your submission so what 's the point of the submission process of it 's already a done deal and regards to schedule for regenerate christchurch area i 'm glad to see a focus on the east christchurch but i still believe that the delineation of the area 's proposed creates of piecemeal regeneration of the city by effectively ignoring or east of the city needs even if just for the time being especially those suburbs on the east between central city in new brighton who are already quite neglected and would generate more divisive nurse from within those suburbs and possibly the city the entire city needs a comprehensive development plan which allows focus to be intensified with the need is greatest but at the same time addressing the regeneration needs of the whole city so my suggestions are to change the area 's focus to part 11 suburban r energy regeneration focus on economic and social hub developments and all suburbs where people live and local shopping hubs and amenities which were badly affected by the earthquakes and have have have not or only partially recovered please do not ignore how strongly people feel that many parts of this should never be rebuilt on and please consider the wishes of thousands of people who signed a petition to for this land to become the avon river park part to New Brighton as its proposed in part three christchurch central city as its proposed currently under part 1.1 of schedule for and finally i 'm very concerned that there 's no mention of the natural environment anywhere within this bill then my resin submission I asked for the very least mention that provision be made to include protection of the natural environment and the purpose and objectives of regenerate Christchurch I 'm doing the submission as an individual and my biggest concern is the lack of community involvement and this organization and planning for Christchurch but I also belong to the avenel takara network it 's a group there 's been advocating for years now that the red line zone lands along the river be turned into an ecological and recreational reserved for the community to protect and enhance water quality biodiversity and recreational and cultural use our work and the wishes of the thousands who signed that petition and 2012 presented to a previous incarnation of this committee asking for such a part be recognized as a serious and achievable objective regenerate Christchurch if this body still has a pressing need for anger projects then this should be at the top of that list thank you for your time I hope you take what we 're all saying on board Katherine thank you very much with well used the ten minutes but I can see a couple of members hero for questions no fall festival on in Clayton she thank you for your presentation you focus quite heavily on PEP 's the crown having too much say um but as a non Cantabrian and I 've got many colleagues here who are Cantabrian do you think we are also stakeholders given sixteen point five billion of taxpayers money from throughout the country is coming into the province and in particular those those cornerstone projects those major projects that the crown is investing in we as taxpayers from elsewhere should should have our I suppose right to some degree I acknowledge the contribution the crown was made has been amazing however I do think that the local input and those anchor projects or you know was completely ignored I think that once the anchor projects will put on the table as the blueprint we 've had no say and what they are and whether we want them and I don 't think that 's good enough and I think that regeneration is to address that Cleveland look if worries me and thinks your submission but it worries me that you it 's a lot mischaracterizing your submission that you seem with your reference to the appointment of the Chairman do I personally think is a good choice but I can assure you you probably do too yeah that 's not the point yeah so is it is it your contention do you believe this is this process as a Farsi essentially aura or a process well if I make us a motive sorry or a process of just if you like going through the constitutional motions to to get people to submit given that there 's been yep I do I have seen and I sorry to be cynical but you know this whole Sara process his fam attack box engagement when it comes to community and I think that it 's it as a faster thick the chair has already been elected yet I was able to submit on that part you know if I put a particular point in my submission regarding that then you know then my house of mushroom as a fasten everybody else 's as if everything 's already been decided Thank You Katherine thank you very much for your time for your submission we appreciate you coming and presenting to us today Thank You members our next submission is not due until 11 15 so i propose to suspend the meeting to give members an opportunity we 've been sitting since we 're ready for a short break for the sake of members so I will reconvene at eleven-fifteen _"

to thank the previous two speakers I supports their submissions and they were great thank you I 'm just speaking from the heart today and I speak on behalf of New Brighton project which is a nonprofit organization that works to strengthen enhance community in your brighten my colleagues and I live and work in New Brighton within the regenerate Christchurch area our children attend to the local schools it is our community that has been enduring the never ending road closures detours broken bridges in the demolition of hundreds of houses it 's our schools that have been damaged to the last five years and are now merged or closing it seemed to have been very little in the way of public consultation with many of the decisions made by for us by higher authority is our view that the recovery to date has been done to our communities rather than with and people for a locally driven recovery we believe that this bill will significantly affects the future of Christchurch in a specific especially the eastern suburbs recovery in the eastern suburbs of Christchurch has barely begun and yet to the crown are still persisting with extravagant anchor projects for the center city it seems to be very little data to back up these n business projects we 're concerned that the new crown company will continue to be secretive as sarah has been and the public have frequently expressed concern in frustration over this we believe that a collaborative vision and strategy will be far more effective for the regeneration of Christchurch we seek the increased democratic planning processes we feel that the bill as it stands continues that anti-democratic processes sorry provisions in the syrah actually override the resource management processes we need local democracy back and Christchurch this can be greatly improved by these changes to the bill having the council take over regenerate Christchurch earlier than 20 21 we require that regenerate Christchurch have public hearings on all plans and we want the council to be responsible for no reference to their environment in the bill the health of the environment reflects the health of the community the communities of the East have experienced a long waiting game for roads to be reopened schools to be closed demolished and rebuilt community centers to be built master plans to be completed life as usual has not been easy five years of perceiving ruin and neglect and the slow replacement of the damaged red zone in our area has not yet led to recovery our communities may be resilient but it has taken a terrible toll on many psyches after almost five years we 're still restricted from access to the now park like red zone lens that are on our doorsteps seems an analogy for the recovery as a whole we r affected communities are refused participation and key decisions over our future landscape there 's a real need for the community to get back into both the red zone lens and the processes for future decisions road access to New Brighton currently travels along and through the red zone we want to see that and activated by reserves conduit from the city to the sea would to see the red zone made into a river park and reserve the land is so significant to its former owners into the communities that are adjacent to it that and there was real considerable interest in its future yet the bill as it stands has no strong commitment to consult in implement public views in 2012 over 18,000 people signed the Avon or Target or networks petition asking the government to turn the red zone land into a reserve and river park with a home win the homeowners have left the land is so so so important for wetland restoration and flood mitigation measures that are essential for the future health in the amenity value of the river and the surrounding areas we seek changes to the bill to promote the establishment of the river park in public use of the land excuse me sorry in summary we support the development of a strong community and council lead program off recovery one embraces democratic process and gives ownership of the city back to the people we acknowledge the considerable investment that the need for communities to be an a to have meaningful influence in the future to regeneration of lens that are so intrinsic to the health and well-being of our communities we want hope we want healing and we want to help achieve it we thank you for your time and hearing us today thank you 0 now questions members you Jane thank you for the submission why do you think the natural environment has been totally missed out of the purposes of the bill given that there was that 18,000 signature petition which came to Parliament and given that the AV node Kara projects had it had very high profile why do you think the environment natural environments totally missing I honestly don 't know because the red zone is incorporated into the machinery at Christchurch area of interest and yet it 's an economic opportunity that seems to be lacking thank you Joe what do you think that regenerate new brighton would be a believe that that area of interest will probably be concentrated to the central business district of new Brian rather than the actual river and your very passionate as submission is I look at the framework that 's proposed I can see you know some opportunity for genuine engagement for people like yourself in your organization I mean at the front end the representatives that SAT round reject produced room regenerate Christchurch obviously include the City Council and and others and others the strategic partners from what I understand although I 'm not from here there are some very strong City Council and community links that I 'm sure will help build a picture of what regeneration could look like and then of course subsequent to all of that there is you know public consultation on the draft plan which I 'm sure you will also participate in does that give you you know some comfort that you know your voice can be heard part of what will be I suspect a pretty intense community debate it does get some comfort that we want we do want to ensure that there is really really the Rope up or IV of the regeneration bill okay understood thank you thank you to there appear to be no us this morning and for your written submission we certainly appreciate your taking the time to do so no worries thank you thank you very much and I call please to the table Katherine bait _"

    "text": "for wanting earnest welcome thank you you 've seen the process we 've got about 10 minutes we 've got your written submission over to you how we use the ten minutes but as I 've said to other submit as the more of it you 've been talking to us the list we will have to question you so welcome once again Thank You mr. chair person members of the committee first of all I just like to say that I 'm an immigrant obviously and I came from a authoritarian country having grew up in Taiwan and lived in three different countries I like to offer a bit of a unique perspective from my points of view there are certain parts in this bill that greatly concerned me that I think personally should not even be in in the Royal books of a Western democratic country the regeneration bill it 's not all about quick recovery obviously and as a member of the quake outcast group I have been deeply involved for the last four years in three court battles against the government 's unlawful rezoning of the unlawful by our office of our land and house the jun 2011 cabinet decision on a red zone was the turning point as I see it the government embarked on a campaign of misinformation intimidation and coercion and to try and get residents to sell their land and houses to the crown well it may very well suit some people but I think given the full range of choices I think a lot of people will think twice about that but that aside that 's water under the bridge I just like to say that since the Supreme Court had already ruled that the rezoning process was unlawfully made as a resident within living still living within the residential zone I have had to enjoy years of uncertainty years of stress and sleepless nights having to worry about whether another government or even the council is going to shut off my water sewer and power or exercise power is within the syrah act or the next regeneration act to compulsorily acquire my house in my land now I have up keeps to though I need to do regular maintenance and make my house in good standing leak-proof weatherproof order these are nuts you are you know five dollars to dollar weakened jobs that you can decide on a whim I have to think in some serious money to do the upkeep so do I spend the money to maintain my house or should I just let it rot in perhaps you know because the government might take it one day and I 'm not going to get one cent of my money back I 'm sure this same scenario this the same dilemma faces a lot of federal rate owners that are still living in their own homes in this upcoming new regeneration bill contained within a lot of new powers that was now that weren 't even included in the syrah act that allows in particular allows the minister to decide compensation whatever the minister thinks fit so I take particular issue with that particular phrase because I think that should come out of the blue book of a third world banana republic not New Zealand I think another part of the bill that says what ought to be and illogical reasoning on the part of certain circle within the government I mean why does what does it matter that where there is something ought to be insured or not and who decides what ought to be insured what ought not to be insured and what does it mean to be ensure what sort of insurance policy are we talking about exactly are we talking about fire theft and other natural disasters or some potential government taking off your private property I am now aware of any commercially available insurance policy that one can purchase against the risk of government taking your land so that particular sub-clause 79 b3 was poorly written and the intentions are unclear I can 't think of a reasonable explanation for that and I think given the track record in the history of this government over the last three and a half years I can I I can think of one good reason why it should be there it 's probably clearly targeted at people who are uninsured or self in short if you call it and still remaining and owning private property in another part I have particular problem with is the power as the powers that allows the chief executive and minister to close any rows in restricted movement within a great great of Christchurch area I think there is no there 's really no good reason for such extraordinary powers to be included in a bill that 's five to ten years after the earthquakes so this is the spirit this bill lasts for another five years I I 'm corrected am I correct so ten years after the earthquake you want to give a minister the power to close any road restrict movement of private citizens within the whole a big chunk of Canterbury what what could a legitimate reason could there be it 's a great it 's a grave infringement on our civil liberties and I think it amounts to wartime powers in peacetime it 's just there 's just no no reason for that so these are great powers that are proposed to be given to the minister and the chief executive and with great powers come great responsibility and with great powers that there is more committee that please reconsider these specific clauses that are included in my submission and us this ask yourself this question are these power is absolutely necessary or are there other mechanisms that by which the objectives of the government can be achieved you have a responsibility to ensure New Zealand does not drift into a realm of a third world country by upholding the law and pass laws that are of genuine high quality so I asked you and I employ you two to consider and ask yourself this question what legacy are you leaving for your children and grandchildren and where you stand up for what matters thank you thank you Ernest you 've nicely timed that exactly to 10 minutes but if there are any urgent pressing questions Clayton you could I just ask you what do you what do you perceive as little government 's rationale for retaining the substantial powers that has anna legislation and its unwillingness to substitution or transfer substantial powers to the community at large if you do you believe the motivation is well I can only guess that the government wants great track record given the stress and hardship that I am others in my group have endured I think there is a sense of wanting to tidy things up and tie up loose ends and not wanting to lose faith perhaps do you believe we have sufficient people of skill in this province if those powers were transferred wholly or partly to to execute and manage those powers for the benefit of our community absolutely there 's smart people everywhere and people were our community minded and selfless and we just need to make sure that we find a mechanism to find these folks thank you I think it has to be very quick I 'm just in terms of your concern about the minister having the power to determine whatever amount of compensation he or she sees fit is that partly based on the quake outcast case or cases and the the ministers the arbitrariness in terms of determining the compensation that would be paid in the residential red zone for bacon and uninsured leaned well I can 't speak for the minister but I but I can say that Magna Carta as in our Western and be going democratic basis so yeah it doesn 't belong it 's out of place it 's very odd they should not even be in a in a law book at all Thank You Ernest on that night we 're gonna have to finish so thank you very much for your written and oral presentation today thank you appreciate greatly can I call to the table please _"

    "text": "looky please hola welcome you 've been watching the process we 've got about 10 minutes we 've got your rhythm submission which you can assume that members have read so welcome once again over to you thank you thank you for the chance to speak to the bill so my name is Lyle at looky I 'm a crisis resident and I 'm also the convener of the annual seismics of the city events which have been running for years since 2012 well we know in the wake of the quakes of two thousand and ten and eleven we 've had response and recovery and now it 's the tune of regeneration the three hours and perhaps time to get back to some of the the basics I 'd like to reflect on the different meanings of the word regeneration for example and biology the restoration or new growth by an organism of organs and tissues that have been lost removes all injured in other words an internal organic approach to repair and growth not an external grafting on or in electronics regeneration has the meaning of a feedback is feedback to the wood circuit to reinforce the input and the word to be able to bono the essence of feedback is that the effect of an action is fed back to alter that action this sort of regeneration depends on raising the depleted energy levels of the people of Christchurch which in many cases have degenerated along with much of the city by a systems approach to capture and reinforce their positive inputs and also to take account of negative but constructive feedback we all know that city regeneration is not just about building tangible structures that was good to see some emerging of the skyline they may be the most visible signs of progress but it 's really also about developing the intangible assets a city 's public spirit it 's self image how it sees itself it 's attitude to creativity and innovation it 's trust of the powers that be it 's access to genuine open two-way communication and the strength of our cities and tangible assets will be reflected in the health viability prosperity and sustainability of the city as marvin weiss board said sure you 've been hearing from other people that many people have been have felt disempowered because of their quake in their post-quake experiences there 's a need to rekindle the kind of an engagement and enthusiasm of shear an idea but at a different level the level of shearing a vision cheering strategies and the president press campaign is helping there but the strands need to be woven together into a meaningful pattern with some higher-level thinking which is the point of our annual seismic and city forums which involves representatives from the public private and community searches because we know it 's the people of Greater Christchurch and especially young people if we can retain the Italians in the city who will have to live with the results of present decisions so we 're building a new legacy for christchurch-based we hope on shared visions of strategies but perhaps those have been rather hard to be to see in recent high a well-designed and well-executed envisioning an engagement process as community building by itself while there 's been some post quakes consultation in some areas it has been on a quote consultation box after surveys with a limited range of options there 's no substitute for real engagement and prior input about different scenarios looking at partnerships yes that must still be national and regional partnerships but the front seat of the the tandem should be occupied by locals with a job of steering as well as pedaling and I 'm heartened by the recent announcement that Andre love it will cheer regenerate Christchurch and have a focus on the long-term planning picture and strategies all of which start with a vision a big picture more than five years on from the September quake it 's time to revisit the blueprint and some anchor projects in the light of what we know now in this regard Andre use of the term refresh not wholesale change at the very time of the original 100 a process the term blueprint an industrial descriptor for an organic process preempted healthy open public discussion on a range of scenarios and you could argue that since then as we look over focus of attention inside the frame on part and not the whole some interesting and timely private developments it also caused more than a few developers and challans to feel perhaps they 'd been framed and to think outside the box in ways which have created new nodes of growth not foreseen by the blueprint designers recovery speed and momentum may be important but direction is the key sometimes a space to develop an existing tactic into a new strategy and not work the other way around legislative provisions the continuation of some of the more draconian special post quakes provisions in the bill is highly questionable what may have been appropriate legislatively and the immediate aftermath of the quakes may well not be appropriate now by being embedded in the proposed new legislation these provisions weakens regenerated intense and may actually also affects the the locally leads rebuild some would argue that even having a minister for earthquake recovery is redundant at the stage of regeneration if the role is to say is to stay regeneration needs quite a different style of leadership then may have been appropriate in the post quakes response and recovery process the current bill is perhaps to reflect and enable a true sense of community capture the sense of promise and excitement creativity and innovation which the we will offers us if we do it right but a lot of the energy has been the fringe festival of recovery it 's been ignored by the major players and hasn 't been on center stage to quote Andre love it again I think the time is right I think that we look at what has been achieved now is the time for a different approach and a different drive forward and I would say he here too that the provisions of the bill before you need to reflect that different approach and give it substance and the charts to happen and involve the people of Christchurch thank you for the opportunity to speak for anyone 's information the 5th annual side up to the city events building the future now subtitle collaboration regeneration and innovation as on the 18th of March Thank You Lyle Mets got a question I 'll be interested in your view through your work with seismics in the city if i were to issue that gets raised about how much we 're advocating for future generations to come so I think of my daughter is two years old now what city she would like in 20 years time and with your experience in the work you 're doing how do we ensure we understand what a future city will look like you know this be clear those parts of Christchurch City that needed regeneration well before the earthquakes and ensure we put that in train rather than maybe trying to rebuild a city that 's been in the past and loss yeah well I think I think taking the longer view the city had a cardiac problem the hard work well before the quakes and it made a movement outs of a polycentric city which meant some of the early thinking we 're still looking at a post-industrial well where city the way it weird but if I with used to be important I 'll been to a debate last week with a Chamber of Commerce debating the young professionals about whether they had been kept out of the loop and the rebuild feel and one of our events affect last year we have some young people from schools and polytechnics working on the electric car they 're actually demonstrating a projects and the kinds of skills which will help build the future city it 'll be a great shame wouldn 't it to build new buildings somewhat great merit somewhat questionable mirrored but do the same old fence and so the real subjects is initiatives that we 're going on before the quakes equity some of ours and fears of an innovative city or the brain plane being the home of the Sanford clip of people and the chance to actually carry that forward and do things in different ways new ways of working new ways of living new ways of being and many of these things are outside legislative provisions and the changeable signs of progress like buildings capturing their energy and spirit of youth and other people is crucial I 've got the longest time to live with the legacy if we can build a city which is not a retirement village but continues to have great software and other surely you don 't think the new arrangements will create the step change needed to and drive business confidence and investment can you just expand on that briefly that probably came from my earlier comments on the on the pre bill developments but but in the end legislation by itself arrangements like a so-called once-off investment shop they say are very good in Wellington on someone 's desk but when you talk to entrepreneurs they are the ones who want to do things in their own way the other ones who decided to go to victoria street and lincoln in some cases many cases step outside the frame to avoid the bureaucratic octopus so to encourage that true step change you 've got to have a real partnership not just between government national local because after all locally you could argue the City Council you know is on the side of some of the negative feedback about under insurance it 's got to involve community groups education groups in especially in business groups in ways that you can 't contain inside legislation but you can encourage it if the legislation 's going to evolve a lot more important leadership than previous citizens groups which have been geared ritter 's loyal I 'm afraid we 're going to have to draw the hearing to a conclusion but thank you very much for your time think if your written submission and being with us today Sydney appreciated and I Eugenia presumably if you 've got a copy of your notes that will be useful well okay okay um

    "text": "welcome Calum you 've seen the process we 've got about 10 minutes some your submission was very brief members have read it over to you how we use the 10 minutes welcome all right thank you first of all I 'd like to thank the committee for giving me the opportunity to express my views about the bill won 't start by saying that Christ Church means a lot to me I was born here I was raised here I 've attended school here and I 'm now studying at University of Canterbury I mean if my family live here and I plan to work here after I graduate for me like many other reasons of the city I 'll be to burden boys be two versions of Christchurch first is the one that existed before 2011 which was raised and grew to love with which called architectural heritage vibrant public life a buzzing central city and strong community spirit the second is the Christchurch after the quakes a city of road cones hard hits memorials and urban desolation but also a city of solidarity and exciting potential I years on from the quakes the basic infrastructure will repair of Christchurch 's for the most part complete you 're not the city we once were this bill reflects idea that we can all agree on that the city is in a unique position with a new zealand of needing a strong focused and plain effort in order to restore its former health one of the stated purposes of the spill is to enable community participation and the planning of the regeneration of Greater Christchurch this is a noble goal but one that ultimately falls short of what is needed the main stakeholder then this process of healing is the parade patient itself the people of Christchurch she live and work here these are the people who will reap the benefits of good constructive decisions and bear the cost of bad ones people of the city are the ones but the vision for what it could be in how to get there we the people should be leading this process and not simply consulted for it we 're not just participants we are Christchurch as it currently stands the spill out of our hands and consigning us to decisions made by others who think I know what 's best for us the spirit and stated purpose of this bill acknowledged either the past or the future of the city there is no mention of the quakes and the purpose of the bill the reason we 're in this position in the first place there 's also no mention of where we are going which should be trained convector local government the emergency powers put in place after the earthquakes will authoritarian excluding many of the people of Christchurch from political participation in their own City this bill would continue many of these powers and changing them for another five years the influence guided to the crown through generate Christchurch and the specific powers granted to the minister or too wide like many others I 'm alarmed by the extraordinary powers gone into the minister for example the ability to unilaterally override the RMA as extensive given that it can be done and courting was in accordance with as few as one of the stated purposes of the bill the RMA important because of the special condition of our city in the event the RMA does pretend a barrier to healthy regeneration why is the minute minister given some unintelligible authority to decide how to act these extraordinary powers have needed at all should rest with locally elected representatives in authorities who are directly accountable to the people of Christchurch speaking from personal experience we 're fed up with having a future of our city dictated to us from reporting entities and officials who are not accountable to us this bill by growing a minister power to suspend amend or avoca council plans flies in the face of any notion of a locally leader generation a local government act provides pivotally adequate scope for next five years very generation I submitted the spill on discussion under discussion we both might be made to comply with EDX more fundamentally local control is important not just for the quality of war outcomes but for the socio political culture our city people will open the hole be more engaged with and personally invested in a city that they have helped to build there was then emerged alongside grassroots responses to the earthquakes such as get Phillip this is because get fella was something that came from the people of Christchurch people will be far more politically engaged and happier in a city that 's truly theirs there is risk of alienating people from the Christchurch if the central government blindly builds demolishes and landscapes without allowing people who live and work here true leadership of the Proteas a very significant sector of our society has been left out of consideration in the writing this bill this group of people currently has no say in either local or central government some of this group is simply not old enough to vote an arrestee get to be born assuming at the city last for more than a century the people of Christchurch sure alive today whether they 're setting in council chambers hauling play cards and the streets casting votes or doing no more than simply paying their rights and Texas represent a minority of the people who live in the city I 'd hope that this bill would can have considered the needs of future all 100 pages of this bill the word environment appears four times three out of the four times are in reference to the operating environment of various entities only once is a feeble not given to the importance of the future health of our rivers soil fauna format or ecology combined with the power granted to the minister by this bill to circumvent IMA and dispose of land of will this bill could pose an active threat to our environment I ecosystem is unique fragile and already under threat as we 've seen the papers recently the avon river is obscenely polluted this bill fails to provide adequate protection to our region 's natural environment and this is both backwards and irresponsible the way that we go about transforming our study into what it has the potential to be will matter for a scope of time that this bill seems to have ignored we were charged with protecting the environment for those who come who will come after us after us I still have much hope for this city and there are many things in this eight and there 's you must have bit it the regeneration process of the people when it should be led by the people thank you for listening to our submission callum thank you very much any quick questions members you Jenny could we have a copy of your presentation and thank you for a very thoughtful submission um why do you have so much confidence in the City Council providing a more democratic mode forward well because they are directly accountable to us the minister you know the minister who is the alliterative the minister is you know the whole of the country country in the people of Christchurch here vote directly for our representatives and it 's the sense in which we will be able to take control I think of the the process Thank You Clayton do you see much in practical terms between this piece of legislation and what we have now apart from more formalized representation and consultation but the minister effectively having the power of veto do you see much difference no not really no and things that concerns me as well as that what it 's it 's about consultation and feedback and things like that but you having a mechanism for that to affect change is really important as well which we need you know I think we can know if the minister still at the end of the day doesn 't really have any kind of I suppose isn 't really in any way forced to listen to what he 's being told by the community or you know those the regenerate Christchurch in the consultation is just a formality you involved in any of the sierra consultation processes I haven 't no come our time has expired thank you very much for taking time to be with us today and thanks for your submission if you could leave a copy of the notes with the clerk of the committee that would be useful for us okay

got about ten minutes you can assume that members have read the written submission that you 've made over to you how we use the ten minutes more of it you 've been talking to us the less we have to question you welcome thank you and thank you for the opportunity to speak on this very important piece of legislation for greater Christchurch 's future we submitted on the bill because we 're vitally interested in how the recovery of Greater Christchurch is progressing we acknowledge the end of the Sarah Act and the recovery work achieved under that legislation we are supportive of the general move toward locally lead to recovery and local leadership in this build an appreciative of the specific inclusion of New Brighton and the heart of eastern suburbs and the first regeneration plans we believe that after five years of direction by a crown agency namely can 't_''_65.67 be our locally elected bodies particularly to the Christchurch City Council in saying that we do recognize that due to the substantial investment the Crown has made to the rebuild of Greater Christchurch there will be need for some negotiations as to where that investment is spent we believe the relationship must be more collaborative with the locally elected council working in partnership with children and I tofu and Crown agencies the crown should not have the right of veto over projects the future shape of Christchurch must be driven by the people of Christchurch through their locally elected councillors as stated in our written submission we are concerned about certain provisions and language and less proposed act we remain concerned that this bill continues to override the usual Resource Management Act planning processes we also submit that it should also that it should be consistent with the purpose and principles of the local government act particularly with respect to the openness transparency and accountability required and the need to take the sustainable development approach as is the this bill is written currently we feel it gives too much power to transport land information and environment to suspend revoke RMA documents council plans regional land transport plans and plans or policies under the local government act well this may be done under public after public consultation and consultation with strategic partners we are concerned that such consultation will not be done the Tony manner and excludes a number of citizens and Biju as I said we do like lacking and due process or the team 's time scale which allows for for good and considered local input we are wary of the power given to the chief executives of relevant government departments to dispose of land to restrict two areas access to areas and buildings erect temporary buildings now to take works on private and public land particularly in regard to what may happen to the residential red zone land any powers under this new Act should be exercised only at the request and for the benefit of a local authorities and the communities they serve council should have the ability to ask relevant ministers to exercise powers on their behalf for example some aspect of a regeneration plan we understand disasters clearly demonstrate that locally lead transformative renewal ensures creative opportunities arise from disaster the people own their recovery this requires transparent democratic partnerships between central and local government and its equitable partnerships and including business and local communities our concern is that while section 3-c of the bill states a neighboring community participation the planning of the regeneration of Greater Christchurch community participation is not entrenched in the bill the bill must provide for a more inclusive framework of partnership and collaboration we request therefore the deletion of the provisions which establish a crown company promote and undertake anchor projects we 've not been impressed with the ability or transparency of the central city development unit and fear that the new crown company would just be as lacking and transparency and ability to facilitate the development of key projects how concern his groans it 's the release of the Treasury document which was widely critical of the ability of the crown to deliver on its proposed anchor projects at least two of these projects the convention center an elite sports stadium can be delayed for some considerable time in revitalized secondly that provision of coercive powers and enable unilateral central government intervention be removed from the wording of the set the wording of the actual line with existing legislation such as the local government act rather than using continue to use the extraordinary powers of the Sarah Act therefore full control the city should be returned to Christchurch City Council earlier than proposed in the bill we suggest by the scene between 2018 rather than 20 21 we do recognize that the crown is investing heavily in the recovery of Christchurch but the final sign up of projects that aim to benefit a city should lie with our elected councils rather than relevant ministers thirdly that full democratic process is restored with respect to ability to submit on regeneration plans this should be public hearings held in a timely manner so that we can have transparency about how the systems are being made finally and most important to us we know that there 's little or no reference to the natural environment in the bill and claws but three the bills five key focus for purposes focus on process reference to the regeneration already she loved the ecological integrity of our natural environment it does however provide for the ability of the chief executive of lens to dispose of land and residential red zone without requiring public input this is untenable where they remained strong public interest in the future this land particularly by those who once live via the ovin o-tar pero network has over time run a series of workshops in order to gather a wide range of citizen ideas of the residential red zone a number of these deserve to be support and implemented the aversion to promote the future use of photo photo Abram River and the surrounding red sign lands is an ecological and recreational reserved for the community is one to be applauded and should be recognized in this regeneration legislation this disaster has provided Christchurch with the unique chance to rethink our relationship with nature by building ecological resilience and regeneration into our city 's future we could create areas that would attract tourists my German friend who was visiting recently said that she 'd come back for a regenerator Dathan area economic regeneration we submit that Clause 3 should include a sixth purpose such as facilitating the establishment and management of Aylan attacker a river park for the enhancement of the ecological integrity of water quality biodiversity and for public recreational and cultural use land information New Zealand should also be instructed to make decisions about the avon river residential zone and consultation with the public of Christchurch they should aim to maximize the scientific educational and ecological outcomes with respect to the use of the land I 'm pretty much doing a summary the structure in place into the earthquakes has disempowered the citizens of Christchurch this is damaged community spirit had a negative impact on the mental health of the populace and been fundamentally undemocratic this top-down decision making has led to stalled white elephant projects in a city with little sign of progress beyond the basics infrastructure the meaningful recovery that has taken place in Christchurch so far and pretty much all its vitality has been led by individuals community groups and small business owners the central government controlled model has failed Christchurch we do not want to RMA documents council plans or other documents we do not want the entity that regenerates Christchurch to be jointly controlled by the crown and council we want decision-making power returned to Christchurch City Council with a process in place to acknowledge the strategic partnership role of NATO who we want democracy through our locally electric or interested representatives back and we want it now thank you for the opportunity to submit on this important piece of legislation thank you very much reviews almost all of the ten minutes but members have a number of questions so I 'm going to go to Paul the place on a new journey but they need to be very quick and quick answers please your submission were you here for sir mark Solomon 's presentation from night our who and taking on board your point about final decision-making powers would you agree with them that collaborative between the crown who 's investing billions the council and night are who is important i think no tahoe has a very important role to play in the future of the city they 've been waiting to have partnership with the city and and other local government agencies i fully applaud that it should be Clayton you have a an opinion on the level of power the minister hairs with Ali legislation I have a very clear opinion I think it 's way too high this we have a local democratically elected representative group here is the Christchurch City Council I believe that is what should we drive in the process where five years on the people need to take back this process thank you your journey doesn 't good morning Caroline good morning I 'm John you remember the community forum you want community partnership to be more entrenched in the bill what are the additional measures that you get under a council having our leadership rather than central government in terms of community participation I think you 've got the opportunity of bringing a number of people from a wide cross-section of Christchurch the community forum whilst there has a wide representation from across Christchurch it is there specifically to advise the minister is not it 's not a two-way process particular it 's not particularly very much taking time to prepare both a written submission end to spend time with us this morning thank you yes if may we have a copy of the notes that you were speaking from useful thank you and I like to call to the _"

    "text": "to call even heathcote Trust is a bad knee to the table please welcome cat okay we 've got about 15 minutes you can assume that members of rid your submission over to you how we use that time but the more of it you talk to us lists we have to talk to you so welcome and over to you thanks very much Kyoto I 'm Kip dewdney and I represent the open had good history a hoot I trust we for many years have been sort of a guardian organization for the s3 and its ecological well-being and we have got a number of projects with communities to help regenerate certain areas back into ecological fitness with wetlands reestablishment on the borders of the s3 and also we liaise with the questio city council and the environment council he can very strongly who actually support endeavours with funding each year we also have representations and with night ahoo and one of the things that we 're a bit concerned about the bill is that it 's a continuation of Wellington and central government involvement in the local communities Sara to be involved in that immediately after the earthquakes however we feel that central government roles should never solely to the actual local government acts which support the City Council and the local environment canterbury group we feel in particular to our ester eat trust board where we 're really concerned about the natural environment and the health of our history and our remit doesn 't really extend to the Avon and they have got rivers that feed it but we have real interests in trying to improve the water quality and everything 's that 's a huge issue as you may or may not be aware however one of the particular interests that we have with this bill is the land acquisition and redistribution amalgamation sale rights that it has on red residential red zone land the problem there being that our area which you can sort of see a little bit of a map behind David Parker on the wall is a sort of ste wide area and the red zone lands that we 're mostly concerned about which back up back on to the ester er new organization has these were particularly concerned about the sale of those lands and the redistribution of that because we feel as an organization on the trust that they should be allowed to regenerate back into a natural environment with possibly flooding mediation works but that 's about it we feel that the natural edge to the history is always a concern for us and that if it was to be sold to other interests it would be detrimental to the poor residents that have had to leave those areas so in a nutshell we think that the council and the local government he can Regional Council are a perfectly healthy and fit state to manage those under the current acts that are in place thanks for listening okay Uber 's questions you Jenny thanks for the submission in terms of the consultation process have you got any foreign land is sold and models for that or just call for submissions heather hearing and we 'd like in particular because of the and I guess you guys are fully aware of that devastating effects that communities and individuals have gone and it has a fundamental effect on your well-being and it fixed different people differently and I think that actually the people the community should be really deciding what they want to do to progress that tragedy and so submissions and hearings and things like that but ice a large voice should be heard from people affected thank you knock I really do like what you guys do actually down in history and the interesting thing too is the relationship that you have actually with with NATO just one part of it though is you know you 're obviously aware the Mahannah we management plan and then also the role of multiple potty in the new you know looking particularly the marking a chi exemplar and what that 's going on do you think though that you know with the new regenerate bill is the fact that with the representation of nato who will need to actually drive over that would actually assist I think that would be that would assist that I think that that nice house role in the community anyway is hugely valuable and could be driven there are some parts regenerate bill that we would endorse and that would be one of them but I just think it needs to be run by the community the larger community which is the reason why we aren 't sure we they 're here with when NATO who had their submission no well what they were talking about you know particularly having both the e we incur as a member but also as a man Athena were representative as well which would give it sort of more impetus wouldn 't know yeah so you actually get the e-way and then you get the local manuf in one particularly through the my Honda we plan management plan yeah okay good Todd look good morning thank you for your submission I 'm MMP from the Bay of Plenty so I 'm not from this area and but I found obviously the submissions interesting but you raised a theme which you know it comes up that will come up a few times during the course the afternoon and tomorrow around the extinct to which this bill is structured in a way that struggling with as I look at it is that I see you know reasonably significant opportunities from my eyes for people to be involved in giving their feedback on the proposed approaches with respect to regeneration hearing that here in the city and I wonder when you look at that why perhaps you don 't see that isn 't as a great Avenue for you and your committed team to be able to give voice to the issues that that you 're concerned I won 't actually answer that question to work I 'm also speaking on behalf of my father who 's next and he 's an urban designer architect so I 'll address those points and how the pitching because coming back in the next image all right so so bits unless there are any pressing huge questions about the Trust 's submission I 'm going to move now to the next submission which is ket again on behalf of Christopher Dowd knee but you 've clarified us now your father it 's good thank you very much yes it 's a it 's a bit awkward because much an ecological environmental sort of area and now I 'm unfortunately Chris my father is unable to be here today because he 's in Dunedin and he 's asked me to read his submission now he 's lives in red cliffs on the tree and he is an urban designer and a register registered architect and he considers that he 's qualified to comment on urban recovery issues now I 'm just gonna read his submission because it 's quite detailed and here we go I 'm going to go back into the first person now because he 's written this from the first person my concerns with the draft legislation are that it does not believe that I do not believe it can the content matches the stated goal that local leadership is the best form of post disaster recovery sorry said it 's not the submission that we have in front of us if you 're reading I 'm reading yeah I 'll start again chris is submission yeah the submission starts with my name is Christopher dewdney yeah and then the next paragraph is in introductory but we 've had we 've had the submission and and it 's light and it 's safe to assume that members of riddick oh good okay well if everyone 's perfectly happy about that I mean Chris feels as though that the the current that the syrah act which was in place for the post earthquake recovery system has failed on a number of counts and that 's laid out in the submission to be Risa stainable the long term it needs to be owned by the local lead communities and institutions which was a quote from Sarah and CC do used blue print and by the end of 2015 only three of the government 's 18 misconceive anchor projects have been finished and number have been cancelled and almost every project is delayed several ki aankh projects in particular convention center the rugby stadium and the elite sports center should be cancelled as they are distort the structure of the central city and they are unaffordable more than a billion dollars in total and they are non-essential the city rosie has a large 60,000 seat stadium close to at no cost to taxpayers and ratepayers instead of preparing much appreciated satina pool for eight million dollars Sarah is spending 27 million dollars on an overblown playground the previous Christchurch convention center which cost 20 million to build could easily be rebuilt in conjunction with the town hall and excellent location unfortunately sarah has destroyed our repairable Christchurch central library and instead settled us with a hundred million debt to enable a new one to be built the closure of gloucester street and the adjacent lanes by sierra for the proposed Convention Center is a serious blow to the city street network there are just a few of sarah cds views unbelievable blunders at the same time huge amounts of resource have been spent by siege to do and sarah with only marginal positive outcomes so I think Chris 's points are to change this are to actually have the the government the government less involved in the next five years he 's proposing that the government level of bureaucracy in seara has out actually led to some ill-fated experiments in anger projects where did anchor projects come from local government now has been a really good state to carry on the regeneration and he proposes some mechanisms for that to happen he suggests return the University to the city in the Eastern frame Lattimore square area there 's plenty of room relocation will be a return of 20 million 20,000 plus people tool in inner city the island campus could provide thousand new residential sections in an established suburb and green tech industry and there in the sound remaining campus buildings and the university is anticipating a spend of 1 billion dollars or two-thirds of the cost of total replacement in the next ten years anyway he also goes on to say Sarah could enable the utilization of the existing rail corridors for passenger transport and also rapidly move the city towards full electrification of all city transportation these are inevitable outcomes but the city rebuild could enable implementation in years instead of decades there are many more examples of innovative piles that could have been followed during the top-down phase the recovery but haven 't_''_773.6 been and with all this in mind he supports the general direction local governance and leadership and the focus on the regeneration CBD the residential red zone and New Brighton however I support or Chris supports a full withdrawal of the government from committees ministerial intervention and other mechanisms immediately christchurch is a mature and develop city with an educated and highly skilled population and many strong and capable leaders across business community NGOs political education and other areas it is time for local leadership to be supported and enabled by legislation thank you thanks cut now um are you going to ask your question again fashion designer who has you what during regeneration look like I 'm sure there are many hundreds others in the city who are equally passionate and have somewhere in different views I guess the question for me is twofold one is ultimately therefore there needs to be a framework that enables the leadership of the city in partnership with the crown to be able to drive their transformation forward and your view on that part you know the importance of retaining partnership as opposed to just being one partner or one of those two cartons and in the bill as outlined there is sufficient mechanisms for that passion of people like you to be able to have an input into the proposed regeneration plank sure well first of all I think that I did come into the end submission just before mine and I think a way around that will be returning the actual regenerate christchurch powers to to not at the moment there 's three ministerial appointments i believe and three council appointments with ministerial appointed chair or director and i think that that means that the ministry has overall say with regenerate christchurch so i think that that should be given to local to the city council entirely so the chair should be chosen from the city council or even ministerial involvement be taken away from the organization i think regenerate bill is as an organization is worthy and i think that there are mechanisms that can force through the ideals in the bill at a local level the main problem with it Todd is that you have levels of bureaucracy that get to introduce that almost stymies the regeneration and it becomes three we need to we need to focus back now that the Christchurch is getting back on its feet and I think we just need to the local residents who know that areas and work together already should have that power who an earth in their right mind would have thought that the council when they had share an idea and proposed regeneration of Christchurch they got the world 's most amazing urban designers the world has ever seen in to Christchurch for four days and they would have been employed like they 've been employed in Copenhagen in New York in Melbourne and in London we would have had Gail architecture the Danish firm designing our city with transport links involved in it with regeneration focuses guess what happened when the government took over we had totally different organization coming they did not hire the world 's best urban designers they hired local landscape architects to run a huge project like this and we 've got no sustainability built into the rebill we 've got no public transport built into the rebuild it 's not even facilities to actually buy the future because Christ Church will grow if it 's not under water Christchurch will grow and we will need those transport links but they 're not even featuring in the blueprint I mean it 's a disgrace paul foster bill subject I just what you see it as changed my training pool but now go back to what I was returned as I are you aware of some of the comparable overseas urban renewal regeneration redevelopment large-scale projects in particular thinking of Manchester which is an interesting example because you have there similar to the situation here yeah a labor leered council in manchester you have nine out of 11 councillors on the greater manchester authority being labour a Conservative government but they 've worked together really well to come up with a city deal they call it which peps is even of greater scope than what we 're working on here where you have health and education delivery as well as the Reeb you tification and redevelopment of the city yeah and don 't you see that some of those similarities between the two have been demonstrated and problem with our redevelopment is certainly not the pollute i don 't think it 's politics of the problem i think the government has tried its best they had step n sarah was a necessary evil i think it 's worked out we probably would recognize that it has not delivered and it 's been a bit of a failure but we had to go through that process because it was a huge disaster the problem is that with Manchester you had the world eminent urban designers involved unfortunately we 've been working through ccdu and they have not used Manchester 's designers they have not had the same process the other thing that 's strikingly alarmingly obvious is that Manchester was redevelopment on a stagnating or degenerating urban setting we have got an against all advice we 've pulled down the building 's we 've got a huge wasteland and we 've got the ability to put in amazing sustainable approaches to these new buildings none of which are in code and all the developers aren 't putting them in because they 're an extra two percent cost nothing there 's no great vision that we would have had with the Danish urban designers division that you 're seeing in Manchester what a great city redevelopment I mean something that we should be doing here and is severly nose diving into a problem although I think it 's fair to say similarities of the the EPS bill aside the context is pretty different they 're given it was the second city of the British Empire and many millions of people as you say stagnation rather than disaster so yeah yeah kept the time allocated to us for that hearing has completed thank you very much for taking time to be with us this morning and for both submissions on behalf of the trust and over on behalf of your father we appreciate it the ATO rematch welcome to the meeting Clayton Cosgrove it 's good to be in Canterbury with you good to be here _"

    "text": "Victor 19 and the Richard would like to come forward have you have you put through another set of wording what number are we 19 here we go okay so now the the recommendation that the originals put together for us to receive the information on the northern transport options report and initiate a business case process for a future public transport study with strategic partners and perhaps Richard a feud line to speak to that certainly and we did a brief into the IT committee on on future PT last week and I guess the point that we are trying to make air staff is that the first thing you need to do to go through a proper process for this as really something to kin to a business case now we 're already done some of that work a few years ago so it 's a matter of probably going back and revisiting there and it 's pretty fundamental to the success of the study or otherwise because if we don 't find the problem at the beginning things like this tend to start off wrong and go starting point and the second point that we were keen to emphasise as that I guess not to focus on one particular mode so there might be a number of rapid public transport options which are visible Christchurch but if you focus on one something light rail that may mean that others such as bus rapid transit are not considered appropriately so from our view we prefer a mode agnostic type study which will certainly include rail rail but doesn 't necessarily focus on it so we go through a process and it doesn 't focus on one the mode and we engage with our strategic partners as a part of that so the first step of that if that were to be approved by council would simply be holding a problem definition workshop to reconfirm that issue early in the new year and if the problem is still there then we 'd need some funding to do the study itself and that would need form part of the annual plan process this is part of this cheese repellents cheers for fun what will you clean loop you kicked him had a question too important together the format of the business case can I ask that staff communicate liaise with the community board so that we have an idea of what the terms of reference are I mean I know what a business cases but I 'm also aware that if we dilute this too much I appreciate your point about looking across all of the modes but the point at the moment is that it is rail and what we 've got there that we would like to be not the focus of but to have some weight if you like I just feel that if we dilute it too much across modes to do with rails that we don 't have any systems and place for at the moment that 's not really going to get us anywhere fast so I don 't know whether we can add something into that around a business case with terms of reference or speaking with the community board to establish those that would be helpful in conjunction with the community board thank you is that because they describe community boards because hasn 't come to Apple given the impact this is not the mines so to say has a huge effect on they will be done yeah well we 'll get to that we 're just trying to deal with our endo so can I just to make a comedy and ask a question because like a business casual future public transport study surely will be across the whole city and I want to just check on start to if in fact we start specifying that for example rail be specially noted what we not also have to include other potential forms of public transport for example that the bus record bus transport system and we might also include future technology and health uber will also potentially contribute to public transport I wanna clarify was really that effect is it is it not important to keep it broad so that in fact we cover the whole network and do it properly yeah that was certainly aren 't teaching that a VA a wider public transport record public transport study so public transport includes things like like rail will it be light transit transport so people people get all hopped up on this light round here it bro you can put light rail on heavy rail trails I mean there 's no reason why you can 't think of that you know I mean people have this assumption that that the tracks so what 's light it 's what travels on earth that 's life I pic with kiri rail they tell me we can use their tracks before light rail i think phil raises a good point there around the global aspect of transport because if we signal eyes then actually we need to sort out the northern arterial surely the southern artery which is equally as problematic should we look at as well at the same time well then you put it up we put ourselves this is to address huge problems the transportation is a city boy additional cut the staff prepared to that issue convicted around what other if we 're going to specify parts of public transport and what other parts to get this right should we start specify I think through you madam chair I think things need to be included was in it but certainly our thoughts were that it would need to be a wider study and our preference would be that we engage with our strategic a chance to do it think that 's good all right if we don 't engage with the NZTA from the beginning you certainly won 't be new funding and they 'd be pretty fundamental to it if you look at access to Christchurch City it comes from both climbing and Selwyn yeah that would be fundamental as well he can obviously run the PT services so we 've needs them in the room and if we don 't bring them and from the beginning you know the successor otherwise this piece of work is going to be seriously diminished right from the start and within dupper something which probably wouldn 't be worth too much need and we 'd spend a lot of money doing so our recommendation to you would be that we if you want us to look at future PT we do it comprehensively politically we do it Jason piece of work or but more than happy to include community boards and as part of that problem definition that weird like councillor clearwater attends the ones that in CTA 's have run and relation to the state highways we need to get elected representatives and their help them to find the problem because we don 't do that and again that undermines the process and the outcome that you might come up with ok this has come about because of the problems that we 're facing in our ward at the moment not only now but in the future and we in the ward to be frank have not seen any focus on anything outside of public transport and buses buses only so sorry for so what I 'm wondering is weaved elusiveness like it would like to suggest to you by stretching it across the city and making it into a large transport study how can we make this focused on alleviating the problems in the Shirley papanui ward related particularly to that northern entry to the city down cranford and what 's happening with the extensional cranford and further down because with respect to my colleagues that it 's been hijacked and if we need to bring strategic partners and great but how can we get the focus back on this one area which is why this was brought up and suggested in the first place undermining of the thinking around the arena and it 's without again wanted to jump to conclusions one would imagine as soon as you start defining what the problems are that would probably be one of the ones that pops out of the mix reasonably early on so the first step would be that sort of workshop and you look at well what are the issues that we 're facing we do know that there 's an issue to the north of Christchurch we do know that there 's constraints and rapid population growth at the margins are at the hinterland so that should pop out of the max reasonably early on in the process but it isn 't previously and that 's why I like a little bit of faith in there I think it has but we really haven 't done the sort about but the work hasn 't been done I mean there was a lot of work done there was a lot of work done up until I think that drafted the Christchurch central recovery plan was put together and there are a couple options for rail there but since that time we haven 't progressed that any further it has kind of been on our books but other stuff has got in the way so this piece of work really needs to be picked up again and brought forward into 2016 and beyond so not seeking to take away from the real issues which are up the effort but understanding the fact that they are genuine and they should pop out of the mix pretty early on once you define the problem so and if we get you know the input from community board chairs or community or you know ward councillors then then that should help define that again then we take it form from you what if you to say that if this business case did focus on northern transport options in an integrated way that that could will accept that we we are a city that sits on a north-south route you know and at least yeah but it 's mainly north south in terms of entry and exit or bypass you know and in terms of because you can 't ignore that 's why I think you can 't ignore the the state highways that run either way you can 't ignore them because they 're just like that absolutely connected and of course connecting with the with the wharf is another issue which is your your Eastern waimea Brown Street I can 't actually support that as it sits now I was supportive of that before when it was investigating the need for the rail options with a beauter you know alleviating some of those problems that we see as one of the tools in the box that hasn 't been addressed but I can 't support a future focus transport study which is far bigger and actually taking the focus away from where the problem was and where it came from in the first place yeah are we debating an alien I 'm kind suggestion madam chair that we talked about elected representatives being involved in this process and and that would include the community boards that the whole the whole network is interconnected certainly there 's pressures there 's pressures on the north we acknowledge that but but it is all very in canoe and we have to consider as a link to little tit and everything as well so I I would strongly suggest if we 're going to do this this work well we do need to consider the whole various small city in terms of you know in terms of scope of size butts the linkages coming into the city from the Selwyn 's and the way my career is that that are very important so no one 's taking away that this was the North idea but we do also need to look across the whole city right I agree that it we need to look at the whole of the city and when we 're talking about the long-term future you know 4050 years down the track we do need to get so that 's put in place that does need to be done and whether that 's through rail bus whatever it needs to be as long as it 's obviously separated from vehicles that people can get into town as quickly as possible the other thing we also need to do is look at more than a short medium term where we 've got a problem now and we 've got a solution that potentially state students around the phase which are the heavy rail tracks so I don 't disagree that we need to get all disputed partners together to obviously come to a along to envision but we also need to consider what we can do in the short to medium term to potentially relieve some of those pressures that are being created and with the heavy rail vets that 's an option I think it needs to be considered quite strongly when when you had the discussion about the long-term vision utilizing existing infrastructure as well yes I know but this was what the report was that came back to us that must be early on and after we were elected we 're to do so on a temporary guys respond Annette please leo look I understand that you know I mean the thing is is that I mean I 'd rather put the soft in too discussion to be held during the annual planning process because the cost of of even considering this option and doing it alone is massive you know to put trains on tracks solely for passengers to run from waimakariri and to the crush to enter christchurch city the cost of doing that and where do they whether they where did they drop passengers off no one yeah but they might drop them off up Mona Vale but there isn 't a station there no is that we need to look at that that 's only noticed fluo illnesses unless that 's the business case yeah I 'm sure that the people in that area who 've had that argument before will really welcome it but where do people go when they get off the train at Mirabelle or mona vale or at Eddington but you 've got to have a bus service that 's integrating the current the current system doesn 't exist you 're talking about a massive additional cost to our city that we would be alone and I mean I just think that we have to be responsible about how much that is likely to cost because the last thing that I want to do is to raise people 's expectations that this is something the city can afford to do all by itself we can 't and but but I know that there were some dollars a sense that were actually calculated in terms of the earlier report that was done and I know that the Shirley Papineau community board does not have confidence and that report but maybe what we 'll do is not make a decision today but ask you to go back and pull the earlier report take out some of the costings and actually bring back to us in the new year a model for developing a business case around the use of the existing track and and what that would involve so that we can actually make a decision as to whether we want to include that in think it 's a pity that councillors have been really busy lately and weren 't able to attend and board members to Michael 's here was good work whatever attend the rapid public transport workshop which we had the other day then I think there would be in a clearer understanding of how yes this rail part could well be and should be certainly very investigated as a significant part but it is madness to look at any one part of a system in isolation without considering the context and considering the other parts of it it 's just a no-brainer I think it 's actually unfortunate that we 're taking the line of sort of putting delay delaying the major part of us in the intra say if possibly looking at rail only the issue is far too important for them and that this business case isn 't if surely it would give us the direction that we need and it would include rail and it would include bus and it will include new new technology for example apps what you actually show people even wear car parking in that not to mention future opportunities for new technology yep around well uber is one example in here we get there so all these are important parts which I really want considered and there 's no question this is urgent and I think it 's really good the staff offered and brought forward the the workshop the other day and it 's unfortunate we haven 't_''_1087.17 got a better understanding but I think that by asking for this we will get a clear understanding and the other parts they are working to do and I 'm sure the community boards all of them can be fully involved I 'm just looking for a way in which we could structure of the resolution given their to ward councillors in wheelchair they 're pretty United on this rather than getting pushed into one or the other is there a way in which we can put something together too well we could why don 't we put three which is to provide advice on the provider provide advice on the on the utilization of the the current tracks I mean or infrastructure to stations as well and all and access to and those were the things we thought this report would probably address but it hasn 't there will be covered through Pegasus that I mean you can say that the solution is staring us in the face I know that we have looked at it before and I know that the costs are huge so it 's not just a straightforward yes we can just throw some trains that we don 't have onto a track that we don 't have access to and that 's a scene no I know but it sounds simple I 'm just saying that it 's not so we 'll just put provided by some utilization of the current infrastructure well no around because we want some advice on the usual ization of the current rail and Fritz trail and frustration thank you which which extends to the stations and given surrounded Yemen sorry I know I 've tied up at a time can I just say one thing I am really concerned though that you may go back to pull bits and pieces particularly around mean I 've heard and spoken to two or three people as you have as well with us to thank you for your time with that who have quite clearly said that those costs were hugely inflated and they have information and they have done research to be able to back that up can I ask if you do pull figures out of that and it 's a peer review of that report actually would be quite helpful but if you pull figures out of that can you revisit or perhaps even contact those people we 've been talking to to confirm that those are correct if there 's information available we 'll certainly great thank you we 're open-minded you can pair of your somebody else 's report but but I think that is reasonable to ask that the that that additional advice be obtained around around the collar yeah but if but if you if you come back to us on their shelves all right it 's good okay so I show now how do we get that moved and seconded pulling and Ellie all in an alley as opposed say no that 's carried we have _"

in terms of our specific interest we request that you ensure that the legislation recognize the ongoing treaty responsibilities this is even more important as we move to local leadership as the provisions of the local government act 2004 do not place the same obligations on councils that exists with the crown for example when regenerate cry toots moves to a council controlled organization to do no more NATO would like to ensure that it continues to have a strong governance representation the proposal to create regenerate Christchurch is supported we would like the number of representatives appointed two this would better reflect our interest and commitment to the regeneration process in addition we would like to be able to make these appointments using our own tribal

quite to do no more night of representatives would you see that one it would be from monofin one yes and the other one tribal Authority tribal Authority to know and think that that is that 's really pertinent as you nearly all tribes are we hoppin our structure today is that we under the Runanga process but as you know Harper was still alive the couple of this region is may do a houdini they are the tongue of the Phenom of they are the monofin or okay so to me just asking partnership with two do nemore NATO saw a monofin wat and then it continues on with that representation on this new approach with regenerate okay Kira paul foster belt Thank You mr. chair turn a quick tonight we call nautica who keep on a road to you via Georgia topple nothing out at the party couple pasta Bella home the other talkatora um so mark my question comes to advise that we 've had that the number of board members was designed to be an odd number to avoid the risk of stalemate it 's probably not night ah who 's predominant concern you obviously have you 're ruining his interest to advance but how would you foresee dealing with the potential risk of stalemate should an additional member be appointed to the board and would that involve perhaps a more conciliatory decision-making process rather than adversarial one-nighter who is well-versed in working with in collaborative approaches and collaborative processes we like them we believe that good you bring the community together you work on it together I don 't see it as a mission but i will say that if you 're not have have not been involved before but by the way to go from our perspective thank you David Parker cured over this something that it didn 't quite understand in your submission Tim point sets those submissions is that it 's noted them the transition plan a Christchurch Leadership Forum involving relevant ministers and the Christchurch mirren counselors will meet at least once a year to consider issues important to the city the proposal should in no way override the leadership provided by the strategic partners under the urban development strategy governance framework all members have an interest in the recovery regeneration of great Christchurch I I 'm not sure what 's meant by that is this is there some process under one of these and under either the bill or other processes that are already running that has a leadership forum that doesn 't involve some of the people who are entitled to participate in other parts of the process see what that means excuse me just read it please so we 're fully agreeable of the process of the Canterbury leadership coming back to the government on a yearly basis we don 't want there to override the collective approach within this process that 's basically saying don 't come over with a heavy and start dictating from behind right okay thanks okay cuter taught to see you again in your opening comments you understandably put a lot of emphasis around the additional representation on the regeneration board as an example of ongoing treaty partnership is there any other area that you 'd like to highlight I mean your report pretty comprehensive but in addition to that extra seat where is the other examples that you would like to highlight for us of night ah who being and partnership with the city of other city leaders in terms of regeneration christchurch from your perspective we have that arrangement of now it 's under way we 're working together as a collective so the three mears the charity can myself so we have that at that process but unless that 's been forced in the legislation in many ways it 's acquaintance because if there 's a change of counsel or if they 're a one so we would like the treaty part in the bill will always fight for full treaty clause but also we wanted and shrine done the legislation that we are part of the path the leadership processes of this regeneration of the city not just to have it noted where we can be removed at the worm if there 's an election okay thank you there appear to be no other questions from members so so mark can I once again thank you for your leadership and involvement in this process today we 're looking forward to working with you and the EE as we go through congratulations on being the first submission of the day thank you gotta cope though you know now like to call to the table the emir of christchurch city who worship and members of her team to make the Christchurch City Council submission please your worship welcome once again this is the second time that we 've been hosted by you and your counsel in this fine chamber thank you again for that hospitality and the hospitality be extended to the committee we 're a few minutes extra in terms of a presentation time we 've got about 25 minutes over to you how we use that but we 're looking forward to hearing council submission you can assume that members have read the written material from council well ochio tokoto couture and welcome back the greater christchurch regeneration bill represents the most significant opportunity we have been offered as a city since the canterbury earthquake sequence began just over five years ago people have been using words like stick change and transformation and that 's what this bill represents to us it 's actually quite hard to believe that I 'm sitting here at this end at the table as mere of Christchurch just over four and a half years ago I sect where you 're sitting and I listened to submitters which included all of the strategic partners that are described in the bill there is a world of difference between then and now for a start today you have the mayor and the chief executive sitting side by side with the backing of the council representing elected members and the organization but there were four councillors who turned up because they hadn 't had a chance to be involved in the process of developing the submission and responding such was the truncated process one day of hearings but no prior notification and no time for any discussion tomorrow you 'll hear from one of those four councillors who 'll make a submission as an individual that 's local democracy but as a mere who set where you said and who has been a cabinet minister for over seven years I can tell you that it has been an absolute privilege to work with a government a minister and probably more importantly a prime minister who are committed to the city 's regeneration and are willing to try something bold and this is bold we 're making history with this legislation and you 're part of it a joint agency to take on the next stage of our journey hand in hand shoulder to shoulder the fact that it was the prime minister who came to Christchurch to make this announcement has set the tone for an engagement that represents a sea potential for a real legacy and each one of you can be part of making that history we haven 't had anything like this ever before in New Zealand the confidence that the Prime Minister has expressed in US has been gratifying and we will not let him down and we won 't let our city down my mantra since running under pendant Lee for the mural t has been what 's best for Christchurch not what 's best for council what 's best for the government what 's best for Sarah what 's best for CC do you but what 's best for Christchurch and I 've had my mind focused on relationships building relationships why my career Ian Selwyn District Council 's he came nigh Tahu the ministers that we engage with as a city there was more repair work to do in this city than broken pipes and broken road but it hasn 't been easy but i have to say that in response else that he deserves a legacy and this bill offers us more than a statutory agency called regenerate christchurch it offers our whole i 'm going to hand over to the chief executive he 'll provide a quick synopsis of why the crown now can have confidence and the council and then I 'll come back and just touch on one particular aspect of the submission that I would really like to emphasize today ok dr. Edwards thank you so in October 2013 the city had a brand new council coming to office and I joined the council about eight months later we have a very different organization today than we had back then and so just on touch on some of those things we 've addressed our financial issues we fully understand our financial situation and councils have made prudent financial decisions including redeploying our resources for example recently counts was announced the sale of one of our trading organisation city care to realize the capital and to reinvest it in our city we 've driven efficiencies across and throughout our organization and we will say forty million dollars in operating costs over the next three years and we have the confidence of some of our keys take a financial stake holders week Standard Poor 's improved our credit rating and outlook because of the decisions made by counsel we 've also restructured our organization to better respond to a regeneration phase we have clear lines of accountability we 've streamlined and joined up planning and delivery and we 're a can-do organization we 've totally changed the way that we operate and we 've shifted the culture of the organisation to being citizen and community focused to being service orientated open and transparent and we make decisions based on what 's best to the people of Christchurch we 're passionate about our local communities determining their own destiny and are committed to real engagement public participation we 're also both a city in an organization on the move for example we regained accreditation for building consents and now arguably lead New Zealand and these services we have star seconded to mb to partner on designing guidelines and standards as an example we have a one-stop shop for all consenting and licensing and much more joined up approach to all applicants we 've reopened many community facilities over the year and including just last week the first flight flow by China Southern under Christchurch next week will open up new visitors for Christ 's Church in new frontiers for Christchurch people the tender on a central library closed two days ago and will be awarded in the new year our first our world-class art gallery reopens next week and the Town Hall repairs are well underway and yesterday at a council meeting are we released five announcements on major decisions such as our Eastern Sport and Recreation Center we 're a city on the move and everywhere you look outside things are happening in our organization is already leading the city through those changes so we 're ready to leave the city through the next phase of our history we 've also formed strong relationships and productive relationships with central agencies and a staff have been working really closely with Sarah on the regenerate Christchurch and we 're aligned on many many things so what I 'd like to formally ask because there are officials continue to work together with your officials and your advisers on finalizing the technical details or regenerate outcomes for our city so we 're ready and willing I just wanted to end with just a common comment on on what we think could actually resolve things in it reading the submission you could be forgiven for thinking that perhaps we weren 't that keen on on elements of the bill but as we see we think that the fault lies worth using an amendment process to the existing legislation which was designed on it agency under extreme pressure and I think that 's where the fundamental flaws arrive from but there is an easy Faxon so we 've come up with a solution and if you if you actually look at an appendix and our submission web actually we actually drew a picture of the of the process of designing a regeneration plan and when we when we produce that we immediately showed what the floors were because you could have basically the minister proposing a regeneration plan deciding whether there should be one and then finally signing off on one so I mean in fact there was a considerable risk to the minister in terms of think it was anyone 's fault it just didn 't have the benefit of sufficient time to work things through and so what we have done is we 've developed an alternative process and an alternative chart and this might look challenging in terms of the number of boxes there but actually what it does is that puts regenerate Christchurch up front and center it strengthens its role makes it crystal clear that in the areas we it operates within the four evah news within the residential red zone and with a new brighton and indeed any other area that is subsequently added by way of order and council regenerate christchurch leads the way and i think that this is such a fundamentally different approach that this is what would leave a wonderful legacy i believe that the crown and the council 's objectives meet with the structure and a lot of the detail that we put which was kind of a just in case this just in case this what if they decide this what if they decide they 're in part be a lot of that simply falls come back with a supplementary submission that actually resolves all of those issues the week of the eleventh of january if there was an ability to go down this track because i think this solves all of our problems we think that the policy intent of this bill as widely supported by both the crown and the council the key challenge is now to get the bill to accurately reflect the policy intent we think we 've got a an idea around strengthening the regenerate Christchurch mandate so that its leadership role as properly reflected in the legislation and more importantly the Christchurch community can have confidence that we 're on our way so it 's about building momentum but it 's also about retaining confidence and both of those things can be achieved with some small changes to the bill your worship God rivets thank you now members are there questions and just before we take questions some I don 't think for a minute that there would be any objection from around the committee table to adopt paragraph 17 point 15 of your submission which asks for permission close I thought I can 't imagine there would be an objection as the members know so we 're happy to do happy to do that instantly now are there questions members David yes I just comparing that the two structures and and I probably should have my here hit around this better than I already do but a as as the the essential change that regenerate Christchurch is the which includes representatives from of the crown as the body that decides whether the proposals that have come forward for a regeneration plan from proponents they do the work as to whether that should whether that plan preparation should continue make a recommendation to the minister and the minister adopt saw declines the recommendation rather than the minister making the decision as to whether the regeneration plan is doing that an electrical work if you like I mean the regenerate Christchurch has two functions and once we actually got our head around the two functions and split them and down the middle you can see that it has already has the statutory mandate to develop regeneration plans for the central absolutely no reason for the minister to be engaged in that front end of the process view but when it comes over the other side of the table it has a reviewing and an assessing and analyzing process against agreed criteria and the purposes of the act and and also to take into account the views of strategic partners and so when when you come down the left-hand side you can see that the minister is advised of the proposal we 've got only a six ministerial approval it probably is more in the way of advice as to whether there is a belief that the threshold has been left but meet because in those in the on the right hand side central city residential roads are new brighton the statutory decision has already been made that areas where regeneration plans need to proceed and the other areas there may be a proposal come up and you know you can think of many areas we 've got suburban master plans for example and Sydnor there 's there 's a lot of interest and and whether signum needs something a little the line the woolston area is a another example where you 've got a combination of residential you 've got new developments you 've got old industrial as well and how do you how do you look to the regeneration opportunities there does it need a statutory plane and it may not it may be that the regeneration occurs naturally or that it occurs because there could be a statutory plan put in place you may not need to go that far so regenerate christchurch plays a pivotal role on the right hand side of the line is the leader it decides who develops the plan who leads the engagement process it decides the nature of the engagement process and some instances that will have to be more formal than another 's so I think that what we 've come up with here as a model that that gives us an opportunity to get a new way of doing regeneration planning or urban development and new zealand it has got that potential yes Todd 's gotta suck an engine what further in your previous answer you said that you don in the draft proposal and I just I just I 'm clearly looking at the the current framework as distinct from your blue box option yep you 're quite right the minister is involved arguably that 's a sort of key steps on the journey including at the front end where plans are being initial ideas are being crystallized so you don 't think that 's that 's a good idea no well it 's not necessary well the idea is that regenerate Christchurch is the statutory body that provides that leadership in terms of you know whether a plan as necessary or not but there is a chicken point with the minister when the proposal has come from us if the proposal has come from night aho if it 's come from he can or indeed from the minister him or herself so and and in that regard there is a need to seek the views of the Christchurch City Council because we 're talking about two different areas and actually you 've reminded me of something that perhaps isn 't clear when you look at the bill the difference between christchurch city boundaries and the rest of Greater christchurch and and i think that probably was missing from the previous submission as well as their regenerate christchurch is only for the crisis only for christchurch city so why my career ii the district council and Selwyn district council do not use to regenerate christchurch know so so sorry doc I was I had actually called you journey but I come back money but we would um in terms of the submission you are proposal the council 's proposing quite different purposes and which make it quite clear that the Crown 's ongoing role and will reduce and require local participation of being essential where is the bills only about enabling and get rid of things like enabling a focus in expedited regeneration process is that examples of what you were saying that the bill at the moment continues too much of that but the sierra legislation we would want to review the the Part B of our submission and light off of further further work being done on this model because a lot of what we put in they excluded the Christchurch City Council or just treated the city is somehow a stakeholder or a you know a status that was less than a joint partner I mean oh we use the word strategic partner but we don 't actually necessarily mean the partnership model that regenerate Christchurch represents and so because the the way the bill was drafted was based on the old Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Act it actually failed to accept that in the christchurch city boundaries and the the relationship is different and regenerate christchurch I mean the announcement of Andre Lovett as the chair i have not had anything but absolute praise for the quality of that decision and it was a joint decision you know i just think that we 're honor we 're on a roll here we 've got a real opportunity to make something really different and i don 't really want to hook unto the wording of our original submission which was an all basis submission just in case though we are hearing a lot of other missions later on which are calling for some other things as the greater emphasis on local participation and decision making so yes and we do see local participation and decision-making as being generated by regenerate Christchurch we really do it 's a local organization jointly appointed and I know that people would like to see to transfer you know to the council perhaps more quickly than as catered for in the bill if we get this model right I believe that it can come to local ownership much more quickly than the bill allows but if we also get it right then I think in the future we will see this as the model that could be leading the recovery right from the outset in the post disaster environment so are the purposes in the legislation quite critical to that because all of the powers are exercised under the purpose so getting this right and what you put on your original solution seems to be the framework for the entity that you 've described and how offering yeah that is true but I 'd rather do some more work on there in terms of a supplementary submission but it 's one of of this this was just released this week resilient New Zealand has been a combination of becker bnz iag New Zealand Red Cross and Vodafone and what they 've done is they 've done an analysis of the role of business and recovery and and they actually described a model of of engaging right from the outset as a joint relationship between the crown and the local authority this regenerate Christchurch could be a model for how we do recovery in the future rather than putting a government department in the middle of a city in a post disaster environment you know and hep D politicizing the entire process by having a a board that 's jointly appointed and maybe over a period of time transitioning the government out of that role an actual fact you wouldn 't be here during a second bill if we 'd started from the point of a joint approach that transitioned down to a across to local local government control thank you you are not look to me this is a like alternative plan is about collaboration more collaboration good to heat up my it so it has it been have you gone out and sort of tested it with any of the other sort of partners that you 're featuring in here like Michael who have the issue is is that and again this is about regenerator christchurch and regenerate christchurch only involves the Christchurch City Council 's area and in terms of the inclusion of night ah who on the board that was something that the minister raised with us and we agreed that that should happen so in the original proposal it was just the Christchurch City Council on the crown that appointed to the board and we had a you know the minister would appoint for the first period and then we would appoint for the next we agreed right from the outset that we would jointly appoint the chair and then we would have the chairs of development Christchurch limited the chair of crown co and then our other appointments and then night ah who was added as one of the crown appointments and I mean we were absolutely comfortable with that that 's what created the the number is that you 've just got to you think of that triumvirate I call it the triumvirate of regenerate Christchurch over the top this is in Christchurch City and then you 've got crown co focused on the delivery of anchored projects that the crown are leading and you 've got development christchurch front face investment opportunities for the city i know i just think it 's a great model I really do met just picking up specifically the the recommendation about excluding hagley park what was your thoughts about their from your concerns I suppose well we there is no reason for it to be included in the CBD I mean we all think of the forever news when we think of the CBD in terms of regeneration plans I wouldn 't want to send a message that we were going to do anything and in higley park I mean you 'd like to take it on with you I mean yeah Ron Guthrie did many years ago the there was an anchor project that was included in it and that was the Hagley oval which is now up included anymore Joe my question is around and I 'm not sure be my answer but I 'm your submission you talk about the long period of regeneration for Christ you 're looking out to the future do you have an idea of how long the future is going to take in as part of it that part of the future as you know we you would see our Asia seed where the government would slowly back away yeah I think that I think that it 's almost impossible to put a period of time on it but if we get this model bright then it isn 't just a post disaster regeneration model it 's actually an urban development for urban decay model as well and there are cities throughout the United States that have had periods of decay I met the mayor of Pittsburgh a while back and he stood up and he said the minim the city of Pittsburgh died in nineteen seventy it 's now the most exciting and vibrant and wonderful place to be so how do you get a city that has you know urban decay how do you regenerate in that environment and and we do have a planning environment which can be enormously challenging to you know to actually bringing about the sorts of changes that you want to achieve in a relatively short period of time and I I always use the example of the something called plan change 48 which was introducing flood management areas and Christchurch the process began in 2005 the plan change was due to become operational and September 2010 you know five years to bring in flood management areas which were floor levels to actually protect homes against being flooded it 's just you know sometimes you actually need to think can we do this better and that 's why I say this is a regeneration model quite different from a recovery model but if we started at the beginning the recovery with a joint a joint government counsel approach right from the get-go then we would be moving into regeneration as a natural flow from where we were yeah yeah it 's a I think most people around the table here would agree that it interesting example that you gave in respect of the you know the obvious need to have an appropriate rule to stop flooding of new houses particularly when they 're built would you be able to provide us with a new your staff with an analysis as to why that took five years yeah I mean was that was that and you know was that unnecessary it was a mixture but it was it wasn 't it wasn 't it I always thought that it was multiple appeals and things like that and people not wanting it it was that you needed in-depth analysis I mean it 's interesting the parliamentary commission of the environment has just put out a report on coastal hazards and she 's talked about the need to work empathetically with communities and we we ended up we can 't fast track coastal hazards you can 't because you do need to work carefully with communities empathetically because there are issues and challenges so we 've pulled that out of a fast track process so there are things that are not appropriate dealt with in a fast like to see we 're the excess of time was and we ask what you think would be an appropriate range of times because it seems to me that one of the things that we risk doing here is that we risk giving the council all of the time that it needs and occasionally councils do make mistakes and if we allow them all of the time and make the rather brave suggestion that collaborative processes always get to the right outcome we actually are left wanting to save time by truncating appeal rights and I 'm not follow that 's right I 'm uncomfortable with that idea because I have seen some plans on my lifetime under the RMA that have been terrible and I 've been fixed by the Environment Court the appeal Authority and so I 'd be quite like to send you see your viewers to wear how we how we can take out unnecessary steps or have read written you know decent time frames getting to an end point within the time period that 's needed without truncating those safeguards that come from appeal rights can certainly provide that information but I think of New Brighton because you know i I 've represented the area as a member of parliament when I first got elected as the MP for Christchurch East I there was a revitalization plan you know and then there was another one and then there was another one and they 've been one before you know like you actually need at some point to have some sort of process whereby you can address these needs now in terms of New Brighton it 's just screaming out for a regeneration plan that has some teeth just you can put all of the plans together but if you haven 't got a mechanism for delivery then it just won 't happen and that 's to me as the biggest reason why you know I can but but yes I mind if I do take your point on regenerate got on the need to have some instruments that allow revitalization of areas that are in decline whether it 's whatever the causes of the population decline unless there is some if it seems to be _''_2468.71 recently boldness we lost over six thousand households that have probably would have associated themselves with new brighton as their local center I mean no not for all of their shopping needs or anything like that people tend to go to malls but you know that 's had a huge impact on the area and what that number of people you do need to think a little bit more boldly about what can be done and this is what offers that opportunity you worship dr. Edwards we 've run out of time but can I on behalf of the committee thank you both and council for your very good submission and for your collaborative good will approach to us I 'm sure that we will be able to produce a very workable and useful piece of history in this legislation it 's always helpful for the committee if we could maybe have a copy of the introductory remarks that you were both referring to it 's just helpful for us yep okay cumberly will be able to sort that out so once again thank you very much thank you _"

we just do succeeds to and just to prove the minutes first so Phil moves seconded term I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye what we just get clarification over the Riki Lindhome no no these are the minutes we 're just approving the minutes minds you can talk to them offline that they 've got a I 've got delegated authority to make a decision there are no parte decisions and the report and I 'm just going to be ruthless and there we go so I 've got yes so i 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye as opposed say no that 's carried and so that 's the minutes now we move to 63 which are the decisions around the AAC phase two projects and s of streets Phil do you want to introduce this well certainly and has come it 's coming from you remember she ran idea people wanted accessible City which allowed greater priority for active active transport for people be able to walk and cycle and for public transport in for slowing traffic down in places so hot since with this phase and the staff can discuss the specifics and we 've already had the children Street cycleway going and it 's been approved and is underway and now we have the suggested Street phase so a key part of that is the cycle way and it 'll be a separated cycle way and yes there as there was a lot of consultation done on this the some this part of an accessible City and overall and it 's yeah in my view it 's quite clear that what the people wanted initial to have to change the mode of transport the vet should follow and those speak to refer to very clearly in the report righty-ho and would someone like to move it I 'll be back Phil seconded by pauline there any questions Danny I just want to be clear authorities or program yeah so look I think that 's a mistake yani there was a mistake it 's a mistake ok so the committee doesn 't have delegated no and out we asked for it obviously to come to counsel that 's good can I just check on the just the financials how much is it costing and how much it ends at en serio contributed the budget is three and a half million through the L through the LTP we 're confident we 'll deliver it for that much and the contribution from the NZTA I couldn 't comment on it except that we have the conversations around ncts Kashia are on gong so we have no I can 't comment at this stage like all things that say it this it 's a subsidy places in that you do the work and you make a claim stove I would have to get bacterias to what the eligibility of that what the percentage subsidy is called race considerable concerns around the Potters project is from the loss of parking cycleway going past a lot of bars and its but the relevance right now where we 've got let 's just take care of the street for exams they can without the AC a whole lot of arias is going to have babies we 're going to dig it up so it with my next year lining our AAC projects with development so to me would seem more important to actually a line that we 're doing with currently what 's being developed it 's an SS treats you know it 's it 's working at the moment but we 're going to have the triangle center building that 's the the yang said building we 're going to have the hunk building finished on on casual street and walking around those streets that you know that they really need fixing first and live you so I just wonder has it been given to aligning our AAC projects with development so that 's that 's really the quickest way here aside from the other concerns of loss of parking dammit street in that considerable concerns from the businesses so that the priority for the San s of Street project goes back to the LTP the logic at the time that those decisions were made was to do with completing what we 've committed to and in the particular instance of senescence street what the priority is it 's about matching the facility that 's already been embarked on on Chum Street separately it is the coming financial year we are embarking on a particularly ambitious resurfacing program to address some of those issues council long style has pointed out around just the general state of the pavements and this particularly in the CBD did anyone else have any questions Jimmy further the option is the inconsistent with the council plan in a policy I just want to know you 're being consistent with the stre space that is anti now because this in those by April this year so far as the mitigate his effect so that particular inconsistency is that the streets and spaces guideline that was endorsed by council actually would have taken out the car parking in its entirety on the southern side of the nests of street and under that particular cross section the loss footpath 25 metres at the outset of our scheming for this project we decided that the retention of the parking was of greater significance than whatever footpath and that explains that protection with section of the report thank you right okay any discussion yawning yeah thank you i won 't i won 't be supporting just this project effectively my concern is concerns of several but one in terms of priority of spending given the financial issues that we face and particularly with the most recent announcement around the infrastructure i am concerned that we do need to look at the big picture and regards to fixing the broken infrastructure the head of effectively gold fighting the central city I think the need for the cycle lane is largely driven by the the u-turn on the cycleway going through the South frame which was supposed to be the cycling and pedestrian link from east to west and I have real concern about placing too many things on streets in terms of activities where you 've got car parking hospitality heavy vehicles cycling walking so I just have concerns that we the site dedicated corridors like the South frame was supposed to be for cycling and pedestrian activity which I think actually leads to a much safer and healthier outcome in terms of what we 're doing so I appreciate that you 're trying to deliver modal shift in the central city and I totally support encouraging more people to cycle and to walk but I don 't think that this is the right approach I think there is going to be I think one of the really other things that 's missing is really a holistic approach to traffic and we just have spent a lot of time talking about the northern arterial extensions and the impact that that 's going to have but actually that 's gonna put a huge amount of traffic into the central city and we still seem not to have a kind of overall strategic response to how we 're connecting the suburbs into the central city which concerns me particular if you think about the intersection here we 've got high streets and SF fury road Madras and potentially a huge stadium going just that this isn 't shouldn 't be a priority there 's greater pressing priorities in terms of fix some of our broken infrastructure and the suburbs take on board the point that was made by counsel monster which I 've made previously on these accessible transport projects that in fact putting an huge expensive projects when you 've still got demolitions and construction to occur there 's premature because you actually end up having to spend money again to go back and fix with a damaged because so I think personally this isn 't a priority for us as a city i think is present more pressing priorities elsewhere and i 'm concerned about the impact that this will have in terms of the bitter amenity outcomes when in fact we should have been seeing this through the cell phone so i won 't be supporting it and pulling you think 's look look is phil seed sheeran idea people are passionate about cycling is only one way to get the cycles out there next to make it safe and it will be a slow zonings that unit in itself with other forms of transport the through the consultation i noted that the staff did make it a lot of changes to the submissions to address the issues i like the idea of the trip it 's going a little help both the quality in the quantity of the stormwater they made some changes at high street at fury road out of the parking that was going to be root removed in a ver taining 123 out of 208 so i think we 're doing the best we can it is really difficult retrofitting things like listen to existing streets it 's perhaps never going to be perfect but i think we have to support the cycleways this is the best city for cycling let 's make it the best city in new zealand if not the southern hemisphere for cycling so let 's get cracking I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye aye those opposed say no jaani in Paul lonsdale thank you do you go to stare his staff a huge amount of work on this 290 recommendations all gone through very clearly in you very very much thank you you 're welcome anything by the dog we do appreciate my dimples hey we 're almost there team almost there item 45 _"

document watch later is the it 's in seed 72 no it 's not an see it 's a it 's a date-date sandy right page 13 okay so um that 's moved by refs seconded by terms is there any discussion about that Yanni just a lot of what we heard previously around the need for consultation given that this is suggesting that we agree that the council only nymphadora street and surrounding council insights and order to seek development partners it 's a feeling wide-ranging thing I think there 's even mention of the crown father site no in here now you 're Jason crowne plaza site is one of us example so I just wondered whether we actually need to consult on this given this as effectively taking away public land and putting it into a private process and I don 't believe that 's me Mulder quickly 49th off a statement of intent actually go ahead and engage with the market around these sites yeah but it 's not the crowne plaza side it is it 's been brought in so if you read the report there 's actually been important but it says specifically 925 kilmore street and 82 and 84 peterborough street and surrounding council own site and then it goes in the course of the report and gives us is the problem of getting the late supplementary but it goes on to talk about sites like the crowne plaza site yes of the side hey it 's talking about the influence of the site that obviously you have to take that into account through any master plan development it 's funny might happen to that site that they 're not actually looking at this site specifically night it 's not included yani okay it 's just not good no well it says the beard says that during the course of the macro level master planning exercise for peterborough quarter dcl was also likely to identify other sites that will help catalyze best outcomes for the peterborough quarter development in the that is likely to have some influence on the regeneration of the peterborough quarter that is true but we 're not asking them to make any decisions or recommendations around the camp laser sight of the stage it could actually mean that actually a massive effect you could be the reverse a good outcome on the pit of our quarter could actually influence the value of the crowne plaza site so it 's sort of a yeah but that you know that it is a special site the crown part of Plaza site because it connects the victorious court square a victoria street with victoria square it 's the entrance it 's the grand entrance to the city so it 's you know I mean the crowne plaza ruined the entrance to our city hate to say but in a way that you know that the potential for that site is significantly you can 't ignore that its influence that it will influence and be influenced by what happens in the peterborough quarter but I think that this is this is a great thing to be happening and and the public tendering process around the Convention Center site so that has taken us into the space where we can move forward alright so if that 's the case then can we delete the woods surrounding councillor own sites give them that you said that that 's not included under the option on recommendation one here we specifically want them to I mean I 'm reluctant to take it out because it just they can 't do anything with it they can 't you know and if they did come back with a recommendation around around that site if they did we would have to go out for consultation on it there 's no question about that there 's no because it is because of the significance of the site okay so I just I mean I i just had concerns that this is further removing you know it 's changing the process for which we have learned disposal on transfer and it 's so broad and given the concerns we 've heard it around you know the need to consult on things that are significant so that 's that 's view the other question I had was have we done any strategic work around as a city council as an organization what land holdings we wish to retain in the central city well what can be done as part of us because I am worried that if when disposing of land that we have shifted strategic need for ourselves actually we 're it 's like sometimes like the car parking we 're playing private developers for private landowners more money than the cost of us that we 're charging to the public so we 're actually losing a lot of money I can 't agree ya know but look we 've asked the we 've asked the chief executive to come back with detail around our land holdings but to separate them into different categories so that and clearly this is associated with the regenerate christchurch coming on stream so all of the excess land and the CBD so all of our land holdings and the CBD that we don 't necessarily see as or might be available for regeneration purposes all of the land associated with continuous to near land holdings that we might have in the master plan area so new brighton and all of the suburban master plans because again if you can see if you start to look at land holdings through a regeneration lens then you start to see a world of possibility that we haven 't been looking through before so I 'm I 'm quite comfortable with them with where we 're going with this yes there will be land that will want to hold on to and yes there will be new parks and new reserves and new opportunities all through that residential red zone as well so I 'm not too worried about about that I just want to make sure that we get the regeneration opportunities around all the suburban centers as well as the cvd alright so i will put that motion all those in favor say aye all those opposed say no it 's just yonni yeah no thank you um _"

    "text": "okay well at least as carry-on and we 'll go back and backfill in a minute postal services and Pendleton y Mari community just one of the one of the wordings that I 'd like to see changed here as endorse the proposed new zealand place into integration under the Pendleton service center and alignment with the citizen hub strategy with as much of the with as much of the services with as many of the services previously provided by New Zealand Post and it as possible because I was in a shop and the phenyl term all on the weekend and unfortunately New Zealand posts have already closed their service there is no notice on the window saying it 's going to be available to service is going to be available at the Pendleton see the center and februari because there wasn 't there wasn 't an alignment between this decision and their decision to close the rent on the shop that they had does not expire to January so the people that are going to move into that shop can 't move into it because the there is people elderly people have been coming into the shop i was on on a daily basis saying whereas whereas the post where 's New Zealand Post gone and why is my shop not there and the reason that and so I 've sort of undertaken to let them know you know that let them know already that that this decision was going to be made today but what I discovered was that it 's some not not intended to include all of the bill paying facilities and and actually these people need bill paying facilities more than anything else these are not people go online with internet banking these are not people who find it easy to go to places and and then to hear that the post the post up box itself won 't even be located there we 've got to find a better way so I kind of want to encourage staff to work with New Zealand Post to get as many of the services previously provided by New Zealand Post into our hub as soon as as possible so that that 's what I would like name the bill paying something like that because they do a whole host of things but I agree a little thing that I 've talked to it 's the bill pay yeah do it doing your Ridge over your car or what all this was yeah that everybody was yeah especially trying bills and at registration so moved by Jamie seconded by Rev yeah can I just put on wat sê add an amendment to this here an additional point that our staff work with his own post to actually see if there are other places or other as centers like some of this volunteer libraries because you didn 't post do a restoration of these of their post offices all over the city will lose them and reap closer loserman woolston so and obviously other areas so we 're really great if we could actually have that facility available yet or potential that facility made available some of our other areas which we can 't be against it yeah our staff to work with New Zealand Post on providing see this is through other see the centers libraries council all right um yani chi moans clarify because this isn 't that New Zealand Post providing the service as I read it this is about us providing is Elam post services at council is good for some yes so can I just check um in terms of you know that 's a change to a level service to change to an activity management plan there 's no consultation that we 've done on that everyone hang on no no no that 's great we 're hiring a staff member so I 'm not against doing I just want to make sure given the advice and fed previously two-day run the need to consult on these sorts of things because I I just I just want to understand how the space that 's in this library and what the staffing impact is on us as an organization given our financial situation where we sort of cutting a lot of cloth and now we 're taking on more staff and giving away some space and a building that wasn 't built for it to the post office they potentially we would need that increase the hours and one of our staff we will test that because apparently when New Zealand Post postal services of the days when we 're quiet so there is the future with our current starving that we just absorb there is revenue that was later comes across so so what happens is we commissioned themselves effectively ten percent on stem percent on packages intercept revenue cover the staff it would absolutely there is a belief that a bit cost neutral but then there may be and it may be that even if we were to offer someone else that the capacity is an agent for New Zealand Post to run other services through I think I just want us to do the work and know what that what those opportunities are because the more that we can offer you know I mean I don 't_''_386.53 personally agree with some of the decisions around some of these original assumptions reorganizations within New Zealand Post the trouble was is that there is a there 's a world of difference between even someone my age and somebody who 's in their lot of older people who are still quite mobile and everything they 're happy to jump in their car and go down to the post office but they are not going to go online to pay their bills or get their car registration or whatever so the more that we can do for you know our citizens the better all right so i will put that motion all those in favor say aye as opposed say no that 's carried _"

in and David yeah thanks and I 'm just going to ask with the proposed routes that the rune owner wants to how long is it going to take them to get everything in place to begin with where I 'm coming from as a wonderful forgives a bit China 's longer than to move on they didn 't give us a time frame foot they were basically saying that they 're waiting on the removal of batch before they can do their development but we do have funds for our works for 20 18 20 so that mean that 's the reason for the two-year timer okay beginning oriental 2018 after June is it 18 idea okay yeah 1819 sweet we could maybe push it out to the wrong we could push it up like we get that suit summer if we did a council works at the end of financial after fifa reason let 's trying to get them a bit longer i think two years is kind of really a short time what I mean in terms of the money bang on budget for the 2018 financial year I mean Pauling 's right it does run from the first of july through to the thirtieth of jane is that yeah possible to be to give them till that you could give them till after after the summer of 1890 yeah yeah so the yeah so so so the have for summer sleep including this in into februari oh well that 's awesome yeah no no well I mean yeah I killed by the end of march into March 2019 yeah all right so I 'm Paul just oh sorry sorry David David yani Paul look I 'm a little uncomfortable with this whole process and I really wanted what a sort of a an answer to the issue of legal road paper road we have a number of instances of houses batches or whatever that I on legal road that all of the tailless mistake batches and rotten right them cleanse dealing with the cartoon aveli where a number of houses are on a paper road as well why are we singling this one out when we tell us mistake for example we virtually approved that all of those houses on a paper road can stake so I find it a little bit rules for some rules for any explanation here the and it the other thing about Taylor 's mistake is I think some of those the red zone issues and Taylor 's mistake as well port hills red zone there 's no there 's no processed policy to say all all batches that were built in the 1940s will be removed the only reason this this is on the table is because the batches partly on a Maori reserve and the Runanga have already done a lot of landscaping and they 've already done a lot of work on a walkway and and on the PO carvings and things like that so so they have development aspirations for for that land and so does council on the foreshore as well so as I said that 's the of the property as Maryland and does the mostly does that the building actually sit on any Maryland yeah it does on the plan provider that 's into my questions Sorry Sorry tricking what I got sidetracked I 'm yani how much money we actually have on budget in 2018-19 for upgrade and also whether that 's been reviewed as part of the capital program with you I 'm not aware I 'm sorry I can answer with a capital program review we quote in here the price of the upgrade Oakley GT which is 170 170 thousand for the GT I mean there 's another so the toilet in the in the parks capital program was the landscaping picnic area around 25,000 replacement of the toilet others say the time for all that the duty a total of over 200 in the in the current capital program so I was just kind of wondering like if we 're going through a kind of prioritization program and we you know we 've got we 're working through that at the moment and how certain is that this project would be that we had and what the risk of is over energy not being on budget because of that I 'm sorry I can answer you know the priority and then just Brynden did you want to comment on it okay I think we got to understand the business case for over two hundred thousand dollars but just 5.4 team so but i just wanted to understand what the nature of those discussions were worth of that Jonah 's and where there was any consensus as to a way forward and whether that where that the report wasn 't on the table to learn if there where the report was coming back to Council and yes yes be fair to say the owners are said you resigned to the fact that the probably won 't be able to stay there and it was the grandparents who originally within the children now yeah so there 's been generations have use they use the batch so no one would be happy having to remove them Paul sort of understand first officer you see the generations have been there so the Renee know obviously for them to be here um I think I think originally they you know they were probably there at the grace because they did have a garden on the Maori resilient land and that type of thing but the response from the rune owner was that we 've been waiting a lot longer to do our development and yes so they they have a position as well okay we have got some better as you know there are on paper rose aluminum pedals they now just look at this map you can see the bottle wine is it is it without clothing line is cut into the back of a bit there 's that the party sitting on this very hot very that says very little so if we were aligned to we could actually sweet or white religious family paper when you get the move it smelling food and move their outhouse without BAC 80 paper right as curry well that cause any issues well yes they 're still in the road of the way they of the reserve redevelopment and that the pathway here you hooked I mean allowed to move on to the road and they don 't necessarily need to bring their path around that so they could bring their part by rather back the Runanga position was totally adamant they want the battery room no ifs no buts no moving no changing a real wall so they 're very clear in terms of their what you have changed a position from the generations to this generation where they just want this removed there now rebuild redevelop the area very very much even if it was on our legal road they still what it will move here but but they are looking to counselor to make the substantive decisions I just the part of worries me as we 've made other areas allowed to start our paper roads and this one will not mean that 's it 's just a consistency issues I think the film council we pulled it out I have an issue with it as well and it seems to me that the rune item could get on and do the development if there are mine too and if we were going to of things only a few feet and to paper road Jamie this is a tricky issue I reading the report that the batch was purchased in 1939 who did that transaction occur between so who was paid for the batch of 1939 I will imagine Lee so the big Croft Stuart family purchased the batch of 1939 from the previous owner who would have built at the okay in in the in those days people did things like that so did they get a title no we met no you never hit so they paid money for something but nothing no paper no titles so weird as existing buildings on we do I guarantee that so there 's no previous of the one of the things with other local communities putting anything towards what councillors phone in the syrian because as I said it 's business as usual and well as indicated on the photographs there 's a lot of work being done on the mirai and by the local ruler yes so the other is he lives but so but it 's dearly so as a development soomaali the doesn 't_''_869.79 so both for instance we 're doing a lot of development on our property we were given a report some time ago on the tears etc and a wolf sorry around being financially and one of the ways that we were trying to solve it financial problem was seeing if these communities would come doll doll or something to up these walls via dramas very cute by a number of other areas they see you star on board and it was a great way to go forward here 's this community down the sound was it all out I 'm sorry I can but I just don 't know okay sorry i was out of Jane to say a few words well I just wanted to clarify Council he 's made the point about Taylor 's mistake benches but we had actually and have been for some years and discussions with the residents association of earlier about the issue that they 're on a paper road so that they 're not being there is a process underway and we can provide a briefing on that specifically you can difficult to deal with the issue because obviously the community board you know it has considered that issue but only a small number of the community board are able to vote on it because this I think three conflicts of interest so that reduces the numbers who can vote on it and which is why probably and you know in a situation like this you 'd want the community board to be making the decision but in a way they almost can 't_''_977.02 because of the that the numbers who can actually vote which makes it hugely hugely challenging I mean I know that we said this at the time when we let it lie on the table we allowed it to you know we 've found it very difficult because you have two competing interests one of which is is dependent on us committing to expending money which actually really came up as a result of decisions that date back to before the earthquakes and we haven 't reviewed that process since the earthquakes is this up there as far as priority goes and a post disaster environment and that we shouldn 't do it now this is exactly the situation that we got on with the you know with the the wastewater or every way i knowi yeah and you know in it as unfortunate as it sounds but the truth is is that we have been through an earthquake sequence we are obliged to look at all of our works programs and whether they are suitable and a post disaster environment in terms of a priority so I guess what some counselors are asking is are the other mechanisms for funding this development that we haven 't considered and in some instances local communities have been asked to contribute have presumed it with the development there will be some development libby 's attached to to their web development contributions but I don 't know because I don 't know whether the rules are different for different types of development and that report seems to be silent on that matter so you know I I sort of feel like it 's in a difficult position I 'm do we actually have to make the decision today as the we could we refer this to the first meeting of the next council the first meeting next year and the first council meeting next year and and if you could come back to us what do some additional information about the process of engagement posted lying on the table last time and a some more information about the costs in the in the priority that might attach to the work that we 've already agreed to do in terms of the spend in that area because it may well be that we can give them a little bit more time then then what we 're proposing not in any way to stand in the way of the work that the Runanga want to do as is the right on their land but in a way that that we can sequence work in a way that might be a little bit more collaborative and you know sort of understanding of the circumstances I know that 's not an ideal situation but I 'm just thinking that we 're not going to get to a conclusion today I don 't don 't I mean if we owe so that leaves I 'll and if we voted to leave the beach there they would have no choice but to find a way to do the development will sit there although it 's on their land as well so well if the vet China chopped it but off it wouldn 't be ya know but but it 's not it probably isn 't that simple otherwise it would have been that simple so I just I just rather let it live for another other masculine and these people want to put it to about now damn I think there 's some Christian Simon I 've got some Christian why we 're spending this money because the scripts during development yes sir is it a priority Morgan hit a report about communities and some communities jumped at the chance of putting in for don 't you know I mean are we funding the other duties or not I can 't remember we are going to follow yeah yeah so it 's not fear and also what 's up who benefits from this what 's the from i think i might be best madam chair that we workshop this and yeah in the new year is that is that better because then we can discuss all these issues about community input because it is a disagreement conflicted members of the community borders near the workshop you know I can do this good it that sounds great thank you very much and thank you it 's it 's certainly not a reflection on the work that staff have done we really appreciate how challenging and difficult these issues are thank you you 'll be done with _"

was a recommendation that staff prepare advice on waiting 's and community board notifications and current delegations so so I 'm going to suggest that we just simply ask that that staff prepare advice on the waiting 's and commutable notifications and current delegations and then brings the paper back to Council and that way we 've got that information in the report for the adoption in Canada star some councils have other questions that they want included and that they contact me yes and so that we have or any other information that we 've gone that in the paper as well yeah so so we 're going to take out a and B that staff prepare advice on the waiting 's and community board notifications and current delegations and report back for the adoption of the operational lease policy all right I just wonder whether it would be useful actually the workshop with community boards hard to just look at extensions and isolation of other decisions they make around leases yep I don 't_''_112.28 I don 't see what the problem is here and I don 't see why be sorry i meant i bring i overlooked it I thought that it hadn 't been for biman tinnitus issues mayor for the example of the song icky with the previous place modifier to the head of the earthquake struck it was kind of just run is trying to make man is possible which is fine it 's a business decision or less complex the wind net finish and a newly see came and we chose as a commuting board to drop the amount of lace because I it 's and our building maybe our buildings we all know it 's a time about reaching grammas but what we needed was a I con venue for tremors and walkers and cyclists etc some information have seen we drop the fire property and that the price and the person that had the lease for the the cafe across the road from cherry picked it up at southwark and it actually turned it around it became I have two cyclists and walkers and peoples and so the community board had a sign that if it was going to be purely commercial what it obtained around and put the waiting 's and gone straight for return on and not just tell me at the moment and do do community boards have the delegation for the lease but not the renewal yeah we saw even it was good Oh Lucien decided to talk to who coming yeah exactly week on the community dude can I speak with this I between I wondered about this because my concern was there was only door selling little advice actually and the report and the memory than we had unfortunately I 'm having to point out that one of the I 've got the delegations the register delegations for during 14 these the previous ones and it 's quite clear that community boards have the power to its I 'm reading it from 5.1 to the power to issue and leases or licenses for the carrying out of trade or occupation on parks and my concern about the policies is now it actually has as term as indicating yes and even in the waiting 's there 's clearly the references are about commercial activity and it 's fine that 's what the lip for young the leases are about but there is also a social capital and committee component of us and that 's excluded and I think for us today to sign off a policy which doesn 't actually include those s speaks or even acknowledge it is actually just cutting at especially air Community Board Short and so I 'm just going to I think that actually see from strongly supporting see we just ask staff to prepare then it 's further advice and I take in splinters some brief advice here that 's really important clear specific advice how we do it I actually think that the only suggestion of having a workshop on this is a really good one and I understand the staff are fully prepared to do that and that would include community board chairs and counselors who want to make sure that this policy works sorry I process at strategy and Finance to develop a new lease policy okay which I think we should approve if people want to talk about community board delegations around this is that 's fine that 's a different issue okay we need we need to approve a new lease policy because the reason this happened is because we have an inconsistent Lee 's policy and we 're trying to give some consistency so that our leasing people actually know how to deal with leases that come up before the end of their expiry so I 'd like actually us to go back to a thank you and be and then if you want to see that 's fine but that 's a different story all together now where they have that actually provided the advice I think what we 're hearing is that some counselors are not happy with the with the waiting 's and I 'm not entirely happy that there are two different approaches one for leases and one for extensions of leases one that goes to the community board and one that doesn 't it comes to the you when this was discussed of strategy and finance so that there was support for many aspects of this but the worst summer was that gave support to the document on the basis that the community board involvement remains the same as it was and on the basis that we got further information about community board involvement in the process when it came to Council I think what we 're hearing today is that the the one line in here about the community board involvement isn 't the level of information we were hoping to see we know that leasing issues are discussed at community boards at the moment whether that 's in terms of decisions which are delegated or in terms of recommendations and what I 'm hearing from a number of councillors is that there 's a need to find out more about that before we can be comfortable agree into the policy if we don 't know exactly what the level of community board involvement is going to be compared to what it is now so it 's not just about the delegations it 's about the do this confidently than do it reluctantly with information I thought that the problem that we had in front of us was that we didn 't have a lease extinction policy it wasn 't we didn 't have a lease policy will have an extension you yeah he said I and that 's what the policy was designed to address was the extension and I guess that what we were saying at strategy and finance was that what we wanted to do was to see that the community board had the same role for the extension as they would have had if it was just an original lease but that but we have they haven 't got that delegation and this resolution doesn 't give them that delegation i think that 's that 's that 's in a nutshell i think where we got two and a pet that hasn 't been clear enough in terms of articulation caruso to it it 's to be fit entirely fielder staff what the committee had asked them to do was to click was to clarify or give more information around the extension here cameras then it just seems to me that the hot we don 't have another policy on the wider policy on leases for example where community boards fat and all that path and there is a really important part especially because very soon we are going to be extending community board delegations rather than reducing yeah that 's right so from some winners only place you come to intervening board you give the round a look at it and we suggest you to adjust its interests what 's the difference to you coming to community would say please a great unit or whatever we want to extend the lace and business cuz plc is the account executive so instead of regards to 8-under staff recommendations but delegate frozen products are there to film a policy and doing so in decisions of sole discretion so technically that your gates the community in way shape and form and Ben bar yeah I 'm sorry but angers here to go i miss the deadline for him leave and look I 'm just going to defer this to next week I just we do absolutely we need a policy but we need to clear policy and it to me it 's pregnant and we 've developed a clear policy and getting dragged down into the community board Meyer which is a separate issue all together which you can deal with any time you want to we actually what we need a specific policy around these leases what you bought it mr. Chairman I don 't think that sounds like an official and community boards to me no no no no what he 's saying is that it 's easy saying that it 's that it 's that it 's the question and it 's exactly what received before that there is the the lease policy and then there is the delegation issue and that 's what ref was saying dragged down into the community board Meyer is actually that who does the delegation who does the decision-making so it was not an aspersion on on community boards at all so n are you going to help us end of this mire if we seem to have dragged ourselves into football I think you an issue this policy is very much focus on the creation new leases an extension or quiz prior to expiry sounds very specific in there are community board delegations that support and new leases so we can certainly look to wrap up the new lease and situation in if it means own that we want more communication where community board level around this particular policy and kind of decision making me and we can make that happen yeah we do need a lease policy in relation to requests for expiry finally together which is a and B okay so so can you and Alan strike a and B and change see because they had provided faith-based request staff were to work with community boards around notifications and bring back about necessary to work with community boards around no to to notify community boards of any requests for extension of leases that yep and prepare advice for the council on the appropriateness of delegating the decision making to the community board okay is there a I 'm the gating the whole no because it 's actually separating the two issues you the Lego advisor we 've received around the south will brighten muddy can how does this policy relate to that those tears that we 're pretty clearly articulated in terms of getting best value for money like an accident to go back to this to saying but I think it 's appropriate I answered it no that 's right okay it 's just that we had quit I thought it was excellent advice around the staff to brighten my day camp which we didn 't have it this committee and that advice was pretty clear around really been open in in terms of procurement around the new test and local of an act so I just wanted to make sure that we 're not at risk of putting in place a policy which was contrary to that they advise that would receive when i was around the ability to do you know lettering with an existing tenant versus going out and being transparent no part of that part of the discussion around this particular policy was actually women every year wanting to assemble is a she tries to the expiry for sale over something we were going to be working with them to make it really transparent in a pen that this was business was served but it was actually a council property it was tied up with all of these and the Solis issue so it was definitely and it 's definitely part of this policy so that you 're fulfilling the obligations of procurement and wearing pay through an actual marketing for sale process but that that 's the kind of concern i wrote a committee which i still have and doing more so with that legal advice is that going out to market for the sale of the business for the business owner that that gets them the best return on their investment it doesn 't necessarily get us the best value for our facility I hang on hang on how that that 's the whole point that 's exactly the whole point is that by our staff working with them over the process of them selling their lease you actually end up having the best of both worlds they don 't lose and and we don the goodwill that they have built up on the business writs act we do because know each other because we end up with a rental agreement where we 've been through this a squillion times there does not let a shoe that we 're going to debate today we 've got requests that stuff I communipaw it to me request for extension of the lease and that 's in the meantime and prepare advice for the council on appropriate most of the delegating the decision to the community maybe we 've okay you think souls all of that so so we have we gotta move on a seconder for that more than Glenn sorry all of them each of them separately thank you okay so hip will put I am I am being first so i 'll put am beans all those in favor say aye those opposed say no so no to put up your hands Andrew full right um quarterback I 've got any called of refworks am yawning and i 'll put see i don 't know because we 've rewritten at those and we 'll put no that 's scary good thank you very much and do apologize to Angus for me that was my fault what else do we need to do ok _"

the partnership good governance and participation local body planning and processes those are our objectives and do it as a meeting you oh no I was just going to highlight a couple of things that we 've had recently this year for instance we had a woman 's meeting a woman leadership in the ward meeting two weeks ago when extremely well in the feedback was fantastic they would like one every three or four months but they 're not going to give it we we looked at the gap between the people in our community you can afford their kids to play sport and the people who can 't the membership of the Tennis Club individual which means most families a heck of a lot of families can 't put three kids into sports or can 't afford that kind of subscription we can 't afford to subsidize it but we are having a gear give and the end of March we 're going to have dropped spots all over our board for giving away sports gear not clothing gear and we 're going to have fun we 're going to have a huge amount of gear that we 're going to then you have a gear good day on match the 28th along with fit feast which will be a physical am sorry a sports day for selected people and we I 'd like to mention the walls of gates there in the plan for this year 15-16 we 'd like to see the work start I 'd like to mention the opening of rally cottage they 've moved into a premises that are a food the size of the old cottage and they will need big support from bios community board and council over the next year or two in order to be of our poorest communities and we 'd like to see them continue and continue successfully and finally our board of there 's one thing I 'd like to give kudos to the past for the native plantings that now pune way and horse will quarry which is just outside our ward they 're coming into their prime they 're full of birds they are magnificent salute to the staff in the past that had the foresight to do those plantings and finally we had their presentation from about pyro villagers and we 'd like the City Council to take up that project seriously for our communities so that we can develop village plans in our communities in our Ward 's so that the council will be looking looking at those plans before they develop LT pleased and so on we 'd like that pursued by the council because it was brilliant if I may I 'll just run through very quickly a list of issues in our ward so the upper wahoo heathcott river which is Helene mountain is an excellent work on the need to stop sewage overflows and Kashmir Centaurus roads which carolyn sending some work on that the intersections main intersections with that road are dangerous the need for a community facility in hoon a growing community Centennial coronation halls are gone and there 's lots of community interest and support accessibility accessible parking compliance in mapping and audits all of which the council has committed to and we 're also waiting on exists geralyn 's notice of motion eating substantive feedback around the council partnering and funding with organizations that are not house and accessible premises it means following up the board is united and wanting to protect eddington village from any increase in the capacity of lincoln road including and especially four-laning we do not want to see that go ahead the board has also wants to highlight how important the discussion around delegations is and I think it would be good to discuss it in the new year and sailing with the premise that boards can do most things and we wanted to note that that we understand why the review was done the way it was and the outcomes were the way it publicly that has ended up with cinnamon Eddington being somewhat split in two and Walter has an award that has little community interest with I know that you can 't comment on that but we 're just wanted to note that so thank you thank you good no thank you very much so i will put that motion all those in favor say aye no they

Albans working party terms of reference and so the community board am confirmed to prove those terms of reference and we 're just asking the council obviously to delegate the sides of the community board to go move by pauline second defy le i 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye I say don 't that 's very that was good we 're doing transport options and so this obviously came about with the concerns we have reforms to the congestion in after me going to try and reduce that congestion by putting and roading I 'm this concern that obviously this was a little bit I guess narrow-minded what the future mind ed in the community board wanted to look at raleigh 's as as a option for the future and where we sort of see things go in a sort of not really long that line now obviously there 's a lot of lot of different partners involved with this this process and from where we see this these partners sort of have a different priority then what we believe it should be and there seem to be more of a focus on roading options and where the community board believe we need to really truly look at rail is a really good option to move forward with obviously we have heavy rail tracks already in place and we think the council should pro ties looking at this as a really good option if not for long term especially in the medium and short term as well obviously you know if you 're building a city you would want a really good it 's slipping away as we do rebuild our city but it 's never too late to actually make this work and make it work properly so we need to make sure that we look at all the options and I just feel that we 're trying to avoid this conversation of heavy brow and I think it 's important that we don 't and we actually accept the challenge in and lead the council leader this is the one that could take a lot of time because the the issue is is that this has been on the agenda for the utes for a while it was it was put it was it was actually brought forward to look at it as a temporary solution and as a temporary solution financially it 's not viable because there aren 't enough people catching the train going to the same place the trouble was is that until people are coming back to the to the same place and you 've got a connecting point then it doesn 't make financial sense but we do need to investigate it but we don to be a shared arrangement and in terms of the cost of putting this on the council at this time while we 're doing so many other things in terms of the annual plan and our long-term plan we 'd have to put it in the annual plan as a separate item in terms of financing the research that needs to be done to support a business case it 's not just as simple of using the lines that are there no it needs to go through an annual crazy is but bad or it needs to go through that UD is and the u.s. refresh is happening at the moment I 'm sorry but it 's not our decision alone but staffer actually formed into work on a total integrated public transport system and want to include rail in there so and it will be part of an annual a word privia that we initiated a business case process for a future public transport study with strategic partners and to be integrated with the utes refresh is what started teacher partners because of who they are and what they not helpful with the sonuvabitch they turned it down because it doesn 't make financial sense what respect was respect this is why I knew that this would take home report looks at a short week one this later on the agenda yes but i have to take issue with user that he can reporters the measure for waters actually feasible and what 's not because there are problems with that he can reserve near washington i can report it was a year as a reward that was commissioned by EK know it was real it was a report committed by the UDS with respect he can as a member of the utes so and sometimes people get you know and that this is why i don 't want to have a long debate about so it 's a really important issue for surely probably nothing else to leave this because he never that 's there isn 't too accurate I mean isn 't accurate that they 're not interested the question is is that we ask them to look at it for a temporary solution it doesn 't make and there are challenges that have been made over some of the figures in that report yeah somebody some background information that could be useful to inform decision techny around the thing is is that I mean in terms of making it making a decision on where this goes to leagues I mean you 've made it clear Mike what the community board are after and I think that we just need to we 'll put this later on on the agenda and we 'll work up some wording that that will consider as a council okay is it all right yeah yeah I think it 's a former cell person we do need to make sure that our vision does work for the future so how we 're going to get people and from the north to ease that congestion to me when I look at these things it just seems to be leaning away from rail now I don 't know I 'm not an engineer so I don 't know if that is the number one answer but to me when I look at the partners involved just sometimes think that maybe the transport hierarchy it 's not the same as what it should be from our side and it 's just good to see that I guess we take a real good stance in this position yeah okay so can I just comment Mike I certainly admire the work that you 've already done and ask for however at council we need to consider rail as part of a future network and what the SE committee is working on is looking at rapid public transport and and so that there is a way forward that council do that so I think with suggestions from your board to come when we look at us to come to the infrastructure transport environment committee that will be a way forward so that the whole network of transport and Christchurch was considered and this part of it is certainly that would certainly be taken to account and so will defer this one the proposed Road names would someone like to move the proposed Rodin 's ya le Pauline I 'll put that motion with all those in favor say aye reserved the community board recommendation i presume pauline moves seconded ally I 'll pop that motion all those in favor say aye as opposed say no that 's carried and the last two that the report be received only on the to board meetings moved by Ellie sikanderpur lean but Mike that 's an opportunity for you to say a few words um obviously time 's running out I 've got to go as well I was all I had to acknowledge that great counselors I 'm sorry I 'm doing they 'll also be acknowledged over the great stuff we do have chili pepper in the other board members surely peps I guess quite a wide diverse area and we have areas in the red zone brooklands and then we 've got other places we don 't really hear much from who obviously doing quite well and we 've got a lot of networks out there that do great work before they 're volunteers staff to help the communities we do here quite a bit from certain areas and which are struggling still and there 's some big concerns have and we are working towards I guess rebuilding some of those facilities and I think it 's really important over the next time ten months before this tumors out that we put some things in concrete that we know it 's going to be there for the future for our community groups so that 's I think there 's some positive things happening next month we got the Belfast skatepark that 's going to be open up so we 're all looking forward to that that 's another good good step forward I 'm so things are progressing nicely huh never as fast as we 'd like but it is it is good in there yep thank you very much and I 'm sorry that things have got to a stage like that and i think it was there was a desire to deal with the coastal hazards report at the same time that the sum as we 're here so you know thank you very much for your patience and consideration I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye as opposed they know that 's carried and _"

they 've just launched couple of weeks ago the latest fundraising campaign which is an excellent series of Harrington 's beers it 'll be for sale with with East jury can 't type labels on the front the muddy duck and the road cone read and ward reach and a great beers that are gonna be for sale at local supermarkets leave them and money from the sale of those goes towards the Mount Pleasant Community Center rebuild which is really really good so if anyone 's looking for gifts for friends and relatives over for Christmas right local supermarkets for that for the map please and communities into fundraising beers it 's really really good we have some replacement wording for yep number two which there we go so and that would allow for the least to include a controller that allows the annual rent to be way for the first three years and then reviewed 3 yearly releasing a sporting community facilities at least to include a condition that the lease or will share with Alessi up to fifty percent of the cost of maintenance and repair of the building users community center with such share of cost not to exceed seven thousand dollars per annum + GST reviewed at the time the three-year lyrium review yeah I mean I think that and I mean for the first few there shouldn 't be a lot on the way of maintenance yeah yeah but it worked though people I mean there will be it will be some maintenance things you know to do with you know cleaning out gutters and to do with the left and those kind of things but but not a huge amount and so reviewing it through yearly I think will be really good I have a key thing to remember here is that this was this building was specifically funded as a war memorial with with government in community matched funding on the condition that the counsel at the time took on the maintenance costs and perpetuity and while that 's had a the council supporting about this and community center again having it in community ownership and running it is actually a huge benefit to the council if like many others that had folded and go on to Counsell ownership council be facing all of these costs now but the community are doing an amazing job on the center I did notice that you obviously got a young person to do that they 're typing up of the of the old documents because they obviously didn 't recognize the word called yards you know it used two meters and various things these days so that it reads that it reads them after investigation the complaint agrees that the center should be placed approximately 60 years east of the original funny so that 's yeah yeah either than the future the period its practice yeah but I hadn 't no I one bit yes yards and I think but but but it just it shows how important it is to go back to the source documents that 's your eyes for me that was the that was the kicker yeah at the originally nearly memorial community center that 's run by the community it 's right there is a war memorial yeah and you know this is the hundredth anniversary of the other First World War and I just think that to reinstate that commitment as I think the way to go so and thanks to the community board for really pushing to get taken away we 'll get that result I know that but it 's it 's really good to have a nun there and it 's great to see La Source like you 've done the homework you know it 's right that 's kind of one of what I want to reinforce end and to sort of say that it really does help when the communities you know take responsibility for doing that and it pays off in the long run Paul you would you like to move it yep move it and seconded by yanni yep okay pull this one just want to say quickly look at these guys as you 've seen that over this last couple of years have been really really quite creative and actually don 't keep coming working for us for continued support and and its really great arrest you also reflecting on xev past documents because it does state perpetual maintenance on the memorial so that was our commitment as a local and as from central government so good that we 're going to reinstate that as part of us here it will be a contribute aptitude for 15 or seven thousand dollars maximum so I 'm really really open that councils of support this motion today and get these guys back on their feet give this facility this say she really needed back rip belongs and as I say thanks to the community out there who have done such a great job as well so actually yep Yanni thank you um all support community board recommendations at the community were meeting up I would have preferred that we just put it back into the system of council facilities that it used to be so that actually we didn 't specify in a mouth but what used to happen is we have a technical advisers base of the community board service in world and the groups would put on request whether it was a management committee or whenever a group that own the facility 's that had this relationship like this one to get maintenance done when the need arose so maybe in time we can get there but for today I think this is a good compromise to get re-established that commitment that was made and recognizing the cumulative foot that the malfeasant community center they 've put into into getting the rebuild done which they 're frequently as the short the shortfall as a result of the variations of the insurance requirement to build a replacement facility so i think is great i urge cancers to support this my understanding is there are is probably two or three other buildings in a similar situation within the city places that are owned by the community but the council has historically had a working relationship what for whatever reasons so you know it 's not it 's not a huge president but is recognizing the existing relationship i think the other two things i just want to point out was that one as we as we go forward we have asked previously as a community board American customs got a resolution to look at our leasing policy in terms of charges ironically the rent that they paid previously was higher than the ring of the cricket oval the professional cricket pavilion and oval and higley car so it does seem that we do have some anomalies and it would be good to get that work happening so that we had a bit more of an understanding the other thing is that this is we talk a lot about communities actually doing things in a different way this capsule wants to engage communities in a different way but let 's not lose sight of the fact that we have some existing communities they actually do have progressive ways of working that we should celebrate and a fort and you look at the social enterprise aspects to ask what perhaps a new facility can deliver on you look at the way in which this community has fund raised and worked with the wider people in the mouth is an area to achieve the results critical and look at a new way when we 've got existing ways that actually our role model highlight I guess a best practice in terms of working with communities so I think for a small contribution we make as a city we get huge value in return and mouth isn 't as quite a big area they have faced huge disruption on a personal level with earthquake issues I think someone said a third of the houses had to be the repaired or rebuilt which is quite significant and on top of all of that they 've got on and just try to get the facility back up from running so is you support us today I 'm probably supported although i 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's scary can you turn to page 329 because we 're now going to deal with the mount a community center insurance coverage so just get that because it 's the same issue or the same facility that 's not come through the community board process but the request of the board proposal was to receive the information and the report which recommends that they take out their own insurance it was good it was just done a way of making sure they get the best option because they 're previously were insured through the council you but it definitely looks like it 's not the best option now be stopped before uh see that probably wasn 't the best option back then yeah i just looked jealously jealously at the art center and it 's you know sort of the early settlement of insurances major friend difference anyway moving fine le second of four later course which i 'll put the motion i got it right that time don 't be mean I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye

report December 12 and we have a recommendation to change the scope in accordance with consultation procurement to follow a design and build process reporting back to Council cetera et cetera and I

now confused gleam with David so that there 's something wrong with my eyesight so stop this but David isn 't here and I know he 'd like to see it but oh oh yeah yeah again fellow fellow secret so I think think of you um yeah it 's worth great delight that would bring this report to you it 's been a long journey I do want to start by just feeding back that the community all the feedback that we 've had from the community is that this doesn 't meet the aspirations of what they 're after however they do understand the financial state that the budget is set at 30 point five million in 6.5 million for the toys and I 'm very pleased to report that I think we have stretched that to the max and I think we have gotten absolutely fantastic facility and I know that the process has been long in at times a challenge but I think that it has meant we have got a much better outcome as far as the facility did you want me to go through some of the things that we 've changed page 52 43 or do you want just to go and hood well I think just a quick synopsis people have read the paper yeah so I think one of the big things more Swami area and so to do that we have increased the learners pull from 16 meters long to 25 meters long this does gives us this gives us now to 25 meter pools and the facility and to do that we obviously had to find some savings elsewhere and so the council would be very good at working very hard to define those so they found them and two main places one was reducing the movable floor to half and we 're more than happy that that still meets the usability option obligations of what we 're hoping for and the other thing is changing the pool tank to stainless steel obviously we know from all our aquatic experience that lighter is bitter and earthquakes and so stainless steel was obviously better than concrete and they 're also decreases the geotech costs so we 're really happy with the outcome we think that that does go some way to satisfying the community aspirations in the lay some of the concerns around the size of the facility in relation to the population usage the toys 13.6 I think we 've toys the Hydra slide of you can imagine it 's a combination of a normal hydro slide with the Super Bowl that set hemnes Springs yeah it 's got it you 're right on on little inflatable rafts and as you go down the hydro slide it 's several points along the journey there 's these little spinny but globes that you go into that some somewhat similar to the Super Bowl so we think that 's really a fantastic deal for the east we think that gives us a really good point of difference from other hydra slides around they 've been a nun like that in the South Island the the playground the adventure playground that that 's similar to the one at here Marv Springs that we think those are really fun very useful the lazy river what the community seemed quite loud and clear that they wanted a big lazy river however when we look to that that would have taken up almost all our leisure space so what we decided to do was go for the medium one but put it on steroids so we hear we 're going to add into the middle of it of imagine it 's a figure eight in the middle sort of dead spots we 're going to put active spars we 're calling them for for the ective relaxes or the mothers that want to get a few a bit of a back massage or they watching the kids go go around the the thing so we managed to soup it up and in that 's something that we wouldn 't have got we hadn 't had this consultation period so it 's really quite a buzz to see that we 've been able to to get better than what we could have had we just gone through the normal normal process we 're really stoked was with all the other the other elements are fairly standard your little would have bucket dunkers and splashes and those sorts of things but we 're really pleased with that with the way that that negotiation and discussion went on with staff the board had a meeting where we got to play they made cutouts of all the different things we the end of the evening we had ours laid out on the table of what we 'd come up with and then the architects brought the air one that they 're done and they were just about identical which really goes to prove that the board had bit had had enough information we 'd been given them all the right information that we could make the decision that the professionals would also come up with so it really confirmed to us that that we have been well informed and well included in the process that we 're now up to speed enough to have made those those those calls so yeah really really delighted to present this today it 's been a fantastic journey I 'd like to think the staff I know we 've pushed them too the limits sometimes of being a bit demanding and things but they 've stepped up and it helped us to journey through this thank you Andrew and I against speaking on behalf of the entire council it was always going to be challenging replacing a metro sports facility with a community facility by the previous counsel before we were elected and before we knew the true state of our finances and what you know references to jelly part might mean two different people always a very challenging environment but I think it 's better to be honest with people tell people what the financial situation is and then set expectations and engage people in the process and I think you know given that you were handed a poison chalice and one respect you 've just turned it into a magnificent outcome so I just want to congratulate the whole community board and the community group that you engaged in that process and the groups in the children I loved being part of receiving all of these fantastic ideas from the children it 's been an incredible process and apart from the way it started I think that you 've turned it into a really really good result for the east so they 're not having a metro sports facility that 's going into town they 've got an amazing community facility on the way so thank you very much for that you think we should go straight to debate okay you will you haven 't got it do we need staff at the table if you 've got questions I wish that we 'd be notified of this young John would you like to is there anyone else that 's got questions Andrew okay so Yanni thank you thank you John thank you for coming to the table I just wanted to give I guess just a contrast in terms of the size of the water space that was available so just if you were comparing it to existing capital facilities knowing that 's going to heavy unique order features like the Hydra side is this more comparable slight Graham condom in terms of palm size or a bit more over lunch at a park or is it kind of the closest facility we have in terms of size counselor is jelly park the proposed design is has far more indoor water space than jelly park they what it doesn 't have is the extensive outdoor water space that jelly park as they but it 's uh that the closest comparison would and considerably bigger than pioneer there 's a bit without the additional water features like the hydras lot yes inkay angry and yet two very quick questions on page 243 in table 2 the first line there is around reducing the movable floor to half the pool area and we 're saying it doesn 't reduce the facility flexibility or usability what was the reason that we were looking at more than half in the beginning and is there really no impact of reducing this to to have sighs there 's really no impact the the purpose of the movable floor is to allow multi use of the main pull the there is no real need for the whole of the main pool to be shallowed and there 's always a need for some area of deep water I think the inclusion of a movable floor for the whole of the pool area initially was as much of a costing exercise as as anything the and it just allowed a little bit of flexibility should we wanted to lift the the whole of the pool floor it became clear very doing that and and that the board was able to consider it and drop the requirement quite quickly yep that 's great thank you for that and then second very quick question on page 24 6 paragraph 14 point 7 obviously a shortfall of 600,000 I 'm just keen to know that there is a very high level of confidence that we will be able to find the savings that are noted in 14.7 I yes there is we and the board staff and the board challenged our internal project manager who in turn challenge the external quantity surveyors and they 've all confirmed that they are very comfortable with this and history has shown us be able to do this so yes there 's a very high level of competency right I 'll open it up for debate then okay thank you it 's tremendous to get to this point many of you will realize that the community 's pushed hard on this with the the community board and it 's very appropriate given the significance of this complex for the community and the loss and their hopes for staff as as John would know i would like to think as a council you will see that in terms of that 1.1 million dollar saving we 've done quite well so they have been three savings there to go together by pushing on the stainless steel Paul that 's also a ground of remediation saving by pushing back on the movable floor that 's another scene in this we are protecting the contingency I 've had a conversation with mark whose last name escapes me mark do not mock Noonan who 's built five or six or seven complexes in the city he is happy with this procurement Rutten to build and design in terms of protecting that contingency so I think in relation to the kind of financial stewardship of it we 're on sound ground there and I think if we remember how this looks in terms of the wider context I describe it as an arc of investment in the east with the build hospital to ordinary campus hopefully investment and you brighten as well you put this in together and you 're starting to ship tremendous once this is up and running along with the two schools this really will be a desirable and exciting hub for people to come to and it really will start to build back confidence and the people of the East okay David thank you I think we 're all well aware that it 's been a subject of intense debate in our part of the city and I 'm very pleased to see that we 've we 've come to a resolution at the end that I believe we 've stretched the budget as far as we possibly can we 've got as much facility into this complex or new facility that we possibly can and I 'm really buoyed by a comment i think that came out at our last board meeting that we believe that this will end up being the preeminent suburban swimming facility in christchurch there 's always been a lot of angst I suppose in our community that we lost qe2 the funding from the finance from insurance and all sorts of things was put into Metro sports in town and that in itself we 've gone through a great process here to reach where we are now there was a lot of debate about this the comment about something better than jelly park I believe we are better than jelly park and in terms of indoor facilities and one extremely important aspect of the final concept that we signed off on was the board borders extremely adamant that a parcel of land and that complex or adjacent to it needs to be earmarked for possible future expansion so if and if in the next five or ten years the city needs or urgently needs expansion of swimming facilities we have the scope to do that at qe2 and that to me was a very important aspect of the final sign off for the board so I think you know despite the fact that there has been a bit of community angst over 50 meter pools 35 meter falls I believe we 've come out with the the best solution we can with the money that we have allocated and we have really gone to great lengths to to really stretch their budget and meter 10 meter wide learn to swim pool which is far far bigger than anything else in town so I just like to offer my thanks to to John and newnan and Simon Patrick that were heavily involved in this project and we have engaged extensively with Warren and Marnie and a few other consultants to actually get a good feel for how that the pool should end up we 've traveled to every other major pool facility and in the greater of Canterbury area ashburton to rank your pick the bones out of all of these facilities to come up with what we believe was good for our community so very very happy to endorse what we have had before us today and I think it 's ultimately a great outcome that 's great oak output yeah _"

kind of a pattern of ridges and Spears and each one of those circular section type roads and is on one of the broad spears and in between as the gullies and below the main road that winds through diamondharbour the land and the gullies and along the foreshore is all reserved at shaded green and above the current residential area is confusing as this fun of land here and that was all owned by the council diamond harbour was was a farm which was bought by london borough originally as a garden suburb for people living in austin which had got pretty grotty at the time and so that land has always been intended for the growth of littleton and of diamond harbour and it will be so the next slide please so this is the one that 's annual report but you can see the shadows of vegetation is and this there 's this one here is Hunter Scully that goes into Church get Bay that 's already a scenic reserve management dot and this is the one in question Morgan 's Gunny but there are two others Sam Scully and this one which doesn 't have a name on this block of blend and that is what the community association have asked us this is particularly Morgan Scully which is the one where the walkway goes up is the one that the community association is asked to look at reserving so actually what happens if I do it yes so there 's the sign for the mount here that walkway and the walkway gives access to all of the bank 's financial walking network which can be accessed by the public transport system using the theory here some local people clearing horse and getting ready for planting here are some people planting in the gully here at some plants establishing in the galley oh that should be we just thank you they need a system called gravel as you travel we took a bucket of gravel young people doing that I mean just one and they formed a track that provides an alternative route to school not using a main road which can be quite narrow in here and here is the opening day of that new track with most of diamond harbour school on the trip this is the second gully sands going to give you an idea of what the land is like that we 're looking at at all thank you so the pinnacles recommendation on this is on page 67 right I think that certainly from my perspective I 'd like to see a report from Council rather than just having a notice of motion without you know that you know the alternatives and you know that I mean that 's the process under the local government eat yeah so so does anyone feel like moving that it be referred to council staff for a report and do we want a time frame for report back and you two more second it 's a mood to neck and a seconded by Andrew and term so that the council requests a staff report land of 27 hunters Road dana-farber as a reserve the purpose of community leader II vegetation it would be good to put a timeline yeah but I mean we 've got a community and a highly motivated to do good work in this area assume that we got what I realize that guy I don 't know who can answer bit from staff is there a realistic time frame for report on that end of March as a in the March okay by the end of map request a staff report by the end of march on the proposal and would that come to would that cut go back to the community board so would you like to consider that report before we do so we could report back to you and and march and then it can come back to us well do you want to look at the reporter a good tactic to consider it yet so now request staff report through the community board yeah by the end of month and that way that it goes through you been to us right Yanni was just trying to lot of it looks like it wouldn 't really be suitable for development we don 't we don 't want that we 're going to we 're getting a staff report so there 's no point asking questions about the detail now because no no it with yanni it 's going to come back to us for a decision we don 't need to know the answers to those questions today on dreams of our interference at Colin Andrews yes just clarifying process so we 'll have a report will come to the community board I 'm fine end of March yeah the community board will then consider that before they will make a make a recommendation to the council based on that report and then council will make it yes no that 's though we don 't need to we don 't need detail today about the decision the community board meetings are usually in the middle of the month so okay well request a staff report be provided to the little son mount who the community board meeting and March yeah right okay so we don 't really yeah I locked all that I made mustard what 's the value of the land said no I 'm saying we 're not making a decision today we 're making a decision to get a report so it really we don 't need to know all about now we will know their information when it comes back to us but at the point is is that the paper doesn 't include all the information that will be in the report that 's why we need a council report right I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye or as opposed say no that 's carried _"

    "text": "so let 's moved by David and second up by Glenn so right is there any discussion yeah II think thank you for this report I think it is really important that we do acknowledge the concern that has been expressed and we do need to take action and regards to the stress that the dominant at a report in the district plan review has caused in our local communities this isn 't actually a coastal issue this is a city white issue I want to stress that point because although a lot is talked about the coastal hazards I think in some ways that misrepresented impact that this has on entire communities within a city that actually are nowhere near the coast but are impacted by what has been proposed and the impacts of the chunkin and taylor report so I welcome the opportunity to get a peer review on this I think it 's important that we do acknowledge that the district plan fast-track process has been unsatisfactory on a wide number of levels least of which as the community to actually understand how we 're making land what the different options are and what the potential outcomes could be so this is a i think has step in the right direction in terms of addressing just one area of it which is obviously cause a lot of concern i think the issue around the lumps is really important and you know i am concerned that we have a report that has had a lot of red flags raised about it informing the building consent and i appreciate the work that the mayor 's done and that regard in terms of getting changes to the RMA and the building act so that perhaps we can take a bit more of a more straightforward approach to how we do assessments because if it 's not on the right legislation then obviously getting that focus that 's really critical but i do just also want to thank the the crusher to coastal residents go I do think you know that 's been a huge amount of time if an energy dealing with issues that that we should have been dealing with I appreciate the work that they 've done towards affected and you know I just want to say you know place on record that we should commend him for their questioning of what we 're doing so that you know at the end of the day hopefully that as a result of this process will get a much better outcome for everyone concerned and we need to just be really clear and what our messaging is because I think that 's been also cover the other frustration is that in some messaging has made it seem like we don 't want development on the coast other messaging has been that we want to enable things to happen as a city so actually working out what we what we intend to do very much wider broader and longer consultation and engagement process I think is the right approach clean thank you just two points in relation to this I support the recommendations in relation to the tonkin and taylor report with what i see before my questions I think the credibility is now looking questionable secondly over the tendering process yes they are oag guidelines but they are there for to abide by the rules at this time to even if time as a factor as you 've said mere previously we need these conversations over a longer time and that 's actually what set behind the coastal information hub anyway but however it happens it 's the process that hasn 't been good I have some questions over the science but in the main I support it but it 's the process it 's been far too damaging for our communities Paul I 've gotta support the resolution I think it 's really important that I think I 'm really pleased to see them come to this point when you 're dealing with something so contentious as sea level rise and the science around that I think we need to be responsible and and peer reviewing and getting the best science possible and taking time to door because obviously something that affects our city to such a degree and we hear thirteen percent that is reasonably significant and it has a massive impact on how we su develop in the future so you know purse on a little bit up and put a national policy in place it actually guides the local authorities so we don 't end up in this position and we have a large part of our country which has a lot of population living around the coast we 're going to see you know potential litigation or am around the casual side and you know the opportunity for inconsistencies and the policies that the local authorities put in place so I welcome this here I want to get the best possible science or they can be across the world come from for our city going forward and I think we do take time do it properly and actually do it with our community okay so I reiterate think again thanks for the quality of the report that staff have provided last night as was really reports i was listening to radio and the first draft of the Paris agreement was coming through and I took a note what what that first draft see it about climate change and it 's that climate change is an urgent and potentially irreversible threat to human societies and the good for the local communities and this Council and staff in the Commissioner for the environment are taking it seriously and I work I really am hope that our central government also takes it seriously and providing that national framework which has been referred to what and I think that the at this point that ask you for the further peer review that that certainly should assist a decision making and but also the they comments the staff and if the stuff it 's a staff wrong to make them put them on the limb so that they 're that we ensure that they are clear and accurate and we ensure some fairness and there 's no question around the tonkin and taylor report or any report on sea level rise that they are based on assumptions but it remind console errs the tonkin and taylor report has already been peer reviewed and that pair of you said that the assumptions was based on the fear and the results were valid again though it is really I think a good science to obtain another further peer review so and I were legally obliged to put that information on limbs under that and on Laguna and so there 's really no grounds at all that air council head to withhold that information so i think that certainly not only the people in the East but all the people in Christchurch are entitled to through the clarity around us and so I 'm certainly supporting their recommendations I 'm thank you this is quite a momentous day for me I think way back in the early stages of the district plan process I did express my concern about that process and particularly relevance of aspects of the Taunton and taylor report so that the process that we engaged in at the time was rushed the significance and importance of coastal science was not given the creatures that i think it really deserved our community particularly our residence on the coast of pennington sort of glanced over the coastal hazards provisions and coastal inundation the TMT report was questioned on several fronts and found one in wanting that 's my opinion but I 'm very confident that that was supported by a vast and the field I 'm continually reminded agreed to a degree but Peter big saying the wisdom of the people far exceeds the knowledge of the experts and grudgingly I have to accept them he 's been right in there one the government removed the planning provisions there was an assumption in our community that we were starting with a clean slate the LGA provisions I think at six and 44 a paragraph to whatever really state that if we are in possession of information that suggests as a potential hazard we have to acknowledge that there is a philosophy that I have struggled with intently I have now come to the realization that I can 't fight that and that the the way forward that we are now approaching I did prepare a notice of motion which I had hope may come to this meeting what it is due to go to the dpr meeting next week excuse me if this motion is passed i withdraw that nomination my objective has always been to remove the tonkin and taylor report and subsequent limo information that 's been attached to the broom report earlier on and when we look at our open coastline the use of the broom method is totally inappropriate that method applies to a beach and static condition we have a coastline that is a grading at a considerable rate anjali and hence gives rise to a number of the criticism of the tonkin and taylor report the parliamentary commission for the environments report was released last month the Commissioner was reasonably critical of waiting on limbs and we are taking steps to address there and I think there 's a couple of comments that she made in her report that i want to emphasize today councils must use science that is fit for purpose and engaged with the community in a measured way with empathy secondly we must plan for sea level rise but there is time to do it carefully it is more important to do it well than to rush so I 'm very happy to support this motion today I believe the resolution provides a measure of closure for this issue peer reviewing by a scientific clinic panel approved by just groups very action plan post proceed of the peer review to actually look at where we 're going to go forward not only with our future planning that with the wording that is on limbs at the moment the third and important thing is that it does acknowledge the building act provisions and a desire to have them move to the Resource Management Act I think that 's a very smart move as well and as our mayor has indicated we are at a point in history when we have the same minister for the environment and the same minister for building control so no other time in history where we have that opportunity to have put that resolution into place I 'm I 'm told that our staff have been trying for a number of years to correct these anomalies and hopefully we are in a position to do it finally I just like to say we are now giving ourselves the ability to restart this process in an open and transparent manner in accordance with the parliamentary commission for the environments guidelines and I would trust that this process goes do get to a stage where we can start with a clean slate and do as the commissioner says this process and of timely manner it 's more important to do it well than to rush thank you very much thank you and um because you move the motion you 're entitled to have the last word but premier and but all i want to do because I 've already spoken is really to thank staff it 's taken three different tranches of the organization to bring this together let 's take our planning staff it 's taken our legal team and it 's taken our building control team so and and the three have them have actually pulled together all of the elements that we 're really outstanding as a result of the decision to pull this out of the district plan review process that we that is in place at the moment I do want to acknowledge the community that the group that 's presented this morning but also all of the other community groups that have been engaged in the process since the notification occurred zero there there 's there is a desire to address areas that are particularly vulnerable there are differences between coastal erosion and coastal inundation and you know even myself found myself and I coastal inundation area night love and bored but I was already in a flood management area so I guess in many respects I wasn 't surprised so there 's a lot of work to be done and this puts us on a very stable platform can I just acknowledge all councillors for the respect and the understanding that you have shown in terms of the way that this issue has been dealt with this morning I really really appreciate it so on that note can i or in one other thing the parliamentary commission of the environment has agreed to come down and do a public session and februari next year so that 's as soon as we can get her down here and I think people will really value the opportunity to be able to hear from her directly and to start that very much more extensive and appropriate public conversation about the realities of living in a so on that note can I put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried unanimously thank you right _"

    "text": "so thank you very much for all of the effort that you 've gone to it 's much appreciated right we have the coastal hazards team up to the table I 've proposed a couple of amendments to the resolution that was published so I 'm not sure whether we neither a formal movement of that or you 're just prepared to accept them and the reporters now well I 'm always somebody special efek to the communities and they need to write affected communities that would be I 'm a bit of a you know sort of grammar queen I 'm afraid but ok so i think that what why don 't we have a why don 't we have that questions or staff and then we 'll come to the resolution but i can 't see any are you happy with the wording that we hear a slight adjustment of well i think in education we 've just heard there was a desire to as a song yeah a desire to engage with the affected communities in terms of selection of the peer review panel and that 's of the peer review needs to be reflected in the limb notations if the peer review comes back and severely criticized as aspects of the report that should be reflected and what goes on the limbs as well so i 'm just want to make that connection between the peer review reports ultimately yeah and also but we would retain three which also requires an immediate review of the limitation yeah so and yeah I think that just in terms of a little bit of background ever since the government agreed that they would take this item off the agenda and I think it 's interesting some of the comments that have been made that the process I think that we were under dictated timeframes that we couldn 't possibly manage and that what really got lost in the whole process was the time available for community engagement before notification so there 's no question that people have worked hard on community engagement post notification but at that stage people felt that there was nothing that they could do about what was going to be publicly notified in the process think a lot of people quite justifiably felt we they weren 't going to be able to get the level of scientific advice in order to to to challenge the the tonkin and taylor report or to challenge the the notification that that we had made and you know that the independent hearings panel process has been very legalistic i think a lot more legalistic than people had anticipated from the outset that certainly wasn 't that way in littleton with a little tongue recovery plan and that went through an under pendant hearings panel process which has been quite different the auckland process has been quite different so i think what we 've ended up with has been really a combination of a almost an appellate jurisdiction at the front end of a hearings process and that has been extremely difficult for people and it 's been one of the drivers why the council wanted to take this away from the independent hearings panel process and take a full year of public gagement before we even start a process that will lead to a notification under the RMA we up and that they will provide all of the council 's our new zealand that have coastlines with the technical advice and support that we need and we all need it it 's not just Christchurch as exactly as has been said it 's not just Auckland it 's not just Dunedin it 's not just in bokaro it 's everywhere that has coastal hazards because the way the coastline interacts with the sea depends on a whole lot of factors so we need advice centrally provided advice and guidance and then we have to look at our own coastline and determine how that advice operates here and I think that I don 't think anyone really thought ahead of putting the entire district plan through this fast track process which is in the interests of the city in so many ways because we 're recovering from an earthquake but in this particular issue it hasn 't been a very good process at all so that after the government agreed to take this out of the process I knew that the problem wasn 't going to be resolved unless we point that I realized that there was no point addressing the lumps if he didn 't address the building aid and I think what this has done as it has brought to everyone 's attention that the building act provisions that require the land vulnerability to natural hazards to be taken into account is in the wrong piece of legislation it shouldn 't be in the building act it should be in there are ma that 's where the land protection provisions should exist it 's where the existing use rights provisions exist and the two of them should be together so it seems to me that we now have a probably an appropriate to use the phrase perfect storm but we do have a perfect storm and that we have a resource legislation amendment bill before parliament right now and I 'm speaking to people in the back of the room as well and I 'm hope they 're taking notes about making a submission on it because to transfer the building act requirements and to the resource legislation amendment bill i think is very doable and the reason minister for building and construction is the minister for the environment perfect storm we have the same minister who understands completely that the building act provision is in the wrong piece of legislation and we have an immediate opportunity where we can see that change occur our own building consent staff have been meeting with mb to pursue this and had a meeting as latest monday which is why this paper was late being requested and on the agenda today so we 've had different streams of work going on within the council in order to bring us to this position and and you know it 's kind of ideal really that we 've been able to get this on the agenda today so i think the counselors that did have a couple of questions that they just wanted to to raise and david i wanted to start with you because you hit a question that you wanted to put to staff on one of the aspects although you may infect have now had that resolved by the amendment and term you hit her yep so is anyone got any the first is in relation to the current status of that tonch and taylor report so given that the parliamentary commissioner for the environment has now put some distance between her report and the tnt report what is the status of that report and given also that it 's going to be now well I won 't second-guess the council but I suspect the council will agree to being care review I think it 's its credibility is is under question so how does that now hold up in terms of limb and given that ready that the chapter and the lynnwood kind of my view tractor-trailers so if you take one out surely the other has to go as well the the parliamentary commission of the environments report and the section looking at christchurch and there 's two or three sections actually that look at christ church has not reviewed the tonkin and taylor report as such what she 's looked at is how we 've used the information and the tonkin and taylor report to inform the comments on them in particular and she 's cast some she expressed that it 's not clear enough and that in terms of the inundation information because it 's so succinct it it could be seen to imply that the risk is higher than it actually is for a particular property so we need to clarify those comments and how we 've how we have expressed the base information and report but the base information and the report itself remains valid and and that has been peer-reviewed just have one more just over that the actual tendering process our procurement policy asks that we obviously have an open transparent process over contract so you please explain how toppling Taylor were what did the contract Tom and Ann Taylor are well known and very well qualified consultants in terms of the coastal hazards work and they 've done coastal hazards with for a number of councils right around New Zealand the reason that they were appointed to do the 2013 sorry the 2013 report and the 2015 report was that they had already done our coastal hazards assessment for Christchurch back in 1999 and we needed those reports very quickly to provide very tight timeframe and they were able to do that work in the time frame available so if if we 'd had a proper time frame and we weren 't under the pressure of the district plan review it would have gone to a an open tender it yes it may well may or may not have gone to an open tender and and Tonkin and Taylor may or may not have got that you but that was the only reason for going straight to them was the time frame we were under and the fact that they 'd already done an assessment back in nineteen ninety nine and we considered them to be capable of doing although the oag guidelines still call us to play by the rules so yeah yeah any other you 've asked a question that answerers as it was really to do with the time frame yeah and the raj guidelines our guidelines anyway I 'm ref and there 's oh you 're not ref you were yani info they look the same I just I just had a question probably some of the terms too broad and I mean we had a very specific request we their number of recommendations that the deputation made so I just wanted to hear a kind of staff response to some of those points of concern so and then I wanted to be more explicit around be whether we could actually specify the coastal residents group because it seems to me the affected communities are very broad I mean you 've got people normally ballston that are affected and I don 't quite know how you 'd give a pic to to working out who you actually in go to us and given that we already had a process to engage and for whatever reason that hasn 't been very successful because it that we need to be more explicit so there 's a direct question on Bay and then a question around secular concerns that were expressed around the criticism of the target and how to report what the staff response to those yeah I don 't know that staff can answer that question I mean that that it 's deliberately broad because there are a number I think as I 've mentioned before when we were in a corolla akaroa want us to be providing them with some good quality information in this area so and words i would definitely change the word could to be would oh sorry I 'm just saluting but the details of which will be determined after consultation with affected communities it 's it 's deliberately left loose it 's just not a requirement to do everyone it 's a requirement to consider who 's affected so it is deliberately board but it 's not about it 's just not about preferring one group over another it 's just about recognizing that there 's a range of people who 've been affected by this and it 's too it 's a it 's a discussion it 's a sortation about it or not just sorry let me just be really clear so why understand TV is that that 's the choice of it oh we use to do the peer review well no it may not be just about who does the peer review it might be some elements of the I just I just think that it 's it 's deliberately broad just to enable people to to have a genuine consultation I mean like one of the one of the comments that i read recently was that people didn 't you know want to didn 't want me were officials for examples and and other technical advisors on sea level rise to the parliamentary commissioner for the environment but they 're also the technical advisors to the ministry for the environment well why wouldn 't you want to have a consideration of at least having someone from from the technical advisors to the government we 're going to be providing nationwide guidelines I 'm not debating who were here but that 's why I don 't want to have the debate here I want to have an open discussion and allow our staff to work with affected communities it can be broad there 's no reason to prefer one group over another because if you list one and leave out another then they 're going to feel aggrieved I 'd much rather leave it up to a more open that consultation will be done and when we will be in a position to identify who will be doing that work can I just get a time frame for Bay in terms of when we would make a decision on who would do that review with you league I would quite like to an urgent peer review they had to be conducted I certainly don 't want to see this linger for six months 12 minutes whatever say and why my intention and that amendment was to get the peer review done in a manner that was acceptable to the affected communities and that their peer review be conducted as quickly as possible perhaps that part of its not reflected the amendment at the moment maybe a peer review be conducted as soon as possible boy yep as soon as possible and then there 's in the response to the the concerns that were raised about the TMT report I think that 's men mir that 's an issue for the peer review is not the starter debate that here and now Phil and then come thank you for the of flooding and the list i 'm referring to part 55 and 56 in your report and perhaps that you can explain to us and the meaning of for example of a flood in a hundred year event or 150 year event and then the levels that might be expected to arise one of the one of the issues that the parliamentary commission of the environment report addressed was the change in the frequency of serious flooding events as a result of climate change and sea level rise and that 's not something that we have explicitly addressed either in the tonkin and taylor report or in in the dilemma comments and that does lead to some of us understanding because the scale of these events and the frequency of these events will change over time and one of the examples that doctor writes goes in her report is modeling of the frequency of today 's 100-year event so if you at a picnic table in agoura on the shoreline and this picnic table if today 's 100-year event came up to the level of that picnic table that is a reserve and a corral but what what the technical information is telling us that with 30 centimeters of sea level rise you 'd expect a store event that would reach that picnic table to be happening every year so not 90 100 years but every year you 'd be getting flooding up to the up to the top of this picnic table and with one meter of sea level rise it would be happening on every tide so that gives an indication of how the the scale of storm event flooding is reaching further and further inland with the rising sea levels thanks Helen my other question is perhaps crew just like to be the reports but being criticized around the using a broad method approach could you perhaps also tell us about just explain to us about the other methods of of that are contained a report and i 'm referring like this to the the lighter information and how in fact that their work you 're getting into some technical detail here that that i 'm not confident to to explain without some notes unfortunately i 'm of things the other the the broom rule is one of the one of the matters their parliamentary commission of the environment and her report mentions in terms of the uncertainty that the degree of uncertainty that brings into the assessment of sea level rise and then resulting coastal erosion i 'm sickly on open coasts so the Brawn wall has been used for the open coast work but it is not used for the enclosed histories so we are we are the where the coastal erosion zones are met for example along the new brighton spurt the Brawn will rule is used to determine the coastal erosion zones on the open coast side but it is not used to determine the coastal erosion zones on the easter e side there 's a there 's a there 's two other techniques that are used to model and determine we are those stones foot just to clarify just to clarify be when you are reviewing a technical document it must be based that review peer review will be based on scientific fact but what I 'm reading and being Dave correct are and I went out with tender see city has erie it was citrus out apart from the pair of you being based on scientific effect which you would hope it would be there would be with consultation with interest groups whether they be on the coast or lower head get even or the Easter etc that there would be a lens put over those particular areas of concern for those communities is that what we 're kind of looking at because I would say that that would be the logical way to go I 'll take those they use all right okay well I 'm so um David you 'd like to move this if I could just make like if I could just make one comment in terms of the peer review being conducted as soon as possible but I understand this as a matter of urgency but I would not like to see the suffer the same fate as some of the work under the district plan in terms of being fast-tracked inexpensive quality yeah so I 'm quite happy to to take on board urgency yeah the right people available and it may be that we identify a panel and then people are not available and we need to do some more work to identify others rather than sell ourselves short on that should we put as soon as practicable rather than as soon as possible yeah I because I 'd be perfectly happy with it then it it indicates the sense of urgency but but I mean I agree we don 't want to come back here and be having another argument about whether the peer review of the peer review of the peer reviewed with executives we want to see this well yeah you have to do it well yeah we do we do alright so so let 's moved by David and sickened up by glean so right is there any discussion yeah neat I think thank you for this report i think is really important that we do acknowledge the concern that has been expressed and we do need to take action Andrew _"

Edwards dismissed mr. Arnold 's report on the basis that was pro bono which respectfully CI CCA you doesn 't believe is relevant CC ru has also been made aware of disquiet amongst council staff over the tonkin and taylor report we came here today with the intention of supporting councilor East notice of motion to ascend the acceptance of the tonkin and taylor report however that very late inclusion of the supplementary paper and the parliamentary commissioner for the environment report has changed that we would support and principal a further peer review of the tonkin entire report subject to the recommendations set out below however we still believe there are sound reasons to remove the tonkin and taylor report and any references to it and the resultant limb notices the supplementary report on the pce report advises the reporters of a low significance in terms of funding and impact on the community CCA you would strongly argue that the coastal hazard issue is significant it has massive impacts on those people and hazard zones that impacts the lives of people by in many age where they have no ability to adapt most people only own one property in their lives and anything affecting its value can have catastrophic consequences the coastal hazard policy affected 18,000 properties which is around 47,000 people close to thirteen percent of the city 's population there is no way that anything to do with coastal hazards can be referred to as and significant once the new district plan is in place a new process will start on a coastal hazard policy this will be challengeable unlike the previous proposal it is therefore important that the develops development of policy starts with major community consultation on the process to be followed there has been widespread acceptance of dr. Wright 's recommendations and with some better guidance from government we have the chance for a policy that may not necessarily be welcomed by all but hopefully can be accepted if the report is found to contain inaccuracies and emissions as described in the Arnold report will it be rejected in all references and limb notices emanating from the report be removed from individual properties what is the time frame for politics forget personalities that 's not about winning or losing it 's about doing what 's right cci you was formed with the goal of challenging the coastal heads of policy however we haven 't taken a position on the science the climate change cci you would expect the new policy to be based on sound science with mitigation where possible and compensation discussed the parliamentary commissioner for the environment and her report is recommending the government and local government work together to develop an aggrieved scientific based framework that will allow the Christchurch City Council to carefully work with the residents to find an acceptable solution the staff recommendation has set out here is essentially a modified version of the council 's previous controversial truncated go it alone policy to deal with the effects of climate change the government recognized that the gold alone policy was not a success the metal is wired has substantially changed the process the council was to use the environment Commissioner has recommended that would start carefully and with great consideration on a process for a national framework that would allow conditions to be to more controversy will follow the environment commissioners advice for a national conversation with the development of framework that allows the council to partner with central government we can work on a careful considered manner and achieve a consensus for a framework and process that is rigorously scientifically based in acceptable to our city 's residents with us in mind we do not believe the proposed staff recommendations before you are appropriate given the government 's recent recent actions and the environment commissioners report and ask that you consider the following one the council received the parliamentary commissioner for the environments report preparing for New Zealand for rising seas certainty and uncertainty the council provisionally subject to a staff report the doctor parliamentary commissioner the environments report preparing new zealand for rising seas certainty and uncertainty the council also include an any of the above work the effects of changes to the floodplains due to the effects of climate change the Christchurch City Council formally submit to the government that had adopt the parliamentary commission of the environments report preparing new zealand for rising seas certainty and uncertainty and that local authorities to prepare appropriate legislation national policy statements and policy etc to action the recommended course of that action outlined and the report the council work with other tles and the environment commissioner to ensure that any proposed legislation national policy statements policy recommendations etc to ensure that Christchurch City Council can work with residents to successfully resolve the problems that face the city in the next hundred years and beyond the council direct staff to reword the wording on limb is to reflect the council 's actions as adopted by the dub of recommendations the council recognized the tonkin and taylor report was not meant to be directly used as a basis for RMA district plan review or policy but that it may be useful after rigorous peer-review in public consultation to inform the council and its submissions and activities and dealing with the government and the council invite CCI you to nominate two other experts to be part of the peer review team ccie legal advisers have input into the terms of reference for any such review and we would expect that any consultants would acknowledge any be taken into account before any engagements are confirmed just one final comment and the council staff recommendations on this report there 's no reference anywhere to community consultation and I respectfully suggest that that lack of consultation has been the reason why we 're here today thank you for your time thank you very much taken about 30 seconds yeah we 're say yeah or an issue an issue I mean we 're going to go straight onto the paper after the store would you like to say something too I 'm just saying that it 's been a huge effect for the people on the East I 'm on the ground level and grassroots and might say it 's it 's called so much uncertainty in people 's lives in the east I get continual phone calls from people who around them consent problems particularly in new and new builds on blank sections it seems to be like a big stalling affect people lose interest some people who go to rebuild their houses see all this ahead of them and just say it 's too hard or take people it normally would have perhaps built their house rebuilt the house and stay there so you 're breaking up a community with these rules one other thing I will touch base on to a lot of houses and the East ticket in south shore south brighton that are going up to 100,000 below juv nothing wrong with the houses because buyers come along and say it 's a huge bargaining point are you in the coastal hazards I 'm interesting your place but I 'm going to give it I 'm going to make you a silly offer we 're hearing that all the time and people don 't have much choices they want to move on so that 's that 's actually the effect of this ruling thank you thank you well we 'll we 'll move straight on to the paper now so thank you very much for all of the effort that you 've gone to it 's much appreciated right we have the _"

't_''_345.48 received any apologies declarations of interest there are none and there isn 't this is an extraordinary meeting so don 't think public participation presentation of petitions as probably know that a normal know and but but the purpose of the meeting today is the council submission on the greater Christchurch regeneration bill and I 'll just I 'll move the I 'll move the recommendation and do I have a seconder for for the motion Thank You Phil Clearwater and just by way of introduction so we 've obviously had a discussion about the the detail of the bill I think that will go straight to a debate on the bill there I know that councillors have got specific issues that they 'd like to focus on so we 'll do that during the course of the debate I 'll be a little bit more flexible than perhaps the the to kick things off briefly just to say that the purpose of today 's meeting is to talk about the council 's submission to the greater Christchurch regeneration bill and I think that that the point that i want to make and it 's it 's kind of like a the statement that 's at the beginning of it which is regeneration is not what governments do for cities it 's what cities do for themselves and i 've been giving the odd speech of late the climate change one on Saturday and a couple of others where I 've spoken about my favorite book of course which is if me has ruled the world and the the and I know everyone laughs every time I say the title of that book because they are assuming that I want to rule the world the purpose that what lies behind the book though as this understanding that that lines but I mean the boundaries between countries literally political lines on maps when it comes to things like disease when it comes to things like global terrorism when it comes to things is nothing to protect against them when you 're talking about a political line drawn on a map but when it comes to the resilience to defeat the spread of disease to spread the defeat you know to spread to defeat global you know financial crisis or global terrorism it is at the city level that resilience can be built and that 's why I 've always regarded building resilience as one of the most important things that we can be doing as a city because we can prepare ourselves we can ensure that people know how to interrelate with each other in order to protect themselves against a whole lot of things that can 't_''_556.089 be protected against from a from a government letter level and that 's why i say that regeneration is not what governments do for cities it 's what cities do for themselves the the government has introduced the greater christchurch regeneration bill in response to a call for step change for the next step in our recovery as a city we move from the immediate response and recovery phase now to a to a leadership and local making engaging the community and a process through an organization here in christchurch city called regenerate christchurch we will soon be announcing the chair of regenerate christchurch and i think that 's going to give people a real sense of confidence that the crown and the council are now working in unison and i think that that 's going to send a very powerful message to the people of Christchurch a joint agency genuinely joint I know that the bill says that the minister appoints for a certain period and the mayor appoints for a certain period but we 've agreed between us that will jointly appoint the chair of regenerate Christchurch and I think that 's going to send an incredibly powerful message so the what we are signing off on today is part 1 of the submission I should make the point that we are going to make an oral submission and when we get to item number four actually if we could add in there nominates the mayor and the chief executive to speak to the submission on behalf of the council I think the Select Committee we will be able to expand on our submission so I 'm not too worried about expanding on it but I know that some councillors want to raise some particular issues that they 'd like us to draw to the Select Committee 's attention and I encourage people to raise those now and the debate and I also believe that will have the opportunity to submit a supplementary submission at any stage even after we 've made our oral submission in order to assist that process they 're on a pretty tight timeframe they 'll be down here I think on the 10th 11th and 12th of December so that 's only at the end of next week and so that they 're going to be working quite hard to get that bill back into the house and time for it to take the place of the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Act when it expires late or late April so I will hand it over to to my colleagues to debate the bill and and I mean not the bill the submission and then we will take it submission it 's really full I think it encompasses many of the ways and processes that in fact we would like to see the whole region and closely at regeneration built in there is going to be scope for the mirror and I 'm pleased that we 're going to do this to just speak to the bill and add some points to or I guess reiterate and pointed out some examples of what 's here and one one area that I think you need to make sure happens what this chat and changing this bill is it in fact we find ways so that the regeneration plans and only owned by the government or even regenerate Christchurch but there 's ways that local groups and local people and businesses can actually formulate their local plans to and certain them as an example of where that needs to happen and I think we 're aware that enviro waste right by the railway line has created a barrier for a lot of really necessary development for local businesses and that there needs to be a way for local areas to also I think that 's where submission refers really clearly that needs to be more recognition of the role of local government and including aspects of consultation and engagement in the bill does there so I think it 's our submission as it is really good and strong it points to the need for a strong collaborative approach with central government and as the young i think in 702 what we need to happen from the spell and it to happen for christchurch now is to have some joined up solutions create creating the best regeneration for our local communities to enjoy yeah I 'm certainly supported submission was presented to us today and I 'd like in fact to commend everyone that 's been involved in getting us to this point because I think what we 've got is a very good and suitably strong submission ID note that the central city in New Brighton are specifically referenced in the bill but that doesn 't preclude the ability to add other areas Phil already mentioned signum Littleton maybe another example and there are other areas where we 've already done a regeneration plan and the bill as its presented allows for the opportunity for other areas to be added both geographically all by activity in fact as well but I believe what we 've got here is a well-crafted submission it makes the points that we need to make makes them well and it makes them suitably strongly and at the same time it makes constructive suggestions about changes we want to see so that the the step change and the transition to local governments the transitions or local decision-making is achieved in the legislation so I 'm very supportive of what we 've got in front of us today Ellie thank you I just again I think it 's an excellent submission I do wonder though whether we need to look at an amendment or include some information in this around an end point for the insurance in eq c claims i think that regeneration is more than the physical and the strong communities make for a really strong city in a healthy City and many people need an endpoint and I 'll just draw your attention to the you see on the trick program that was out yesterday the report and she actually notes that EQC says it 's exerting every effort to ensure that the remaining settlements are completed as soon as reasonably practical however EQC has not set a new in date for the program and the same could be said of ensure grunts companies and there has been some discussion about putting in dates for EQC and final settlement dates for insurance companies and legislation that would be a long time coming we have an opportunity I think to not only signal that well signal it 's strongly actually and in this bill people need to know where they stand and there are still people out there that still don 't even know whether they are over cap or under cap with eq c and while we celebrate and perhaps in the positions we r and we more than many others have an opportunity to celebrate a lot of the ones that are going on around the city around the central city and around the suburbs there are an awful lot of people who still enjoy the journey that some of us are able to enjoy once we come out the other side of ink you see an insurance and i think we need to signal that we need to advocate for our people and i think at this point 25 years on for years on people just need to know that what they are being offered what they are what is being suggested to them the next part of the journey is fair I 've seen situations where people have been offered exactly what they 've asked for endure and entitled to but are so tired and are so confused with that tightness that they reject that and I think that they need that truly independent support and advocacy in order to move on and resolve their cases so I would strongly suggest that there be something in this bill that signals to both EQC and the insurance companies we need an end date so that people can move on Paul and then gleam escape change for the city of it and it 's really good to see that we 're now going to bringing our wishes to the fall so that makes really important for me you 're there are probably a few things in regeneration that I think we may be missing and made this week we go to the factor for regeneration for me is like a piece of string how long 's over there for years could be 20 years before we see for regeneration of some areas and with that in mind you know we 've got derelict buildings no it 's not just in central city but it 's actually across the city we have other smaller business districts that actually have damaged buildings or empty sites and it 's the maintenance of those sons and making sure that we can encourage or enforce these landowners to ensure Lee they do keep their buildings that are derelict and we modern use all their ND sites that what built on in some form that actually it reflects well on the city because they said 20 years as a long time if you 've got an empty site that 's blowing dust around the city or every one of our and damage done to your building it 's in the face of their public and our visitors again it 's a good look on our cities so I think we need to take that leadership role manage your own sites and good start but also then we can actually do to others to do exactly the same man having some sort of framework or now that they have our people together with it great yeah yani I 'm sorry you 're not yani know you 're glen III seed yani and look straight at you I know that 's what it 's okay I agree with one of the main themes coming through the submission that the starting point needs to be a new thing rather than the old legislation also wonder at the use of regeneration and its association with step change I 've looked into the definition of regeneration it could be a case of be careful what you wish for because seems to me that regeneration is far more profound than stick change it actually means a new generation it means a transformation and for communities such they 'll be looking for delivery I suspect it 's probably the last roll of the dice for them we 've had several Master Cleanse as you know over the years and if this doesn 't deliver from central and local government then I 'm not sure what space the communities will be in I am concerned over communities surrounding the residual residential red zone to that consultation process over that part of the city could go on for two years they are becoming increasingly Restless in my view and I think we do need to put out some positive signs that things ahead me so right behind this I see the residential red zone is offering the potential to unite the city because I think it needs to be United after the quakes and if we can ensure together with government that we will deliver then I think it will offer people hope which is one of the biggest things they need at the moment pawling thank you for the preparation of this bill as I know there 's a huge amount of work that 's gone into this following on from council Livingston nearly the residential reads own a submitter came into the LTP and actually called it the agita bar to the yeast was one word for it but it 's a Jutta bar to a lot of regeneration as well it 's affecting our land drainage recovery program it 's affecting a lot of our plans what we might do out the year we were at a meeting last night with Brooklyn 's residents who are actually on the verge of deciding sounded life of most of the 12 or so we 're going to stay there so I 've wondering if we really need to not only try and focus on XP da ting what we decide to do with the red zone 3 regeneration Christ view but also to make sure we are considering that people who are choosing to stay to live in those red signs so there 's what I 'm just bringing out at the bill here at the moment the rest of it is fantastic it 's a great opportunity here for a new beginning has steep change in regeneration can really get this cracking siddiqui thank you realistically with regards to the wedding and other areas referred to by the council I think that really covers and looks at the varieties of communities we behave in the levels that they will need of support going to the future with regards to regeneration and regeneration Christchurch and in particular I 'm really pleased with regards to really talking with them looking at as a whole and we 've got land and government ownership whether a big government or council or other entities that we 're really looking at when these are disposed of looking at how these could support whatever erie whether it 's a suburb community or key activity areas how these can support the regeneration of the city but while still keeping in mind the legal legal obligations that we so I 'm really really pleased with this and I think it 's a really good move forward and i also want to compliment council staff for the work that they 've done stock david i thank you i will support the motion and i 'd like to amount of work that they have done for me i have a great deal of satisfaction that the residential red-zoned and you bright and well focused in this submission it 's a good focus for regenerate christchurch and these projects great to see being implemented and getting our co-operative personally I 've been through four master plans in the new brighton area I 've been through a lot of rhetoric a lot of talk and for me it 's a time for positive action and to see some material change so i 'm very bored by what I 'm seeing before me I 'd like to just acknowledge in the proposal 1 point 0 2 particularly where I think we have focused in the executive summary the actual need and desire to do this work and what the purpose is I 'm very pleased I thought I see before me and I will be Jamie yeah I think most of it 's been nothing see damn but I did want to touch on just a couple of quick points and that 's am it is really clear you know this are no longer in recovery anymore we 're past there and this is a new phase and it 's an exciting phase what we had is vehicles that that connect together to achieve certain things was possibly appropriate at the time of immediate earthquake recovery I think we were all agree that what we had is no longer the service vehicle to achieve what we need to achieve now fundamentally the only thing ever the only thing any of us either could have wanted as a result of the earthquake happening most we couldn 't knock a few wake occurring you go look at it and say we need to be a better City a more resilient City and more vibrant city a safer City then what we ever could have been had that earth quite not happened it 's the only thing that makes this all worthwhile it 's the only thing that shows any respect to the people that were injured have lost their lives are weaned through the most hellish time imaginable and I look around christchurch right now and I really believe that as we look 're on the path to do that I really believe that we are going to be a better city as a result of that is quite whether it 's just a cool piece of art with you see the different people that you never really saw so much an old christchurch the new buildings are up there think even the cafe 's that you see it really does give me hope that we 're going to be in a better City than what christ church ever could have been hadith quite hadn 't have happened and regenerate christ which i think is a really great vehicle to be able to take this to the next step it is a true partnership in every sense of the word of crown and local government we can 't do it without the crown and the crown can 't_''_1636.74 do without us so i 'm looking forward to this next phase and I most certainly endorse the submission and I congratulate everyone that worked on it and I look forward to our to our new exciting time in Christ Jimmy I also support at convince me especially the male lungs the earlier regeneration is not fat Hermann 24 cities is facilities to themselves because I always thought you know this kind of the regeneration receipt is neither from the top down HR is the parking lot and also the also the regeneration issue in High Church in suburban area as the olin tations running in valentin you know Safari depressed because we 're much premier wistar our issue how to rebuild a situa secondaries is the kind of a summation recovers not only in a cpt only actually survived my fellow councillor particularly new bride and Sinden or even or some other race on the area so there is a whole city to pay the tribute didn 't regenerate third one is a face on this commission with covers the light whoa give the local no more getting involved more a kind of a local can make the decisions is also pectoral that is the power to the local I think this baby whether the crucial and only the one because why the a moment is kind of regenerate friends you know Nigel a the hostile relations for enslaved relation between at least TCO in relation to the canto still kind of great area need to be identified but I think if one studies that we generated fear has been a profiler a garmin only tech times more clarified if a council on length or punk on the name by how to do you know to identify more clearly and also RC and a DC or in a phone call how to you know what together for planning for imitation or how to facilitate means the teacher need to take time to be a flavor so but generally speaking as a holy son issue thank you anyone else Yanni thank you for the opportunity safety words I think one of the things I just want to start off with a quote from George Santayana who quoted in the and the life of Reason 1905 those who knocked in room it those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it and I think we need to learn from where we 've come from to find a way forward I think it 's really 're in the situation we 're in today and what a better approach will be going forward in it there 's with a bit of irony that the submission process last time was completely anti-democratic counselors were kept in the dark and this time we actually had a much more open transparent process around formulating a submission actually having time to prepare considered submission to a select committee which is certainly not the opportunity that we were given previously and there 's a bit of an irony because in that submission that I made in a personal capacity I asked if we could actually a point fifty percent of the community forum and that the government changed the wood consultation with council to partnership and isn 't it an irony that actually what we 're talking about here was the slight edition of one Rick from rota as a joint 50-50 appointment to the regeneration crushers forth so it 's interesting to reflect on the ideas that would put forward at the time dismissed but actually where we 've got to now you have ahead of your time I do bill and the success of the regeneration will be in its democracy so we 're moving from an autocracy to a to a democracy and what we don 't want to do is create more bureaucracy that gets in the middle and I think the success of people having confidence and certainty in this process and in these boards that will be established through here and the powers that we can food actually that they feel that they 're involved and engaged and the decisions that have been made and it 's worth that I raised the issue of the residents in the central setting the residents who live within the four hours and who actually have been subject to pretty awkward and confusing planning over the last five years and you just reflect on the number of submissions that residents made the percentage of people that asked for things like urban design notification to be involved when things affected their properties for special amenity areas to be retained and restored and enhanced and that that was dismissed despite over ninety percent of the people that made submissions saying that inner city and it doesn 't it does seem to me that the council has a map of the central city which defines the community board delegated authority area which includes the CBD and goes a little bit to the south to Morehouse and it does seem to me that we should consider that actually that should be the central setting or the regeneration not the entire for abs which disenfranchises a huge number of residents from normal democratic decision-making I think those reasons have been through four different planning exercises a bit like my colleague council a stew made reference to New Brighton and I think it 's fair to say that the outcome of those planning processes has not reflected the majority desires of those communities therefore I can see no good reason to keep them within this planning context I think it 's better that they actually we think about a return to New Democracy I think we also need to think about a few other aspects to this legislation and I guess if you look at it and the broadest context efforts around empowering us to do things and the extraordinary circumstances that we 're faced was then that 's a really good principle so it 's not about someone telling us what we have to do it 's actually about us being able to say we need help and here 's a way in which we can we can achieve it and can you work with us to actually find a solution to doing something it 's also about looking at things like public transport we as a city should be in control of public transport the fact that we have a competitive environment for a public transport and a post-earthquake environment as bizarre and so we 've got an opportunity to in this legislation to do a lot more than just planning for physical built form but actually planning for social services planning for housing planning for transport all key things and services that make up a city and help the community and I think there is an opportunity to really gestation if we work with it to actually get some of those things happening I do also make the point that you know for vacant properties or derelict properties properties that have been you know left at the whim of projected insurance negotiations or for whatever reasons haven 't_''_2094.44 been up kit and I think there is a kind of issue here that actually we knew we do need to start saying to government that you have to you have to have some legislative thought governed two requirements on insurance companies to settle and a timely manner to deal with people in good faith and not allow them to just have this open-ended process and I guess councils a very good example of someone who despite being nearly five years on from the disaster we 're still to resolve our insurance issues in any substantial way so I think there 's an opportunity through this legislation I 've got some concerns about some of the aspects to it I think that 's going to be addressed through the delegated authority to the other we 've committed to address I think we do need to get some clarity around what 's happening without district wedding and I 'm still not quite sure where things me the last thing we want to do is create another separate district planning process away from local decision-making and the final point I 'll make is that we can 't forget about the ability to have actually surgeon see what projects are going to be delivered by hope and how they 're going to be paid for and the one reflection that I leave you is that F we 'd sort it out at the start of the process who was responsible for making decisions on things like the central city projects and how they would be funded before they were announced I think we 'd see a lot more progress today rather than the situation we 're under which has come under recently thank you thank you very much um I think that 's been a really good debate and I think it 's been incredibly helpful to have people focusing on what as an incredibly important moment I think in the history of the city I totally agree with the the warning about looking to what 's happened in the past in order to see the way I remember in the past was you 've got to keep your eye on the rear vision mirror in order to see your way clear on the road ahead and I think that 's about right for the for the frame I think the fact that we are debating and public the submission that we 're going to make on the bill the fact that the mirror and the chief executive will front up to the Select Committee side by side that didn 't happen last time either this is going to be I think quite a different occasion it 's an opportunity for us to really stretch ourselves and to say to central government that we 're ready to take up a role that we weren 't ready to take up five years ago and the fact that we weren 't ready five years ago that 's neither here nor there we 're ready now and we 've said very clearly to central government we can play an equal role we can stand alongside you and I loved it i think jamie was the one who said they can them but they can 't do it without us and it 's actually the collaboration between central government the council but also the through its various communities the business community through the different communities that each one of you represents around this table and represents really well so and all of those issues about the different communities that are interested in the central city but are also interested in the areas where they live that came through really loud and clear a message that did come through for me and it has been bothering me for a long time as well as the fact that people can 't really they can 't really move on with their own lives until their insurance are settled not all the derelict buildings are a result of insurance companies either there are obviously negotiations going on between different parties and you know I do think though that the points that both yani and Paul have raised about the need to get on top of the derelict buildings is really important because I think they send a really negative message about our city and its be something and we 'll certainly raise that when we make their oral submission on the Select Committee I 'm thinking that perhaps a an amendment on the face of the record and relation to the in relation to the to the insurance though for the residential area I think probably would be incredibly helpful and helpfully someone 's drafted some words here along the lines of recognizing that an old hand them over recognizing that the lack of certainty regarding insurance outcomes remains a significant obstacle to regeneration for individuals and communities the council asks the crown to consider introducing a legislative mechanism that would require both public eqc and private insurers to reach a greed timeframes for settlement with all outstanding claimants and make available advocacy and technical support and mediation services to enable this to occur informally I have raised the idea of having a cut-off point for mediation to occur that 's not arbitration it 's not forcing people into final positions but it 's mediation and often mediation will enable people to see what the issues are some of the people I 've spoken to whether the deals a fair deal or not and they 've just that the trust has broken down so much that they just can 't trust what they 're being told they need someone under pendant someone on their side to say this is an ok deal or it 's not an ok deal and here 's why so if we could add that to the submission I mean the feedback that I 've had from insurance companies that I 've spoken to on a very informal basis is that they would be interested in that approach and I think that I think everyone would like to bring this part of it to an end because it is stopping people from engaging in the next phase the regeneration phase of the city and if people were able to get that certainty and to have that resolution even if they could have a timeline so that they would know when things were going to get done then that would give people the ability to get excited about the next phase and the life of the city and there is a next counselors who said this is the symbolizes a new beginning I can 't remember whether it was Ali or Pauline but it was one of them and it doesn 't matter because I always get them confused anyway but the point that I 'm making is that it 's a wonderful opportunity and and we have to step up ourselves it 's not just a step change that 's coming you know from some someone else it 's us that has to step up and be part of that step change I 'm so excited about the opportunity that regenerate crow does give us i personally do think that it could be a model for a new way of doing urban urban planning and the urban sense it 's not the idea that it engages communities and in a meaningful exchange and that 's to and fro and i think that 's what 's been missing to a large extent as that sense of to and fro this certainly happened over Victoria Square and I think that 's been a hugely positive result it 's been a real 11 it the ccd you proposals that were initially going out the engagement with the community has actually enabled a really good result and I think that that is a really good model for how our city will will develop from here on and so thank you very much for for the input and I too would like to put on record my thanks to council staff who have made such a significant contribution and I know put on such a large amount of effort and her and to making this work so on that basis with the addition of these words and mediation services to occur also right excellent and we can tidy up the grammar afterwards so i will put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's Carrie thank you very much right and on that note I oh can I can I have a mover and a seconder for an apology from councillor back which did come through on the end and I think that was just late coming through term and Phil I 'll put that motion all those in favor I will declare the meeting closed thank you very much you _"

    "text": "and I 'd like to call for apologies I haven 't received one from cancer the buck but I wonder if she 's perhaps not here I haven 't seen here this morning but I haven 't_''_12.48 received any apologies declarations of interest there are none and there isn 't this is an extraordinary meeting so don 't think public participation presentation of petitions as probably know that a normal know and but but the purpose of the meeting today is the council submission on the greater Christchurch regeneration bill and I 'll just I 'll move the I 'll move the recommendation and do I have a seconder for for the motion Thank You Phil Clearwater and just by way of introduction so we 've obviously had a discussion about the the detail of the bill I think that will go straight to a debate on the bill there I know that councillors have got specific issues that they 'd like to focus on so we 'll do that during the course of the debate I 'll be a little bit more flexible than perhaps the the three-minute rule things off briefly just to say that the purpose of today 's meeting is to talk about the council 's submission to the greater Christchurch regeneration bill and I think that that the point that i want to make and it 's it 's kind of like a the statement that 's at the beginning of it which is regeneration is not what governments do for cities it 's what cities do for themselves and i 've been giving the odd speech of late the climate change one on saturday and a couple of others where I 've spoken about my favorite book of course which is if me has ruled the world and the the and I know everyone laughs every time I say the title of that book because they 're assuming that I want to rule the world the purpose that what lies behind the book though as this understanding that that lines but I mean the boundaries between countries literally political lines on maps when it comes to things like disease when it comes to things like global terrorism when it comes to things like the to protect against them when you 're talking about a political line drawn on a map but when it comes to the resilience to defeat the spread of disease to spread that of the you know to spread to defeat global you know financial crisis or global terrorism it is that the city level that resilience can be built and that 's why I 've always regarded building resilience as one of the most important things that we can be doing as a city because we can prepare ourselves we can ensure that people know how to interrelate with each other in order to protect themselves against a whole lot of things that can 't_''_223.09 be protected against from a from a government letter level and that 's why i say that regeneration is not what governments do for cities it 's what cities do for themselves the the government has introduced the greater christchurch regeneration bill in response to a call for a step change for the next step in our recovery as a city we move from the immediate response and recovery phase now to a to a leadership and local decision-making engaging the community and a process through an organization here in christchurch city called regenerate christchurch we will soon be announcing the chair of regenerate christchurch and i think that 's going to give people a real sense of confidence that the crown and the council are now working in unison and i think that that 's going to send a very powerful message to the people of Christchurch a joint agency genuinely joint I know that the bill says that the minister appoints for a certain period and the mayor appoints for a certain period but we 've agreed between us that will jointly appoint the chair of regenerate Christchurch and I think that 's going to send an incredibly powerful message so the what we are signing off on today is part 1 of the submission I should make the point that we are going to make an oral submission and when we get to item number four actually if we could add in there nominates the mayor and the chief executive to speak to the submission on behalf of the council I think the Select Committee we will be able to expand on our submission so I 'm not too worried about expanding on it but I know that some councillors want to raise some particular issues that they 'd like us to draw to the Select Committee 's attention and I encourage people to raise those now and the debate and I also believe that will have the opportunity to submit a supplementary submission at any stage even after we 've made our oral submission in order to assist that process there are on a pretty tight timeframe they 'll be down here I think on the 10th 11th and 12th of December so that 's only at the end of next week and so that they 're going to be working quite hard to get that bill back into the house and time for it to take the place of the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Act when it expires and late late April so I will hand it over to to my colleagues to debate the bill and and I mean not the bill the submission and then we will take it an excellent submission it 's really full I think it encompasses many of the ways and processes that in fact we would like to see the whole region and Christchurch regeneration bill and there is going to be scope for the mirror and I 'm pleased that we 're going to do this to just speak to the bill and add some points to or I guess reiterate and point out some examples of what 's here and one one area that I think we need to make sure happens what this chattin changing this bill is in fact we find ways so that the regeneration plans and only owned by the government or even regenerate Christchurch but there 's ways that local groups and local people and businesses can actually formulate their local plans to and setting them as an example of where that needs to happen and I think we 're aware that enviro waste right by the railway line has created a barrier for a lot of really necessary development for local businesses and it 's there needs to be a way for local areas to also I think that 's where our submission refers really clearly that needs to be more recognition of the role of local government and including aspects of consultation and engagement in and the bill does there so I think it 's our submission as it is really good and strong it points to the need for a strong collaborative approach with central government and as the i think in 70 to what we need to happen from the spell and to happen christchurch nail just have some joined up solutions create creating the best regeneration for our local communities to enjoy i 'm certainly supporting some mission was presented to us today and I 'd like in fact to commend everyone that 's been involved in getting us to this point because I think what we 've got is a very good and suitably strong submission ID note that the central city in New Brighton and specifically referenced in the bill but that doesn 't preclude the ability to add other areas feel already mentioned signum littleton maybe another example and there are other areas where we 've already done some regeneration plan and the bill as its presented allows for the opportunity for other areas to be added both geographically or by activity in facts as well but I believe what we 've got here is a well-crafted submission it makes the points that we need to make makes them well and it makes them suitably strongly and at the same time it makes constructive suggestions about changes we want to see so that the the step change and the transition to local governments the transitions or local decision-making is achieved in the legislation so I 'm very supportive of what we 've got in front of us today Ellie thank you I just again I think it 's an excellent submission I do wonder though whether we need to look at an amendment or include some information in this around an end point for the insurance in eq c claims i think that regeneration is more than the physical and the strong communities make for a really strong city in a healthy City and many people need an endpoint and I 'll just draw your attention to the officer see on the trick program that was out yesterday the report and she actually notes that EQC says it 's exerting every effort to ensure that the remaining settlements are completed as soon as reasonably practical however EQC has not seen it a new in date for the program and the same could be said of insurance companies and there has been some discussion about putting in dates for EQC and final settlement dates for insurance companies and legislation that would be a long time coming we have an opportunity I think to not only signal that well signal it 's strongly actually and in this bill people need to know where they stand and there are still people out there that still don 't even know whether they are over cap or under cap with eq c and while we celebrate and perhaps and the positions we r and we more than many others have an opportunity to celebrate a lot of the ones that are going on around the city around the central city and around the suburbs there are an awful lot of people who still don the journey that some of us are able to enjoy once we come out the other side of ink you see an insurance and i think we need to signal that we need to advocate for our people and i think at this point 25 years on for years on people just need to know that what they are being offered what they are what is being suggested to them the next part of the journey is fair I 've seen situations where people have been offered exactly what they 've asked for under entitled to but are so tired and are so confused with that tightness that they reject that and I think that they need that truly independent support and advocacy in order to move on and resolve their cases so i would strongly suggest that there be something in this bill that signals to both EQC and the insurance companies we need an in date so that people can move on paul and then Glenn change for the city of it and it 's really good to see that we 're now going to be working in to the fall so that makes really important for me you 're out there are probably a few things in regeneration that I think may be missing and may destroy people to the factor for regeneration for me is like a piece of string how long 's over the years it could be 20 years before we see for regeneration or some areas and with that in mind you know we 've got derelict buildings and that 's not just in Central City but it 's actually across the city we have other smaller business districts that actually have damaged buildings or EMP sites and it 's the maintenance of those signs and making sure that we can encourage or enforce these land and property owners to ensure Lee they do keep their buildings that are derelict and modern use all their ND sites that a lot built on in some form that actually it reflects well on the city because I said 20 years as a long time I figured an empty site that 's blowing dust around the city or every one of the suburban areas that 's your building it 's in the face of their public and our visitors again it 's a good look on our cities so I think we need to take that leadership role and manage your own sites and good stuff and we lose some but also then we can actually do great yeah Yanni I 'm sorry you 're not yani know you 're Glenn i seed Yanni and look straight at you I know lost foot it 's ok I agree with one of the main themes coming through the submission that the starting point needs to be a new thing rather than the old legislation also wonder at the use of regeneration and its association with step change I 've looked into the definition of regeneration it could be a case of be careful what you wish for because seems to me that regeneration is far more profound than stick change it actually means a new generation it means a transformation and for communities such as New Brighton they will be looking for hope and they 'll be looking for delivery I suspect it 's probably the last Master Cleanse as you know over the years and if this doesn 't deliver from central and local government then I 'm not sure what space the communities will be in I am concerned over communities surrounding the residuary residential red zone to that consultation process over that part of the city could go on for two years they are becoming increasingly Restless in my view and I think we do need to put out some positive signs that things are happening so right behind this I see the residential red zone is offering the potential to unite the city because I think it needs to be United after the quakes and if we can ensure together with government that we will deliver then I think it will offer people hope which is one of the biggest things they need at the moment pulling thank you for the preparation of this bill as I know there 's a huge amount of work that 's gone into this it 's a very challenging issue here I 'm just following on from cancer Livingston nearly the residential reit zone a submitter came bar to the yeast was one word for it but it 's a Jutta bar to a lot of regeneration as well it 's affecting our land drainage recovery program it 's affecting a lot of our plans what we might do out the year we were at a meeting last night with Brooklyn 's residents who are actually on the verge of deciding that sounded like of most of the 12 or so we 're going to stay there so I 've wondering if we really need to not only try and focus on XP da ting what we decide to do with the red zone 3 regeneration Christ you but also to make sure we are considering the people who are choosing to stay to live in those red signs so there 's what I 'm just bringing out of the bill here at the moment the rest of it is fantastic it 's a great opportunity here for a new beginning a step change in regeneration as such a lively word let 's hope that we can really get this cracking so dinky thinking realistically with regards council I think that really covers and looks at the varieties of communities we behave in the levels that they will need of support going to the future of regards to regeneration and the regeneration Christchurch and in particular I 'm really pleased with regards to when we 're talking with them looking at as a whole we 've got land and government ownership whether it big government or council or other entities that we 're really looking at when these are disposed of looking at how these could support whatever eerie weather exam suburb community or key activity areas how these can support the regeneration of the city but while still keeping in mind the legal legal obligations that we around us so I 'm really really pleased with this and I think it 's a really good move forward and i also want to compliment council staff for the work that they 've done this doctrine David I thank you i will support the motion and i 'd like to particularly acknowledge the authors of the submission for the great amount of work that they 've done for residential red-zoned and you bright and well focused and this submission it 's a good focus for regenerate christchurch and these projects are great to see being implemented and getting our co-operative personally I 've been through four master plans in the new brighton area I 've been through a lot of rhetoric a lot of talk and for me it 's a time for positive action and to see some material change so I 'm very buoyed by what I 'm seeing before me I 'd like to just acknowledge in the proposal 1 point 0 2 particularly where I think we have focused in the executive summary the actual need and desire to do this work and what the purpose is I 'm very pleased with what I see before me and I will be voting for Jamie yeah I think most of its being things see them but I did want to touch on just a couple of quick points and that 's am it is really clear you know this name regeneration because I think captures it so well we are no longer in recovery anymore and it 's an exciting phase what we had is vehicles that that connected together to achieve certain things was possibly appropriate at the time of immediate earthquake recovery I think we were all agreed that what we had is no longer the service vehicle to achieve what we need to achieve now fundamentally the only thing you were the only thing any of us ever could have wanted as a result of the earthquake happening most we could knock a few if quake occurring you gotta look at it and say we need to be a better City a more resilient City and more vibrant city a safer City then what we ever could have been had that earth quite not happened it 's the only thing that makes this all worthwhile it 's the only thing that shows any respect to the people that were injured or lost their lives will win through the most hellish time imaginable and I look around christchurch right now and I really believe that as we look at the end of 2015 and going into 2016 that we 're on the path to be a better city as a result of that is quite whether it 's just a cool piece of art with you see the different people that you never really saw so much an old christchurch the new buildings are up there kick even the cafe 's that you see it really does give me hope that we 're going to be in a better City than what christ church ever could have been heavy earthquake hadn 't have happened and regenerate christ which i think is a really great vehicle to be able to take this to the next step it is a true partnership and every since the word of crown and local government we can 't do it without the crown the crown can 't_''_1303.65 do without us so i 'm looking forward to this next phase and I most certainly endorse the submission and I congratulate around that worked on it and i look forward to her to our new exciting time in christchurch Jimmy I also support early summation from the council because of this paper convinced me especially the mayor who longs the to themselves because I always thought no this kind of the regeneration receipt is neither from the top down per hr is the parking lot and also the also the regeneration issue in a church in suburban area as the old patients rather than in balint and you know safar winner press because we 're much premier our issue how to review etc secondaries is the kind of the summation recovers not only in a city the only actually spider my fellow councillor particularly new crate and Sinden or even as a mother raised on the area so there is a whole city to be the tribute didn 't regenerate third one is at present least a mission with covers the light wall give the local no more getting involved more a kind of a local can make the decision systems of actual this the power to the local I think this baby whether the crucial and only the one because why the a moment of this kind of regenerative friends you know Nigel approve either our common so regarding to the kind of the hostile relations for insulated relation weight area need to be identified but I think if one studies the regenerated beer has been a co-pilot are a common only ten times more clear fine if a council on length or punk on the name by how to learn you know to identify more clearly and also our c and d co hong kong how to you know work together for planning for implementation or how to facilitate means the teacher need to take time to be a flavor so but generally speaking as a holy some issue thank you you know yawning figure to the opportunity safety words I think one of the things I just want to start off with a quote from George Santayana who quoted in the and the life of Reason 1905 those who not can remit those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it and I think we need to learn from where we 've come from to find a way forward I think it 's really important that we think about the context of why we 're in the situation we 're in today and what a a bit of irony that the submission process last time was completely anti-democratic counselors were kept in the dark and this time we 're actually had a much more open transparent process around formulating a submission actually having time to prepare and considered submission to a select committee which is certainly not the opportunity that we were given previously and there 's a bit of an irony because in that submission that i made in the personal capacity i asked if we could actually a point fifty percent of the community forum and that the government changed the word consultation with council to partnership and isn 't a an irony there actually what we 're talking about here with the slight edition of one Rick from my toffee as a joint 5050 appointment to the regeneration crush board so it 's interesting to reflect on the ideas that would put forward at the time dismissed but actually where we 've got to know you have ahead of your time I do for them to also reflect that the success of this bill and the success of the regeneration will be to a to a democracy and what we don 't want to do is create more bureaucracy that gets in the middle and I think the success of people having confidence and certainty in this process and in these boards that will be established through here and the powers that will be conferred actually that they feel that they 're involved and engaged and the decisions that have been made and it 's worth that I raised the issue of the residents in the central setting the residents who live within the four hours and who actually have been subject to pretty awkward and confusing planning over the last five years and you just reflect on the number of submissions that residents made the percentage of people that asked for things like urban design notification to be involved when things affected their properties for special amenity areas to be retained and restored and enhanced and that that was dismissed despite over ninety percent of the people that made submissions saying that that was something that they wanted in terms of the inner city and it doesn 't it does seem central study which defines the community board delegated authority area which includes the CBD and goes a little bit to the south to Morehouse and it does seem to me that we should consider that actually that should be the central setting or the regeneration not the entire for ads which disenfranchises a huge number of residents from normal democratic decision-making I think those reasons have been through four different planning exercises about that point my colleague council days to made reference to new writing and I think it 's fair to say that the outcome of those planning processes has not reflected the majority desires of those communities therefore I can see no good reason to keep them within this planning context I think it 's better that they actually we think about a return to normal democracy I think we also need to think about a few other aspects to this legislation and I guess after you look at it and the broadest context efforts around empowering us to be able to ask for the help we need to do things and the extraordinary circumstances that we 're it 's not about someone telling us what we have to do it 's actually about us being able to say we need help and here 's a way in which we think we can achieve it and can you work with us to actually find a solution to doing something it 's also about looking at things like public transport we as a city should be in control of public transport the fact that we have a competitive environment for a public transport and oppose quite environment as as bizarre and so we 've got an opportunity to this legislation to do a lot more than just planning for physical built form but actually planning for social services planning for housing planning for transport all key things and services that make up a city and help for community and I think there is an opportunity to really gestation if we work with it to actually get some of those things happening I do also make the point that you know I 've asked our staff to look at a bylaw for vacant properties or derelict properties properties that have negotiations or for whatever reasons heaven thing up kit and I think there is a kind of issue here that actually we knew we do need to start saying to government that you have to you have to have some legislative thought govern to requirements on insurance companies to settle and a timely manner to deal with people in good faith and not allow them to just have this open-ended process and I guess councils a very good example of someone who despite being nearly five years on from the disaster we 're still to resolve our insurance issues in any substantial way so I think there 's an opportunity through this legislation I 've got some concerns about some of the aspects to it I think that 's going to be addressed through that delegated authority to the other committed to address I think we do need to get some clarity around what 's happening without district wedding and I 'm still not quite sure where things have got to of that but it does seem to me the last thing we want to do is create another separate point I 'll make is that we can 't forget about the ability to have extras urgency around what projects are going to be delivered by hope and how they 're going to be paid for and the one reflection leave you as that F word sorted out at the start of the process who was responsible for making decisions on things like the central city projects and how they would be funded before they were announced I think we 'd see a lot more progress today rather than the situation we run which has come only recently thank you thank you very much um I think that 's been a really good debate and I think it 's been incredibly helpful to have people focusing on what as an incredibly important moment I think in the history of the city I totally agree with the the warning about looking to what 's happened in the past in order to see the way ahead the way that I had it described to me I remember in the past was you 've got to keep your eye on the rear vision road ahead and I think that 's about right for the for the frame I think the fact that we are debating and public the submission that we 're going to make on the bill the fact that the mayor and the chief executive will front up to the Select Committee side by side that didn 't happen last time either this is going to be I think quite a different occasion it 's an opportunity for us to really stretch ourselves and to say to central government that we 're ready to take up a role that we weren 't ready to take up five years ago and the fact that we weren 't ready five years ago that 's neither here nor there we 're ready now and we 've said very clearly to central government we can play an equal role we can stand alongside you and I loved it i think jamie was the one who said they can they they can 't we can 't do it without them but they can 't do it without us and it 's actually the collaboration between central communities the business community through the different communities that each one of you represents around this table and represents really well so and and all of those issues about the different communities that are interested in the central city but I also interested in the areas where they live that came through really loud and clear a message that did come through for me and it has been bothering me for a long time as well as the fact that people can 't really they can 't really move on with their own lives until their insurance are settled not all the derelict buildings are a result of insurance companies either there are obviously negotiations going on between different parties and you know I do think though that the points that both yani and Paul have raised about the need to get on top of the derelict buildings is really important because I think they send a really negative message about our city and its state of progress and I think that there could be something and we will certainly raise that when we make their oral submission on the on the face of the record and relation to the in relation to the to the insurance though for the residential area I think probably would be incredibly helpful and helpfully someone 's drafted some words here along the lines of recognizing that an old hand them over recognizing that the lack of certainty regarding insurance outcomes remains a significant obstacle to regeneration for individuals and communities the council asks the crown to consider introducing a legislative mechanism that would require both public eqc and private insurers to reach a greed timeframes for settlement with all outstanding claimants and make available advocacy and technical support and mediation services to enable this to occur informally I have raised the idea of having a cut-off point for mediation to occur that 's not arbitration it 's not forcing people into final positions but it 's mediation and often mediation will enable people to see what the issues are some of the people I 've spoken to over the years they just need someone to tell them whether the deals that fair deal or not and they 've just that the trust has what they 're being told they need someone under pendant someone on their side to say this is an ok deal or it 's not an ok deal and here 's why so if we could add that to the submission I mean the feedback that I 've had from insurance companies that I 've spoken to on a very informal basis is that they would be interested in that approach and I think that I think everyone would like to bring this part of it to an end because it is stopping people from engaging and the next phase the regeneration phase of the city and if people were able to get that certainty and to have that resolution even if they could have a timeline so that they would know when things were going to get done then that would give people the ability to get excited about the next phase and the life of the city and there is a next phase and I 'd love to work one of the counselors who said this is the symbolizes a new beginning I can 't remember whether it and it doesn 't matter because I always get them confused anyway but the point that I 'm making is that it 's a wonderful opportunity and and we have to step up ourselves that 's not just a step change that 's coming you know from some someone else it 's us that has to step up and be part of that stick change I 'm so excited about the opportunity that regenerate Christchurch does give us i personally do think that it could be a model for a new way of urban urban planning and the urban sense it 's not the idea that it engages communities and in a meaningful exchange and that 's to and fro and I think that 's what 's been missing to a large extent as that sense of to and fro this certainly happened over Victoria Square and I think that 's been a hugely positive result it 's been a real 11 it 's been a 14 that the government in terms of the ccd you proposals that were initially going out the engagement with the community has actually enabled a really good model for how our city will will develop from here on and so thank you very much for for the input and I too would like to put on record my thanks to council staff who have made such a significant contribution and I know put on such a large amount of effort and her and to making this work so on that basis with the addition of these words and mediation services to occur full stop right excellent and we can tidy up the grammar afterwards so i will put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's Carrie thank you very much right and on that note I oh can I can I have a mover and a seconder for an apology from Council the back which did come through on the end and I think that was just late coming through term and Phil I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye as opposed they know that 's carried and I will declare the meeting closed thank you very much _"

    "text": "with us so if we turn to item 18 page 269 so now there 's there are a couple of issues that I know that have been raised 11 that 's that 's been raised with me is a further funding application from the residential advisory service we 've already made an application to the residential advisory service a grant to them this year and I was a little concerned to see that come back and I mean I believe it come forward to the to the meeting but I 'm not a hundred percent sure whether it 's appropriate given that there are other calls on the on the fund and thus exhausts the fund so I 'm just wondering you know sort of whether you have some advice that you 'd like to offer up on there I mean so this one 's come forward with the realization this will be the second time this financial year that this group 's come to this to this fund it came forward because the other partners were puttin up significant money of about 300,000 and councils prior representation on this 've just put it forward with a recommendation of funding because the other partners are funding but do do want to raise your attention it 's the second time in the financial year which is most unusual yeah Ellie thank you I had a couple questions with regards to the race one particularly like an SOS now yeah 4.6 four or four points 6.3 yeah just a general question who else is contributing at the stage I just couldn 't see normally in the past we 've seen a breakdown the QC insurers and so forth but I don 't see any break down under some whether they 've gone to the other organizations who to be perfectly frank right at the front of this whole issue full front of this whole issue I don 't see any rundown of who 's contributing all right but I 've actually fall asleep I 'll if that information i put my disgust ears but the organizations that have previously supported them supporting them again yeah but its degree after okay thank you is that is easily accessible 3000 from surance cancel any 's a significant funders d I 'd still like to see there it will break down on the list or the rundown on page 277 of what the costs are are you do you know what those 840 meetings at a thousand dollars a meeting is and under facilitated multi-party meetings 30 for our meetings at 1,800 bucks is at 54 grand is four hundred dollars an hour do we know what the breakdown is of what 's actually being provided in there I don 't have to break down I 'm sorry know this I mean this request came via this chief executive 's office up-to-date financial information some of which I 've received as far as view latest up-to-date accounts and my last question is this property pathways still involved in the organization and advising in the multi-party facilitation believe so okay thank you I don 't I 'm just gonna sound counselors out but if if we took this out for further work and then reference back what would people feel comfortable if we just took it out yeah rather than have a debate about whether I out sounds like that people would like it a little bit information okay so we 'll just remove the res one from the from the list of the resolution yep Andrew thank you the southern ballet it 's a significant amount that we 're looking at here and the amount they requested was significant amount clearly a significant project as well I noticed the balance between the purchase price of the building and the funds that they 've got on hand from insurance and grounds will be made up by way of a mortgage if the amount we were to grant to Southern ballet were to be reduced do they have the ability to pick that up with an increase in the in the mortgage amount I know trip was about thirty five percent equity that they would have in the 1.8 million at the moment could they reduce their equity holding and increase the size mortgage if we reduce the ground they could and I 've had that conversations with them you know it was reduced to say a hundred and fifty k they they would still enable them but even the repayments on that would still be less than the current monthly rent so if we were to grant say 144,000 drugs in 244 that would be a workable solution for them yeah so what made that have to borrow more but it would be workable but it would be sustainable yes thank you it 's a big chef from the 400 requesting 400,000 and that 's the recommendation so that would be a big shift end so as I 'm so I 'm just wondering affect how affordable then it would be to me it 's a for like I said that would still be I mean at the moment they 're paying over seventeen thousand dollars a month and rink so the repayments even if they were given a hundred fifty thousand k you know they 're still looking at other fundraising opportunities as well to try and reduce the amount that they 'll need to borrow if they can keep it under what they 're already a you know managing to pay for their current ring then Dennett 's achievable so yes of course more I mean I 'm just conversations I 've had is that it wouldn 't yes I wouldn 't directly impact on the fees that they charge they should receive a given but the what they 're doing is very much part of the pseudonym master plan for example there after an active out scoop and a really good links with cpit so I think to support them we should and see them at least fifty percent of it so there will be the 200,000 they don 't_''_443.09 incredible though they meet pro they they they do incredible things and it 's open to everybody so I think 200 lead to be well they lost them they lost their building during that is quite so it 's almost on a fly under the party unit wonderful okay the recommendation was 244 so and you 're happy that that moves to 200 so I think we 're starting to get to a point of agreement I was just really concerned that the capital values 1.3 million and I paint 500,000 above the rateable value two thousand six hundred dollars per square meter kind of wonder what 's not going in the performing arts precinct or the movement center at the Metro sports where we are spending a huge amount of public infrastructure but even just feeling that to one side funding a group just to buy property 500,000 over RV seems why incredibly the Performing Arts Crescent isn 't actually doing at the moment the Metro sports hasn 't happened at the moment southern belle i have actually kept going as best they can I think they 're actually they 're doing amazing things have been done the land area is only three 380,000 the improvements in 950,000 I 've already had the improvements done and they 're paying 1.8 million you sure they rinse seventeen thousand dollars a month that 's why it 's just over 17 thousand dollars man including GST but that that 's nearly four hundred thousand a year that doesn 't make a lot of sense I 'd love to knit properly with that you 33 person in terms yeah so on yannis valuation there 's about 35 32 to 10 boxes and and cindy behr haha 630 feet do people want some further work down to 10,000 I 've done amazing things from the earth fight they 've been up and running and I think we should sporcle there 's no question for me well increase the issuing of the audience evaluation half a million evaluations in mortgage for a significant part of this their lender wouldn 't be lending except on the current market value was delayed though can we get the food that I mean this in a way I really don 't like the Christchurch earthquake Merrill really fun and if I 'd been mere at the time it wouldn 't have been set up I just think that it 's it 's a or if I 'd been on the council time it was obviously the council set it up I think that the risk with these sorts of funds is that then the money 's not accumulated with the other funds that should have been the prime minister 's fund or it should have been there Red Cross fund you know that it really i think it 's it 's created but it 's attracted funding from so many different projects you can 't compare them you know the rally resource center versus the loons theatre trust you know day so but i think that this general agreement I know that Glenn you 're conflicted on some Paul 's Trinity Pacific presbyterian church because you 're a Presbyterian minister I 'm in the I 'm a part of the structure of the regional Church likely i could easily be seen to be thats quiet for so we 'll have you sitting apart from the boat do we have agreement that we close the detailed engineering evaluation fun and transfer the money that we approve the closure of the community volunteer works like training fund transfer that back that we grant rally that amount that we grant balloons that amount and that we grants and paul 's trinity that amount if that 's the case that 's defer southern trust and okay will where are we at with southern belle AO is put up your hand if you agree with southern ballet staying in the resolution today at two hundred thousand 123456789 service that is the motion would someone like to move the entire motion term seconded Vicky all right i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried

    "text": "oh I did Mike him another one sorry what was the other one needs quick oh no no whoa Gert would go back but I 'm not sure my office raised with me John yesterday that the leases were not happy with one of the phrases in here and first went to live and do you want to address that if I made yeah please the section 5.5 point 11 on page 248 yeah the the statement reads that subsequent to discussions that office has had with the existing Lisi 's they reemphasize their position by placing a very explicit statement to this effect in the public domain copied to ward councillors on the six of October the the concern raised by the lessee no no I think you have to start with the words that is incorrect oh right okay yeah the the what in fact happened was the Lisi 's are sent an email to their a confidential email to the tenants who live at the South New Brighton motor camp yes yeah I think we knew you get it but you don 't the proper story here here and this is just an opportunity to clarify what really yeah yeah they are the tenants seem to dollar yeah but the tenants added comments as well look I yes they did the that was brought to our attention and we immediately clarified that and made a commitment to explain that precisely to all elected members okay so so the issue is is that the statement and five point 11 I mean it 's it no one 's folders just some that 's happened the statements incorrect what happened was that the existing Lisi 's did what they should do which is keep their local residents who live in the motor camp up to speed with what was going on they didn 't want them to find out through the media that they wanted it to go out to a full EoE EoE but the only reason they want to go out to a full eoi it 's quite clearly written out here and that is that they were fearful that they would be involved in an eoi process themselves and then we would say no we don 't market so they 'd rather go out to the market see where they stand is against the market but they want to stay they want to remain involved so they let tha they let the people know who 'd lived there what was exactly going on and and they reacted to that and that was then that the confidentiality that the lessee 's asked for so the lessee 's have behaved and utter good good faith throughout the process and some of the people who live at the motor kemp decided that it wasn 't good enough and they did pass it on and I know that the counselors were copied unto that so that 's clarified that and thank you very much for doing that so do I have a movement a seconder for the motion yep David end and Glen and and then we 'll open it up for questions yep cool I 'm just trying to contrast us to salt on the pier where we granted ah no no no we can we grow in extinction excuse me this this has been through a process it has had the debate about an extension that has come back to council after we asked them to work with the currently seas about whether we could deal with them alone this hasn 't resulted in a resolution andrew reasonably simple questions how long do we anticipate the resulting release being in terms of years we will council will consider going to they the maximum which is about 35 years thank you and is that least likely to contain any special clauses relating to natural hazards or other events that could bring the lease to a premature end yes yeah so they are address that in relation to making sure that everyone goes in with that eyes open and a clause excluding counsel from liability for any adverse consequences of that event so it 's just the very basic protection that counsel would want to take making it very very clear to everyone who went into such a lease that those provisions existed apart from that nothing nothing owner us I just like to emphasize that council themselves will approve the lease and all the conditions there in and there 's have done their own due diligence around the natural hazards absolutely satisfied that they 're comfortable with what 's coming at least and then my final question really relates to something that reading the report now is a little bit not necessarily confused about but the surprised me a little bit in as much as we 've got the existing lessys supporting the fact that we go out to the wider market through an open process yeah when wouldn 't when one would have expected if the existing lessee is a wanting to continue to run this thing themselves on new lace they would have preferred to deal unilaterally with us can you tell the story of how we end up at that point because it does seem a little bit of an unusual outcome given where the existing people are coming from the initial way forward was to invite the lessee 's unilaterally to complete an expression of interest process if council determined that they were going to be dealt with unilaterally we would then have to have asked the lessee 's for a proposal the reason we have a piece of reserve and to go through the lease process we need a definite proposal to put out to the community for consultation the so we would have had to have done a request for proposal process the lessee 's have said we would prefer that you go directly with the request for proposal rather than go through an eoi with us and then a separate process so you just said something that doesn 't make sense to me just can you whine back and tell me what that the bit that you said after they they complete the eoi process what happens in the what would have happened there that then we would have had to have got a formal proposal from the lessee 's yeah the and that proposal amongst other things would have informed councils process on granting a lease over the South New Brighton domain reserve yeah so what the Lisi 's have said is rather than angry hang on I thought you said that it would then have to go out to a yes request for proposal oh no we would have to go proposing to lease the reserve what we didn 't give that advice before it 's a have any illegal of us it 's a it 's a it 's a requirement that if the existing lease has come to an end if council is proposing to lease a proportion of the reserve there is a consultation process under the reserves out that has to be undertaken it 's the standard with with just one bag that this did not begin on the fourteenth of may 2015 your prior to the election and 2013 I 'm meet with the lessee 's and they were going through this process where council was going to go out to the market because the Elise had come to an end despite the fact that they had been rolled over and rolled over in your old over this has come about because we said come on just deal with them yeah yeah and in an actual fact five point 10 reads council officers immediately advised the existing they see that an open market oh I would not necessarily shorten the process and us if there were told me that we would have had to have gone out to a public consultation something that we didn 't know was required and then the lessee 's it reemphasize the frustrations that felt over the past few years and stated that they preferred an open market approach to negate the risk of council deciding to go to the open market after that respondents thinner shoot naturally oh I yeah the the risk the perhaps I should have been cleared they are the risk they perceived they was that the council would go through an eoi they they would respond to this the response along with the other options would have been presented to council and council would have may have said are we don 't want your eoi we 'd like to go from one of these other options they are so the the less Cesar said we want to negate against the risk of that by going straight to an RFP where all the proposals are popped on the table I think I think yes somehow we 've all ended up talking past each other because what we to make an exception to policy on behalf of an exception under our procurement arrangements as we are perfectly entitled to do in a post-earthquake environment where these people have kept the place going and have offered security to people who are out of their homes for earthquake repairs who are people who live there permanently people who visit there as well I mean they have been an extraordinary s here to South New Brighton which has been so utterly damaged you know I mean I 'm sorry but this is news to me that we had to go out to a another process that would have multiplied the time and no wonder they 're frustrated i guess the you possibly describing your option to a proposal where we can just we want to keep these people on we like what they 're doing we 've made that decision as a council is there a way regardless of everything that 's gone before where we could actually just do that we could just extend the list for another 20 years i am advised that we that the lease has expired to extend a lease for that amount of time we have to follow the reserves act really clear because i actually want legal advice on the sorry Jen I was just about to recommend I know but but look what I want to do is I want to kind of maybe sort of take because the the movement second of the resolution we need progress we need to have this moving on so whether it 's by way of an open tender at this stage I mean I believe that the lessee 's will put an attender and I you know I believe that they 'll probably be the only ones but yes David I see this whole episode really has been frustration on part on the part of the lessee 's that they sort of thrown their hands up and say well it let 's just go down this this track and I was happy to support them but I 'd be equally happy to remove the my part and the second thing and we 're moving and second thing of this motion and taking some legal advice if him direct I would be quite happy that is it going to make any difference to leave it for another two weeks I wouldn 't think so so we 'll sit this paper side will put it away to two for two weeks and in that time if we don 't need to get a resolution on the table to say that we want we want we want a process that that would enable us to deal directly with the lessee 's we wanted that to happen I mean we have to resume the resolution to a certain extent because the natural hazards chapter of the district plan reviews been withdrawn so and but but the information that we have thus far as certainly on the table I I think that when you need to come back on in two weeks time and tell us explicitly what we can and can 't_''_850.94 do I think you 've heard it loud and clear these people have really stepped up and really responded to the community 's needs we want to find a way that we can make this happen they they tenure I understand reserves X has limitations on the number of years so but we will get there should be not just go straight to option to today request a proposal from the existing lessee exclusively or do we need to check in the legal implications still fail to understand how someone that naturally would choose to deal unilaterally for the good of our business would choose to deal in an open process because of frustration I think what we 're saying is we need to find some ways of removing those frustrations so that the interaction with the current Lacey is a conversation that goes we want to study County so you want you to stay and we find a way to make that preserves actors is an issue so we would look we 're not we just want to kind of bend over backwards to see if we can get a good result here so we 'll give you two weeks we 'll just let the paper lie on the table come back in two weeks on that now look I need to add a June now for half but I want to reopen the meeting at one-thirty but I want to do it and px so I 'm going to ask someone to move that the meeting go into public excluded _"

    "text": "yep David this is actually in a boil or merging the existing clean licensing people licensing by allure 2008 and the licensed waste handling facilities by law of 2007 so as I said a merging of those two bylaws significant changes they 're looking at actually defining waters hard fill and removing a lot of materials that may provide a potential for leaching into groundwater and now causing public health issues that was the main reason there was a debate around the percentage of green waste that would be allowed in the hard fill that came in there was quite a was we were proposing a halving of it went away from that it was that treatment i was with five percent truth what was the the proposal was which followed up from the previous review of this of the bylaw suggested that at the next review this one the reduction in green waste should be reduced from two percent to one percent but the panel decided to retain the total sense yeah we found found it was quite would be quite difficult to actually differentiate what 's the difference be somewhat difficult there are a number of changes the lowering air team to actually we get regulate what 's going into these landfills the support regulatory frameworks around recording of loads of the into these land bills and what 's in them and they have to be retained on file for a 12-month period and accessible for staff to review at any stage so that 's the main main changes to that by law good so I will is there any discussion Yanni I think one of the other major points from this was around the requirement for a license for the waste handling and if you think about some of the operations said gnam Springs Road kin away we heard evidence from our staff around ones that had had got resource consents that actually hadn 't got licensed through the process so if council has the ability to have licenses we can actually look at some of the other issues associated with those operations and just ensuring that it 's best practice ensuring that any any relevant matters considered and that 's really a section under handling requirements 'd agreed to move 8.1 point B but it says that it has been removed so this kind of general discretion that council have in terms of the license which i think is really important because councillor stuff will get the opportunity look at how those waste operations will be conducted and if there 's any concerns they can obviously consider that there is a licensing outside of the RMA process as which as we heard through the thing you know didn 't actually address some of the concerns that people may have so I think this is a step forward and I do think it 's important that council staff do have the ability to consider the licensing of these operations so that the issues of non-compliance that we 've had rose through the RMA can actually be dealt with in a more immediate hopefully get a bit of outcome for the way in which people are operating waste which as we know from Saddam can cause huge problem concern and local communities around the infield okay i 'll put that motion on two of the SPX of this canterbury aggregate producers group what 's the effect of this on what 's allowed to go back into exile in the chorus in effect the the Bible makes it extremely clear what came that what goes back into Cory 's is clean fill it 's very precise as to that the canterbury aggregate producers group suggested that the this this part of the bylaw was actually unnecessary the course it was handled under the Resource Management Act consent so we did actually look through the conditions of the consent for those current the current consents and it is clear that an actual fact as supported by the regional council that the bylaw is very useful in its precision and its focus in respect to clean so simply on what is clean what can go into the whole it really in respect of clean fill sets and that and the measurement of monitoring and management of the amount of waste are the two aspects that it addresses for for breaching this battle like most bylaws there there is not you would have to take a prosecution however there are other ways we have is actually apparently the possibility of removing their license people do not you know this in order to have a license that so there 's that and then there is the additional possibility of yes so a breach is if you took a prosecution you know there 's a potential of a fine not exceeding 20 thousand dollars but it took it book going to aside from the prosecution route which we all know is very really undertaken there is there 's a license fee which if additional monitoring is required for example if they are found to be not complying they can be charged they 're charged additional money for for that monitoring so that 's no so that 's it and there is also the threat to remove the license which visit and found material in the at the face of the landfill that was not permitted they would could be instructed to remove to remove that landfill blowed out of the out of the house sorry the is there any capacity for this in any way to cover demolition sites that have been filled back doesn 't deal with contaminated material books by definition that 's not clean full so they so and yes it would not be so this is that would have to be dealt with under other processes and it is not qualified to addresses great i 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye as opposed say no that 's carried thank you very much that was excellent _"

    "text": "this supplement is at the supplementary agenda where is the correct one it 's on the desk okay so the correct one is on your desk and apologies from everyone for that so who wants to David I think you then we have three bylaws that are being discussed this morning the first one is the waste management by law and it was probably the easiest one that the hearings panel had to deal with it essentially deals with the terms and conditions for our curbside collection and the panel met and recommended that the current the proposal be adopted the we only had three submissions to that one wasn 't from he can which was totally in support of the proposal and there were a couple of others that were outside the scope of the bylaw and terms and conditions so I 'll move that we had adopted the waste management bylaw 2009 right now this is the issue yani that you 've raised so it seems from advice that we 're receiving that that just moving an amendment at the meeting today may not be the best way intent by way of an amendment to this resolution today so that council can come the council staff and come back with a proposal it seems to me that what you 're trying to achieve is that is that for people who whose properties are directly related to the area where the where the wastewater I 'm sorry with a waste collection management area operates that allowing for an optin on on the side of their property that that connects would be a way of resolving it and if we could get stuff to come back with a with a solution that allows that to happen I think that wasting a lot of time on a on a on a consultative process when they came during the LTP process with a very simple statement of the problem but we need the staff to be working on a solution oh yeah I think it would be useful for stuff just to explain kind of where things are at the resolution that we 've already passed as a council was that the council naval curbs I 've been collection within central city that that asked that to be enabled I 've had some conversations with stuff and in the morning tea break I think there are working through a wider consultation about waste service collection within the entire central to yeah well we don 't need to waste our time on that now you know like I want to know can we get a resolution to the issue that 's already been raised in the LTP proceeds yeah that 's what I want to know too but just I think would be useful just to hear from staff over the timing and the secret thing that 's proposed because we might we may have a view on that or we might want to just get a report back at than a Canadian okay it 's up to you far away okay I 'm tomorrow i managed to solid waste contracts with microphone might be easier for you yet thanks um and we have certainly taken on board the resolution that came out of the consultation process through the long-term plan and have a process around that in speaking to Yanni today councillor that we are going to do some consultation to sense test the proposals that were putting out around servicing the central city and we would suggest that once we have a clear idea as to what the central cindy residents want that would be the time to amend the terms and conditions so we have written to all of the submitters to the long-term plan process and advise them that we will have a system in place for them by 1 July 2016 and currently though the way the terms and conditions of the bylaw are written fit the current situation for them and we are able to amend the terms and conditions just by a resolution of council so once we 've got enough once we have a clear direction on exactly what the services that we 're providing for them then we think that would be an appropriate time to me in the terms and conditions so do we have to wait though for that broader consultation on the whole area when it is clear that there 's a very small area which is right up hard against to the rubber then they would be in the area but they they have the capacity to put there to put their Willie buns out on the street that is collected but their technical legal address is on the other side the other Street next door which is just outside so do we have to wait for them because it seems to me that a solution an opt-in solution for them could potentially be arranged ahead of the broader consultation about the inner city area because I understand why you 'd want to do a proper consultation around the inner city generally but on this particular issue is it not possible for us to move a resolution that would enable you to to come up with a solution for them now well under councils financial policy there 's a defined area that 's specifically excluded from the collection from the curbside collection contract so they 're in what we call our in a city collection area which is a user pays big system currently and so we 've spoken to our contractors and got some indicative prices around a review would write they would rather we do this in a organized fashion rather than a piecemeal fashion and that we do 1 review of the whole area and we 've got a number we got a submission I understand from Fletcher living around the Eastern frame developments which is very high density in which to be freeing would be a disaster if we had a couple of hundred wheelie bins lined up on the street around some of those properties so we do see it is important to do a slightly wider picture but we are open to doing so so I understand why a contractor wouldn 't want this to be done in a piecemeal fashion but if there is a solution for a very small number of residents who are but you know immediately the area of the collection on an optin basis couldn 't we I mean are we without the possibility of even making a shared facility available to that set of units that could be wheeled out onto what 's that peterborough street is that the street it 's kilmore street yeah because kilmer street right have i got that right it 's cambridge terrace sorry cambridge terrace assumed that 's their technocore dress but they go right on to kill moss street on the other side is I 'm very familiar with this particular companies that have had a number of conversations with the residence yes I have their number of councillors I understand it and we that complex is slightly more complicated than it might appear and that while the ground level occupants of that complex are very Pro wit leoben 's the ones that live on the upper floor units are slightly less pro and I think they would firstly a financial policy does specifically exclude them so we do need to amend their or council does need to amend that and that end our financial policy advisor has been working on something that we believe does address the issues around the inner city collection both those that wish to receive the same level of services everyone else in the city and those for whom it 's not practical but as I see it we are we are open to direction sort it there 's a number with new residential developments that are going in so there is a wider issue about how we 're so overarching issue a thing is if if you look at this matter of with a current central city collection is I mean I think it 's fair to say that there 's a whole area that 's quite south of Litchfield that makes its all commercial no residential they get the residential burn service and there 's residential areas that get the non-residential service so it does need a tidy up I just thought like as we 've done with businesses and temporary recovery premises they can opt into the curbside collection so can non-profit organizations who have their rates remitted they can opt-in so I just don 't quite understand what the hard thing as if someone says I 'd like to opt into the service and I 'm prepared to pay the cost of having their service we 're the trucks go past why that would be such a big issue as it because you could get too many people opting in and not that of just a financial thing from our systems that they can 't record who 's opt it and I just don 't understand why there would be such a difficult thing operationally it 's not a particularly difficult thing the issue for us is around having sort of doing at once and doing it properly and also I 'm not sure we would stand in terms of policy because as I said these people are in an area that are specifically excluded from the service so a sports facility is in an area that 's entitled to the service they just don 't pay the rate for the service so once they pay the cost of the service it 's fine but this particular group and their current financial policy is specifically excluded we 've had a submission illness at the long-term pain and they want to follow up subset could we possibly just while we do the entire review but no problem with during the entire review just actually have a policy that says where residents are in a street that adjoins the residential been collection those residents my original question could we be that simple you are saying that because of the financial policy that we can 't do that but I 'm saying I don 't know the answer to that question well the financial policy point of view from a fun can we gotta see that 's what I 'm saying is can we move in ammendment that sees request staff to report back to the next council meeting with with a response to the tip a potential temporary solution to the to the property between Gilmor Street and Cambridge atira so it will specifically target the set of ones that we know we 're not talking about making it mandatory for everyone who 's in the complex we 're talking about making it op done for people who can put their wheelie bins on the on kilmore street so we 're not talking about sending the wheelie bin collection and to cambridge terrace we 're just talking about making they opt-in provision available to those that want two wheeler burn out to the other side and it might be that part of the temporary units that might want to opt in together and have you know sort of one set of wheelie bins for further for those that want to opt in or you know a large set for for them you know simply a temporary solution so it 's not a piecemeal solution in the sense that this would be permanent it will be temporary until we get a resolution to the central city collection area yeah Phil can I just raise another issue and I don 't expect it an answer today at all but it 's just really when the review is being done how the issue for older people people who choose to stay at home and to have their medical care at home and where they might have quite serious incontinence problems and originally purchased or ask for a small red button and in fact need a much larger one and the cost of that for some people is very steep so it 's just house council we might manage that issue given that the district health board policy is aging in place and we 've got an aging for the review don 't need any immediate answer now or even till early next year in review is being done well Mb right now we can but I 'm also suggesting that longer-term we need to look at it from a broader perspective than just the there it 's a subsidy for health-related reasons and I think we actually have to separate it from the contractor issues and that and the account we wouldn 't do it as a direct subsidy because you 'd have you 'd have a contractor having to decide whether or not a person qualified well they don 't do that I agree and it 's a wider issue around sorry yep sorry maybe I 'm wrong no no no not at all and if I may answer that though we actually do have a relationship with ones with people that have significant issues so if they have if they 've originally gone for a small 80 litre rubbish bin as an example wins cover the cost through a special process we work closely with the cdhb on this too and to confirm that this a standard size rubbish bin it 's wider than those that would be eligible for a winning subsidy to David and then unclean well we had a vital review that was looking at curbside collection rules across the city and maybe the answer to this is to actually look at point one in the attachment B which is the definition of where we going to collect and if we I 'm sort of reluctant to sit see the bylaw not approved but maybe there is a recommendation to review point one in some manner to accommodate the the area that we 're talking about we are talking about you know certain circumstances here where rates remitted properties permanent dwellings on non rateable land can apply to opt in to the curbside delivery service so I can 't see why we couldn 't be able to use that provision to allow these people to opt in yeah that I mean that fits that 's what we really need staff to report back on though because I 'm what I 'm hearing from staff as a reluctance to actually make an amendment a week how many units are we talking about I mean the total total when the complex I 'm only talking about the one complete if you had if you look at the complex is there no no that complex how many units really accomplished I think there 's about 20 MIB 25 and what we 're hearing is that the upstairs ones don 't want to op done so we 're probably talking about maybe a dozen days and it 's probably the only unique one there might be one or two others there will be the only one that actually has a property frontage to the existing curbside collection rather than simply just having a frontage to for the inner city once it 's unique in that regard to yes on the drawing bit that 's why we 're only talking about this one is because it 's right about onto the onto the collection area at the moment and I think but I 'm kind of not wanting to I 'm trying to find a way through this that gives staff the ability to walk back with or what we 've heard is that we can do it by way of resolution and mend the terms and conditions so I 'd rather that they come back to us on the terms and conditions with a temporary solution which doesn 't require us to review our entire financial policy in that regard approve the bylaw now yeah I want us to adopt the terms and conditions of the waste management by law 2009 and I want us to request staff to report back to the next council meeting with a response to the potential for an optin provision for wheelie bin collections as a temporary solution for the residential complex on cambridge terrace which has a frontage on on chemistry and then there 's the wider wider ok project the complex at 281 cambridge terrace and then the water called Jillian courts there is the then the water any danger ocean of the inner city collection to other areas will be reviewed yeah that 's a separate issue and what if you 're comfortable with this day but I 'm going to get you to move the adoption don 't need to do it by way of an amendment we can make it part of the motion you 're happy with that gleam or think you 're just a plea to in the scope of that review please to look at discretion so I 'm finding what review what review these turned out additions a report in the terms and conditions ok this is the reveal all right location of the terms ok with the report I 'm finding this policy totally unbending so I think of lv residents wanting a replacement been EG don 't notice it 's missing for 24 hours there 's still faced with a big bill we have all these outstanding pins and the residential red zone and yet that there 's just no room to move so can we look at some kind of please discretion in that that would be really useful i I acknowledge our email exchange over the other matter that 's I 'm not bringing that up but this is over so if you don 't notice it 's missing for 24 hours you have to pay from 's gone missing you just can 't find it and it was a submission on that point to the hearing panel yep yep I have sympathy for doing that the flexure loving development in there East oh hang on are we going to get an answer to Lena 's question first so I 'm just not where we have over the years we 've fresh doubt this 24-hour question on a number of occasions we 're very reluctant to move on that because as soon as we bring in discretion it takes to power off the call center to you know it 's then up to an individual staff member to be here to make that decision and we since we introduced that provision we 've also found that most people find their Willie Byrn the next day while the 24-hour thing is there and they 'll encourage too and they know they have to pay for it they go around visiting their neighbors and inevitably retrieve their bin you know it 's it 's a very reactive thing if we do that and we 'll just create more work there 's no room for a situational approach so in this case that Ben was stolen the couple didn 't go out to actually retrieve it within 24 hours and I don 't think this is he rly everyone does do that couldn 't find it it was stolen and still had to pay for a new but it 's just having some flexibility but I kept at it as a breach of the bile or if they don 't you know if you leave your bike out on the footpath for 24 hours it 's going to get stolen we need to encourage people to take ownership of their bones and you know it 's it 's been well we advertise we 've reiterated the messages on a number of occasions and just from a workload perspective I think it would become a huge unmanageable task I think that I think that those individual cases because they are actually you know if you and far between but they are they are a concern because I agree that I mean you wouldn 't leave property out for people to steal pouring with rain though and you 're older you may not go out and get sold them but you have it kind of is done and so you don 't go to you probably for a week and you find it all but that 's a different issue you haven 't lifted out so and in those cases I think that coming back through the council in terms of you know getting funding for for replacing it under those circumstances I think there 's got to be another way of dealing what they 're there essent that doesn 't encourage people to bring their buns baked and after 24 hours I mean it 's a it is difficult I mean I look I know but I also know that you can publicize things till you 're blue in the face and it doesn 't mean anything to anyone if they hadn 't received the publicity I mean I didn 't get my bun emptied once because the lid was up a little bit I had no idea that that was the rule I doubt dunno but I go past Aisha push it down or move stuff into my burn I just don 't let anyone around me get caught like I did so but it just you know but the answer that 's governor 's is that we we publicize this people know this well actually people don 't necessarily know this so we just have to keep repeating the message Ellie can I just make a comment though around bins being leaked out longer than 24 hours for people who aren 't living in that property or out of that property for repairs and there are still a lot of people like that and they pop round they put some stuff in the bin they put the burnout they might be living elsewhere so what I 'm saying is that there may be exceptions and this is where in these exceptional times possibly some discretion or something could be applied also if there are trades people in the house sometimes they ask if they can put the burn out for someone but not be back the next day you know just as an exceptional yeah but the thing is if you if you do there I mean that 's what we that it 's very difficult but that 's the bylaw says you have to notify effort if that 's nothing personal but it 's a hospital and that partly have to go with them yeah no it 's just no room yes that 's right but there is there is room with them after the after the decision to charge there is room beyond that but you take it away from the from if you take it away from the front line it doesn 't that doesn 't solve the problem there are other ways well there 's other ways of dealing with it be outside they 've breached the bile or they 've got to pay for a new one whether whether the council actually assumes the cost of their do we actually charge people for a new vin what 's the occurrence around the city currently we 're looking at about a hundred bins a month we 've got all the spear in the reason I would just answer the comment about the red zone we 've recovered about sixty percent of the bins from the red zone and my recent trips into the red zone haven 't indicated a lot of bins lying around there we 've worked very closely with Sarah around the port hills red zone bringing bends down off the properties that are too dangerous for general people to enter and as an example of the type of challenges were dealing with they brought down 70 bins on the sunday afternoon on the Monday when we went to recover them there were under 50 still there so we do have a significant issue with people and utilizing what they see is fear fins and and we are working on that I 'm with regard to the questions around charging my concerns are around the precedence we see it so if you 're saying if you if you say it 's discretionary it 's very difficult to argue one case over another unfortunately in this city everyone has a story the question the question is how much do you want the ratepayers to assume if the direction is that we don 't charge missing a month no we probably get requests of about 300 odd a month but are we because they 're reported within a 24-hour period we where the cost delays well actually the contractor is the cost of those Oh suggestion a couple of those ago that we might microchip bins yeah of all graduate exactly one of the options who are looking at and if we did microchip bins and then that was sort of widely known in the community that Albans were going to be microchipped would that and would we have the ability to track bins that were not at the right probably I mean if they were on the property not and not out put out and could we could you do a drive down down the street checking checking on bins and then there was a bin behind the house that had the wrong microchip and it would you be able to take that correctly we have a we have a paper coming to counsel in December which will address all those issues and yes we are proposing that RFID tags be put in all outside the right address and I will deal with all the stolen burner shoes the RFID is that like the dog market trips so basically all the library books say when you go to find the bin you can identify it but in terms of actually knowing where it as if you can 't find it does it does it help no but it solves the problem of people taking buns and taking the dress offer and then using those buns yes but what it doesn 't solve is a few bin school missing you know no but unless we put GPS inside the bones we 're not going to find them we 're not going to put GPS and ass William burns correct you 're correct there it 's not a GPS no it 's instinctive it 's an RFID tag but in the truck picks it up they 'll know if it 's at the right property but it does solve the problem of having the wrong buns watch people and people are utilizing buns that don 't belong to them term for deported and December and I file or whatever so that 's really for me the key that will be the deterrent for people stealing and using other buns the other thing is we are a large city and for the fact that matter is if you are not living in the property and you go to your property you fella burn up and put it out you 've done it you 've got to take responsibility going to get it my mother 's 89 and she puts her burn out and when she 's having trouble the guy that comes and helps her is 92 so they can do it I mean come on you know we do have to take self-responsibility waste it 's not always black yeah wicked I really don 't you know yeah we 've taken three quarters an hour on this so far okey go back to the go back to the central city and have reflectors interval T I 'm actually meeting Fletcher 's this afternoon so I 'm just intrigued about this one and so they will want for the residential development in their East frame and the that the last thing you wanted was the view of all of those will events as you drove through but is there another solution in terms of shared green dance or even ribbons or what okay so put so part of the work that we 're doing as also including excluding people so multi-unit developments we want to have the ability to opt out okay because no developer wants to provide space on their land for 200 wheelie bins we can 't vary the curbside collection to other than a fortnightly collection so by the developers allowing to opt out it gives them the ability to have a commercial collection where they have a skip on site and it can be empty daily and this is their preference but this is this but then but it won 't be it won 't it won 't separate the types of ways well yeah they can still have they can still don 't know i don 't want they still can have I want them to be required to separate so part of the proposal is that they will have to apply criteria so our criteria would be that they would have to be consistent with councils waste minimization and management plan and we 're only proposing this for developments over a certain size we are it 's very difficult to service we were aware prior to the earthquakes around some challenges and high-density developments so and we we will we are working very hard to make sure that it 's not just anyone who can choose to be excluded that there are some very strict parameters around making sure that not everything goes to rubbish and that will come back to us yes Board 's decision yes once we finish the consultation so before it goes out consultation do we get to input into what 's in it and what we 're asking we 're asking we know we 're doing a consultation about what the the needs of the residents within the central city area are yes and can at the moment at fletchers I guess as a substitute for the people we 're actually going to be living in the area that you 're talking about hang on so 's what we 've been talking about oh I know that but but the actual motor unit that 's in there about developers about is over how many units and so our proposal is it will be over 20 units I mean that 's not set in stone but we are proposing there is one of the trigger points I 've worked very closely with the developer and well street at this point and given the restrictions of our current waste management by law and our current collection contract around high density they are going to be presenting their bins in a private lane at the rear of the complex okay it 's a developer you can get apply for an exemption so here 's one skeptic click all the rubber no because if it 's done by cubic meters and as accounts we can pretty well guess and have calculations on how much cubic meter of rubbish first rate etcetera and the developers will head that as well so there would be no difference to have one booth skip to collect rubbish or three skips one for organics if imagine there could be no exemption that waste mineralization would have to be following a midwife and no not entirely and because often some of the challenges are around safely entering into the complex to collect skips and one of the one of the things that would free up the progression of these developments and ensure that we 're still receiving diversion but also being able to process it in a safe way is that and I 've completely lost my train of thought there for a second sorry about it it doesn 't happen to me very often and so the idea is that they 'll be able to be collector more regularly so under a curbside collection service and if you you know you entitled under the waste management by law to 240 litres of recycling per household 140 litres of rubbish and 80 litres of organics their ends up being even if you go to skips for a hundred unit complex a significant space that has to be put aside so in terms of things that we would look at when we 're assessing whether people could they were emptying and the amount of capacity they were providing so you could significantly shrink there if you 're emptying it every day as an example saying then not that i 'm a pessimist or anything but if i were a developer and i was thinking right i want to get an exemption so if I design my complex to make it quite difficult for a truck to get on there for that would have given me an edge over getting exemption rather than saying accounts are saying but actually to gain exemption or to put the Sun we we need you to ensure that you could access we do it with supermarket car packs for instance why wouldn 't we do it with a comp lit realize it 's not your area but that 's the rule that what they would be following surely well and in the council City play and they definitely are minimum requirement around waist unfortunately and the advice I 've received from the planners in a lot of the developments I 've seen currently they 're submitting that they will provide less waste which I tend to disagree with but I 've been advised that waste isn 't one of the things the consents would be rejected on and so what would what we 're trying to do in some ways is to recognize the limitations were operating under and come up with the best possible solution for the situation in addition to their a number of the developers that I have spoken to and I don 't get to speak to all of them are really to be frank I only get to speak to the ones that are proactive and have been really on board in terms of one who work to address these issues and its greater that 's interesting that to get exemption hit she has nothing to do with your waste that has X about more to do with access to remove the waste for the contractor rather than the process of waste itself I 'm just surprised by their among have I got this wrong I don 't know that if we did nothing if you didn 't consult with anyone and we did nothing they would bag collection because they 're be inside the zone unfortunately the eastern frame isn 't inside the inner city collection oh I see the well street one gets the normal three burn system and they don 't want it because they get charged for it when they say actually we don 't actually want it because we 've got high density in a confined space we 'd rather have a different well no but this is what their submission was we don 't want to pay for it because we actually want to do it a different way then you 've got the eastern frame which is ironically in the inner city collections are into the plastic bags which is going to be residential it doesn 't have access to the residential curbside service so there 's two different issues within those sorry the eastern frame is covered by the inner city collection which is the plastic bag system but that 's why I just see no no that emit that Eastern frame unfortunately is our outside of the inner city collection that 281 cambridge street is right on the you just said this isn 't this in there I can show you where the inner city collection goes it 's the grey line and there 's cost there 's let 'em a square and here 's the eastern frame that is definitely earned the central business district curbside collection part of it maybe but unfortunately well street wasn 't so there 's different that is Wall Street 's not 30-something no but the eastern frame I 'm trying to understand whether the eastern frame we sort of strain from the sub corner well now we 're here got a resolution to to address cambridge terrace we were hearing that we 're having a complete review by the 31st of july of jun 24 jun next year and i think we 're actually string way away from the it seems to me that this that the eastern frame except where it 's amin well he had the whole of the eastern frame is in the central business district daily rubbish collection area it 's i mean i miss this maps out of date no no the collection map is an apologize i understood that well street was part of the fleet chillin oh I don 't write about well street nothing to do with well street yeah different devout yeah so I 'm not entirely sure where the eastern frame is actually I 've between men choose from address then it will be predominantly within the anything so what I 'm saying is is that unless you do what you 're doing and and bring an amendment to the council when these are built they 'll be covered by bags not by a proper system of collection and disposal our waste management process currently that would be correct yes and and so that 's why it 's really important that we get it right on the central city so it was worth just getting that clarified because I don 't want anyone to think that this is actually about making things worse actually leaving it the way it is couldn 't be worse for the city 's release management we 've already heard that we 're having a complete review of yeah City Central City collection process which is why the I 've got a mover why am I their counselor Easter 's moved the motion do I have a seconder pawling ok give it a second look oh okay jaani jaani sickened so i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried we move on _"

    "text": "who have we got sitting up for this one it 's too late we 've moved on now vianney no no it dont for it we just what i was just joking or was humor don 't you recognize humor well i said thanks for waiting did not either alright yani I guess the concern I 've got and you know I appreciate the width of the hearing panel 's done there was a submission concerned about the freedom camping at some mixes some life surf lifesaving club and just just wanted to check what the hearing panel 's response has been because as you become more extreme across other areas of the study I just I wonder what that will do to areas that haven 't I couldn 't find any discussion around what you 've done to mitigate that risk to those other areas that some people did make submissions on concerned about the implications so was it any discussion about this because in the maps that we 've got is no there 's nothing about for summit area which is a historic area where we have had more restricted or prohibited areas and there was also discussion on where we or had where we could or how we could put some wider blanket restrictions and the legal advice we received on there in a general sense was that we under the legislation we 're not able to create a bylaw that deals with problems that don 't exist so if in areas where there wasn 't a problem or there wasn 't a reported problem it made it very difficult for us to put additional prohibition prohibitions in place in the context of where we 've made areas prohibited or where we 've put restrictions where that causes a spill over into other areas of freedom campers we 've addressed that by making sure that there are appropriate places where freedom camping is allowed so for example the winter would be one area that is green on the map which if somebody was heading out of town in that direction we would hope that that 's where they would head to but the other way that we 've addressed it is that we do have any unintended displacement issues that we weren 't anticipating so all of a sudden we get people freedom camping along the waterfront at Red Cliffs or whatever it might be we do have that provision for a review after two years rather than five that it allows us to address those issues soon around them later and you 'll note that one of the resolutions has got a report coming back to Dave 's committee at the end of this first summer season so that we get an early heads up on any displacement issues and therefore any need for further enforcement or things that we need to be looking at out that review stage so cool oh sorry just I 'm just I 'm just trying to understand because like if you take the central today they 've been almost no complaints around the south of Litchfield area and yet you 've got some nerve which has had historically has had numerous complaints around freedom camping so I sort of struggle to understand and I personally would feel uncomfortable that if we had to review it in two years if we from and again because we just got a mess I can 't see any as in no prohibition around the summer well no that 's slightly incorrect because that 's what some that will be a an area that is restricted to self-contained freedom camping so any any camp event that turned up that was not self-contained could be moved on immediately or slept with a fine but the rest of the city predominantly well it is as a self-contained two nights only area so effectively what we have done is to ban non self-contained camping anywhere in the city apart from the brooklands area windsor park and there compact anywhere else in the city there is not know where that freedom camping unless you our self contained as permitted did you want to add to that to add if it might be helpful to have a look at Matt 23 which is the general map for that stops at 22 oh yes we met 23 shows the bring it over just to just to just confirm really what cuts on East has just said that within that area campervans only for two nights and any 30 day period and yeah okay our Paul ionization solar system at the displacement of these freedom cameras even even contain the self-contained freedom camping does actually itself bring issues around noise and activity in areas sometimes we don 't want to miss taken up big RV pulls at that so on this blown something that blocks the view for that and you can get civil a gravel on there so there 's this house it of concerns that I have and and I not put it and you know looking at the thing overall I 'm very pleased to see that you make see ya don 't climb for the work to actually address and maintain the issue so all the staff to wait with bated breath to see how it rolls out over the summer okay now i do want to kind of conclude the debate so did you have another question yep okay yeah i just want to clarify this quickly because obviously people see this and draw parallels with the issue we 're dealing with Street workers with bylaws this EXCI City Council a city council only land owned or managed by the city cop right so I need I just needed to ask that to make it really clear because that is one of the key issues as to why this can 't just be translated into a street worker Bible thank you made under a specific freedom company right thank you yeah all right so is there any further debate yani again I commend the work of this hearing panel I I do have some concerns and I guess we 'll just as my colleague said we 'll just wait wait and see what what happens but I do think you know fundamentally we want tourism and we want visitors to our city we 're doing a whole visitors strategy and the reality is that self-contained or non self contained vehicles people coming into our city freedom camping is actually part of the visitor culture that exists in New Zealand so I have a little bit of concern about the central city I can 't personally understand why you would then freedom camping from the industrial areas within when you 've had no complaints other parts of the central city that have been problematic in the past by criminal square I can totally understand why you would why would consider having some sort of restrictions so thanks to the hearings we know for the work that they 've done on I mean obviously Paul that I will be watching it to see what happens in our area still have a bit of concern that by prohibiting it across a wider area you will concentrate the problem at them into other areas so we will wait and see and hopefully that doesn 't enjoy and but if it does hopefully we can have a quicker response and then waiting for two years okay i 'll put the motion then all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you very much and thank you for all of your work on there _"

    "text": "say don 't you feel spinning out briefing about so the next item on the agenda is the hearings panel report for the proposed new freedom camping by law do we have well we 'll start off if there are any questions in relation to that before we move it and second it Andrew you do want to have you got any questions that you want to ask or should we just questions maybe if we have questions to staffers who suggest make more happy to introduce the item after okay has anyone got any questions because I 'll get Andrew to introduce the item that fits okay yeah great all right thank you so I 'm particularly pleased to have got this to this point it 's been going on for some time but it 's great that we 've got this report in front of us today we went out for public consultation and there were two public hearings meetings held in the areas that the majority of submissions came from so that was a corolla for the banks peninsula submissions and New Brighton which was another area well those public hearings meetings were actually handled quite differently than the traditional hearings that we 've had in relation to bylaws and other consultation matters in the past each submitter was given the opportunity if they wanted to take it to spend five minutes presenting to the hearings panel and then there was a series of group discussions at tables around the room with a counselor sitting at each table with a hearings panel member sitting as each table to tease out the issues so that we could really get a feel for not only what community members were saying but why they were saying it and what the solutions some of the problems or some of the issues they were wanting dealt with work and overall once people understood the process and that it was different from the traditional process I think the feeling of the hearings panel and staff was that that worked quite well in terms of teasing out issues and assisting with better quality deliberations after those hearings meetings so in summary of the way that we responded to the submissions there been some changes is that the three days which was to be allowed for non self contained freedom camping is now reduced to two days and that was in response to submissions around the number of days and there have also been some changes to the prohibited areas we 've actually added more prohibited areas that are shown red on the maps notably at the North ramp in New Brighton which was one of the areas that we received a significant number of submissions on and that featured strongly in the hearings panel discussion and also on banks peninsula in particular there were areas where there were cultural values areas of cultural significance that we hadn 't really picked up to the the right degree it 's fair to say in the information that went out for consultation it became very quickly once we got into the hearings in a Corolla that there was a need for further engagement with local Runanga in particular in response to the comments that were made at the a Corolla meeting we actually held a separate meeting with local Runanga representatives which drew attention to the fact considered and in particular that we hadn 't had due regard to the ely management plan the areas of cultural significance and the silent files on the banks peninsula map so that resulted in some changes to increased red areas on the banks peninsula map in particular onel way rapaki takamatsu bird links flat o nuku and cook orator so they were all areas that were covered by those silent files and were seen as areas of cultural significance another key change represents the the non self-contained permitted the key one of those is that there 's no green area at the North ramp that 's gone red it 's gone prohibited and the other key change was that there is now no provision for any non self-contained freedom camping in the a Corral Township and again that was purely in response to some very strong submissions we receive from a corona people around that the reason for the matter being considered today is the some we want the bylaw to take effect almost immediately on the first of December so that it 's in place ready for the summer some of the the summer holiday related issues that we have seen in past years the approval of the bylaw today would result in a public notice which then allows the bylaw to go live on the first of December there have been some conversations around signage obviously we 're not able to get all of the signage in place immediately it 'll take some time to get all of the signage in place but we have given a steer and also taken staff advice around the key areas for signage in the areas which are prohibited so that 's made very clear and the boundaries of the non self-contained allowed areas that of course makes any enforcement over the summer months a lot easier if we 've got that signage in place very very quickly so this is a pragmatic and sensible approach to a problem which has become greater over the last couple of summers over the last couple of years and particularly looking at some of the eastern seaboard issues in the city some of the city issues since the earthquakes as well we appreciate that this see them at the moment and it 's a solution within the framework that we 're allowed to a solution that we 're allowed to put forward within the legislative framework there are parts of it that may turn out not to be ideal there may be problems that we haven 't taken into account here or the response to what we 're doing may cause and some issues that need to be dealt with for that reason we 've put a two-year review period on this rather than a five-year review period so that if there are any unanticipated outcomes we 're able to deal with those within a sensible type of time frame so I 'd certainly would think the other members of the hearing panel for the the work that they put into this there were a couple of extra meetings notably the one with Runanga and a separate final meeting as well so that we could get this to this point within the time frame and I 'd also like to acknowledge and thank the the excellent work the staffer put into this it was a that staff were able to provide to is in the way that they were provide the additional information we asked for made the deliberations of the hearings panel much easier than they otherwise would have been so thank you to all concerned and I 'd certainly appreciate the support of councillors to get this some approved today so that we can get it in place okay so that 's moved by Andrew do I have a seconder for the motion glynn did you want to speak to it I just wanted to add to Andrews presentation that the the format by which we deliberated sorry engaged with the submitters was a different process that that we have engaged previously and it was more of a roundtable type of discussion with the various people have put a submission forward previously a submitter would get five minutes to present their case and the option for the panel to us then asked questions and this by law review we adopted a different tact we did allow some submitters if they wish to actually use their five minutes but then we had a roundtable each each table and and basically allowed them to have a Philly open and frank discussion about the issues and then rejoined as a group at the end to get commonality of the various views that came through I just like put on record it was it was a very good way of engaging with the submitters and they at least had the opportunity I felt to express themselves a lot more freely and tease out things that they normally may not have had the opportunity in a restricted time frame a very good process and I think it 's with expanding upon and future by law reviews or all means of consultation just like to make their coming exact Len and then Jamie okay thank you yes I think it was a good process this still for those though who are used to engaging with the council they still expect their moment in the Sun so I think we just have to be mindful of debt that they still do expect that kind of formal submission process all I would say is over this that it will come to with any bile or over discretion we 're still dealing with obviously homeless issues and many of our coastal communities so we do anticipate that in the policing of it there will be that discretion exercised and that people needlessly you know moved on where they genuinely need accommodation but it had become a it was affecting community well-being particularly in that the new brighton areas there so you 'll see that that prohibited area also extends to the south rim that makes life a whole lot easier for our coastal ranges cracking hey Jamie yeah it was a good process I 'm you 'll recall that initially I I felt that this proposal didn 't go far enough I felt that I a better outcome might have been to be more restrictive around this and I I pushed I think was actually by way of amendments for some more prohibit prohibited areas and also I propose that the three night max went to a one night max but i think i think the art and whether its business or governance and certainly as a counselor is to not not of we don 't shun the good today in search of the perfect tomorrow and i see that happen sometimes time and time again and it 's never the right way to go because actually what we 've got here is really good it I see that you 've have got more prohibited areas it has gone from a three-night maximum down to a two night maximum and I really I really commend the staff on this all the submitters those involved on the panel you 've done a really good job and I think what we 've got here is very good so I also community I think the pragmatism around the review instead of being five years been two years of that 's correct I think it 's a really good way to go so well done to all of you and I think what we have is very good so I 'll most certainly be supporting it um is there anyone else cuz well if there 's gonna be more I 'm gonna have to adjourn there item because we have to move on to the presentation no no we were having the top I ask four questions earlier on her by ona from the start of this report sorry I 've had my hand up since I started this report I 'm sorry right at the very outset I asked if anyone had any questions of staff and there were no questions of staff so i moved to Andrew to present the report so I wasn 't aware that you 've moved fast your questions but okay well we 'll take

suggest that if there are questions that really do need to be directed to the chief executive then I 'll I 'll defer the report to when she 's here which will be the next meeting of the council but if we want to just quickly highlight any of those issues but otherwise adopt the report and then ask Arlene to come back to us on those other matters so Glenn thank you over a straight foot will in my view I think it 's a straightforward question just on page seven about debt about the year in which we might anticipate that get it to revenues bulova so with a pep sign or yeah that 's a single reason to ask the acting chief executive I don 't die UNS come especially for those questions right right die oh no no don 't die brandish is here to you now the say spillover I 'm sorry could you destroy us okay so that ratio of not exceeding two hundred fifty percent of dictor revenue we had it pinned down to a certain year that 's now pushing out well the financial strategy actually had us not exceeding the ratio remember that was part of the of the issue of looking at the sum of the sales proceeds and also the capital program it 's true as the capital program is being revisited than it does push out but it it will not be exceeded its just the peak moves as as the owners move so that yet that 's probably more my question where that peak is anticipated to be now well right now it 's still wear it wasn 't_''_130.92 in the long-term plan because we haven 't finalized the annual plan but as that as the components are pulled together which is scheduled for around the 18th of december we will have a clearer picture and come back to then we will have all of that detail available to us as we go into the annual plan process okay just wondering if we could ask for a reported under the customer services and online channels page nine we 've got a lot of reporting on the number of requests people making but we don 't have any feedback on the resolution of those requests so I know a number of us are just getting contacted with people who are quite concerned we 've just had another one this week it is it possibly get some information back around how we 're processing those requests and what that not the acknowledgement of the request but the completion of the request being done is so maybe you know X number of a quiz for May for potholes and fifty percent we 're done in one month you know 52 seen that I 've been done over the next she was but it 's just it would be really good in terms of a future of war to get some understanding so that we can possibly some solutions to how we might actually address some of those concerns that have been outstanding yeah I think that that 's a that 's a an easy addition to the to the monthly report as you know how those are tracking for resolution I think one of the challenges of snaps in solve is that it doesn 't have a mechanism for advising what the outcome was and you know given the scale of compare well not complaints but but but issues that get put into the system I think it 's something like a hundred thousand and a year is that it 's an extraordinary number that comes through the system and I think that 's going to be a challenge as we move to a much more streamlined and electronic system whereby we can feed back those those outcomes very quickly I mean I did think that having snaps in solve followed by solve snaps ind would have been quite a good model but it also would be incredibly challenging but to give people answers to the fact that the work has been completed it 's also challenging in a contracting environment because a contractor may in fact clear a particular problem but not necessarily have resolved what the person complained about so addressing it would be that the people in the call center no no we 're not going to solve the problem around the table that we are going to we 're going to make sure that that 's part of future reporting Ellie now you just add into that as well I think the issue is that so many comments requests coming from so many different areas that 's one of the key issues and I didn 't understand that until recently sites made it quite yeah how difficult it is and it 's not a quick fix my questions on page 9 it says she understands in solved too but it 's just around graffiti and I wonder if it 's seasonal because of weather and fly tonight 's and what have you but certainly and shooting clapping oh we we sing Speights of it over weekend is there any ability to break those graffiti complaints and issues and toward in towards please can I just add the graffiti team is phenomenal one of the most positive things that we get feedback on is the pace and speed at controlling the issue but I just wanted to say that publicly there phenomenon and the last tool that they did the graffiti had dropped by fifty two percent in the city was that an annual thing or he sits the email or dry tell you thanks David thank you just on the health and safety page on page 17 I 'm just wondering really whether we needed some more detail maybe doesn 't need to come here might come to rig and consents on the sort of actions we are taking over lost time injuries particularly we have known any serious harm once but i would like to probably just see a little more detail of what what sort of incidents we are attracting and how we are responding to them and how we are moving towards preventing that sort of action escalating the information is definitely available so we 'll get it to appropriate committee oh and Paul this is probably just for noting and something that we 've on what the chief executive tuition look into it I know with some of the policy by laws were ish whilst will issue being really you know seen a big reduction we 've seen a massive increase and derelict properties becoming a target and a real disgrace to the city if you walk down here if it 's street and factor you look across the skyline the graffiti is out of control and we need to fix it we need to figure out how we can actually in some of these may be vacant land owners or property owners to issue sort out their problems because i think it 's especially a bad reflection on the city right of the account at the moment yep so is there anything that i don 't think there 's anything stopping us receiving the report and we 'll get the chief executive to follow up on those issues so move by Jamie second of item I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye as opposed say no that 's carried thanks very much thanks died _"

    "text": "a public participant presenter tears an opera ramanan bow on a request to work with a city on a feasibility for a cupboard crash at international market again I think we 've had you here before it is yes yes good morning your mare and worship you have had me here before and I want to thank you for giving me the opportunity to return to address you once again I just want to start apart from wishing you good morning by thanking all of you for your wonderful support that you have lent to the idea of our market in the central city I 'm pleased to say we have a number of ethnic women who are now licensed with council to cook food under the new regulations and they 're able to cater from the market it is only a beginning but I thought it is a great beginning and bodes well for our city and the relationship with the community however I do believe that going back to the original vision that we had of looking at a feasibility for an international market for our city and thinking that in 2016 it might be an opportune time to look at a feasibility study for such an outcome I decided it 's good to look at a feasibility study because then it helps us to explore what the community needs are in terms of international people are migrant communities housing them their activities and small business interests on a much wider scale of course we are working in this market project to do it and show you know with some runs on the board as it were in a small way so we 're very committed to that process and pleased to say that everyone involved is and so I 'm here just to request an opportunity to work once again with council to support us in terms of exploration of maybe some possible sites to explore our engagement with local community I 've recently been in nominated on a couple of boards multicultural New Zealand with the multi cultural centers to look at how we can support migrants and also their business as a reward and Catherine pizza 's here as well and I 'm also working housing those organizations and what we can do to help in the rebuild for our communities would be something which might be good to look at even if we study the feasibility any questions um Yanni um thanks thanks tests were coming back again and I think last time for one of the times that you came before obviously land in the central city it 's quite problematic for us as a city with youth we 've actually we don 't have a lot of the land that we used to have but we did ask whether you talk to Sarah or CCD you around opportunities for use of their land give them a day on a lot of land in the central city now has it been any progress on that unfortunately there 's been a few changes within the organization so perhaps redirecting that communication once again to the new entity might be a good way forward for us yeah I wonder whether I mean obviously we 're still just go put of a transition but maybe meeting with the crown code here but maybe that 's yeah absolutely absolutely at the moment we 've got about 15 who are coming to our current market but we have also talked to the Latin market and they have had some setback but definitely keen to collaborate and bring in more people into the city I was thinking that we also could look at the possibility of doing a little bit of greening around peterborough street on the actual site and also working along with the greening well with the gap filler site and using those two sides a little bit more collaboratively might be a good way to go not at all we 're very open today yeah so if it wasn 't exclusively an international market but the international market was a component of a bigger covered market absolutely that 's what we think as well as a community center yeah so we 've spoken to the department of internal but there are two different things right yeah they 're two different things one being very community to house organizations and activities dance whatever is needed in the city and the other one being more about small business good any other questions it 's fine um I know why Bucky 's raised that question so we 'll we 'll continue to look into that and I think that she 'll probably get on here um email child very quickly and grave yeah fantastic your hip good all right say oh the deputy mayor will be in touch wonderful thank you once again there and everyone here now wish you a wonderful morning and also great Christmas by the way we 'll invite you to the Christmas play at their rice church through pasta and so knock somebody so that 'll be good to have you there thank you once again except thank you very much thank you _"

    "text": "and so we now move to public dissipation and the public forum we commence with an introduction by Ross Butler as the new chair of crown co if you 'd like to come forward I should mention to everyone that crown co of course is a holding name the company itself will have a name at some stage in the future but for crown co it is the company will the Crown 's development companies similar to development Christchurch limited as the council 's crown co forms part of a triumph or it with regenerate crash each sitting at the top I 'm absolutely delighted with Ross 's appointment we know each other we go back quite a long way to a time when I was the Minister of Commerce and the New Zealand government and so it is great to see a Christchurch boy come home and and and make good in terms of the contribution that you can make to our city through this role so I 'd like to invite you to introduce yourself to the city of christchurch thank you thank you me and thank you you today I 'm excited about this role and I believe that I can help make a difference and and bring that level of trust and confidence that our people and our communities and our businesses are expecting of this new entity and the entities that will work alongside that they regenerate the CDL company and the council itself and all the agencies that flow from central and local government and from all the communities and the people of Christchurch and the wider Christchurch community so thank you for the opportunity this morning so I thought it might be useful of only have limited time but just a little bit of formal background so I 'm a Christchurch person born and bred went to uni here but then left and spent most of my life overseas and financial services and strategy acquisitions and mergers I came back and sort of retired about 10 or 12 years ago that 's when they took on some roles I 've taken on roles that are difficult and challenging and complex and I like working my way through with teams of people to get commitment so currently I share a range of commercial community and government entities i share my local polytech i live in nelson then i 'll be based here three or four days a week for at least the next three or four months as we get through the formation stages i cheer mercer at the funds management group in Australia and in New Zealand and they are a sizeable entity so we have quite substantial property direct and direct property holdings in the asia-pacific region so some of the challenges that will technically I 'll face us I 'm comfortable with I am a chair of the Maori Authority rang attorney and it 's some settlement treaty companies I 'm a member of the co Committee of the financial markets authority and I do have a little bit of business background with the earthquakes and that I was deputy chair of gns science for some time at particularly around the time of the earthquakes I 'm not a scientist by the way I failed in school certificate for science but I wasn 't there for my science skills so I episode that won 't be the name of the company it is a company so it 's a very different corporate beast from the organizations and entities that you 've been working with and alongside up until now as a company the responsibility for the outcomes of the company the responsibility of the board and it will be a lean board the process of appointment of the borders is working its way through the system at the moment they 'll be the board will be people who I think will immediately have yourselves and for community and business and Christchurch people saying looks like they mean business and in terms of looks like they mean business we 've appointed kill to be the support the unit leader for the formation of the company so over the next few months he 'll be working with me he brings an incredible degree of outcomes strategy attention to detail finishing things off he understands how Wellington works it was previously the chief exec of the Commerce Commission and other entities in Wellington he has worked alongside Auckland City Council and some of their fly on from there and the bigger city concept I worked alongside other developments which relate to technical and difficult situation so Nick that 's if you wouldn 't mind ur standing up so Nick will be we are joined at the hip and we are we have fantastic complementary skills he has got a track record as a sale of getting things done so I 'm really pleased that he 's agreed to to work with me and I think that 's a sign that we mean business as well first of all that someone as good as nick is prepared to take it on and secondly that that he 's able to do it and give almost time to it so he will be here full time i 'll probably be here four or five probably four days a week so ground codes accompany is it will deliver to find anchor projects so it 's the first objective of the company the first purpose those anchor projects you know the 17 that have been talked about for some time they are to this company will be working on the defining is a role of government and that process is going through at the moment so I can 't really say much more than that our other objectives we must work together with regenerate Christchurch towards regeneration goals and we must divest the defined crown land that has been acquired through the earthquake process so they are the crunchy purposes of the company so the anchor projects you all know that the various ones that convention center I can 't give you any detail about any more detail about what 's actually happening at the moment because this company has not been formed it would be presumptuous of me to to go into the detail of negotiations but I am acutely aware of what 's being said day by day by the community by people by business in the media and so on so of their pictorial form of the various some graphic images of what some of our anchor projects reply so but these don 't really say the whole picture because they are very technical they 're building so crown co will have a role in terms technical things that these projects have to do but it 's the people stuff around the outside that I am acutely aware of all the outcomes for our communities and our people so my role as as the chair of this new entity is to work alongside Sarah as you are aware Sarah and the legislation that backs it up complete their role we 're not complete their role but as an entity they finished in april so they are going through a transition so that the Sarah the establishes and April it 's important with crown code that it 's not a transition out of Sarah and a transition into crown code because that then has that concept of there 's a gap in the middle somewhere so I 'm actually working actively with with Sarah people at the moment I 'm providing some support and assistance and some areas so even though I have no formal role I think I want that process to be seamless and effective to rev up a bit so that 's working really well I 'm helping to design that the crown co that will be around the organization the structure the people the capital structure getting ourselves ready to go once the the legislation is through will have a chief executive as I say minimum board will one of my roles at the moment is making recommendations about the nature of assets activities and resources so that when we go through this definition process that that 's a comfortable process and I 've committed to liaising mayor and councillors with with your council so we talked on several occasions already about my preparedness to meet with the council in any way and with regenerate and work alongside regenerate and CDL so I talked about Nick in his role and and his responsibilities talked about his background so I 'm probably taking up your time there we are going through some internal discussions with people at the moment about how they can help that the formation of of crown code and I 'm particularly excited to see share an idea coming back because that that was really where most of the stuff started so sure an idea with 105 or whatever it was so to call them that but little to it abs weird clouds yeah work outside yeah but it 's but that was the basis of what people wanted and that was their dream their vision and what these words mean different things to different people we talked before about prosperity prosperity and a prosperous city actually means different things to different people but across that spectrum of what things like a prosperous city means will will want that for the city so crown co will help to to make certain that those those dreams and those aspirations by the people of Christchurch and the wider Christchurch community and the businesses and the communities that live within it will be achieved so um mere I really as a council I can 't say much more than that I 'm not empowered to do any more than that um but I hope you get a sense of ownership and urgency and commitment and collaboration I mean I just think that those words that sense of urgency and collaboration because I think the two of them together actually will make our city all I just took a photo a screenshot of that because the words that stand out the most i 've seen this weird cloud but in a different way but green and people people and grow you know these these are the two top features of all of the word clouds that were done out of Sharon idea and that you know that sense of sustainability the sense of community the sense of excitement the sense of unique the sense of vibrancy this one managed to get resilience and much of course is one of my favorite words but not many others accessible you know but new bustling inspirational creative visionary you know that these words are they really do speak to the future of our city so I certainly have great confidence works with collaboration though so the urgency goes with collaboration at some speed tempered by deliberation it 's great thank you thanks man and thanks the honor Council so it 's anyone got a quick question that they 'd like to ask Johnny thank you and thank you for the presentation um just when you 're looking at code um you 've talked about the anchor projects which is obviously generate central city focus do you have a role wider than just for central city know that I think the scope of the project 's themselves are pretty well known and they 're all where they are and what they 're doing so apart from those projects and and the issues around the land that the crown owns at the moment which must be paddled the mix apart from that night so I think Ross said that he was waiting for the crown to say what the defined as its anchor projects we rafted you have a question ok thank you Tim and I just want to say thank you you know we counsel one of the first cabs or the block that is coming seen an engagement and their collaboration to assist expediency in the delivery is absolutely essential so I think we 're all going to work to give it give me the right way to go so thank you Thank You castle excited gleam last one Thank You Indies about ask you a question which my cue to say a question of ourselves that in terms of the kind of community emotional bank account what do you think it 's going to take to put sufficient credits in there to overtake any divots over yes we 've seen this it 's been promised and look the council 's guilty if this at times as well but how do you think we can you know overcome that the deficits to actually get into the into their credit zone deliver get some substantial seeing contracts signed and out there in the in the public place so that communities and people and businesses can make decisions about investment and how other activities around the anchor projects will take place so I think some delivery yeah excellent look and I get counsel I get this issue around trust and confidence at the end of the day if it 's any consolation we 're the same we have to get a spade in it qe2 yeah you know the community will see it once they believe it yeah and I think that 's it 's a really good note to all in this together so look thank you so much i think this is just such a powerful and strong beginning to our relationship and we really look forward to a very open and collaborative working arrangement with you regenerate christchurch and development christchurch limited all working together and a collaboration with the council and the other agencies but most importantly with the community because it 's the people that are at the heart of us so thank you very much thank you me thanks for your time count have a good meeting and I 'll forward to working together with you all thank you thank you _"

    "text": "hell yep I think this is actually a really important part of our decision-making it 's kind of like at the tap the tail end but in fact we 're talking about having two additional committee board members out of the whole representation for the city and we heard really clearly from banks peninsula people how important it was that they not be left out that they not be isolated and they deserve in my view the best representation and I think to kind of like kept have to and that have to and board members and me on Herbert until in Littleton really just it leads to an unequal voting situation at times potentially for the banks peninsula community board and I don 't believe here council should set it up this way it 's it because in many ways thanks Peninsula as a special case because of it because of its rural area and end the wide range of distinct small rural communities so yeah and I think that having I would just want to reiterate having a larger number of board members in one area or like would lead to an imbalance and I strongly urge all councillors to really consider that put the increase in the number of the total number of community board members for air city by simply to thank you and turn one of the things that 's been spoken to us about fair representation and a free look at the options if there are indeed two members for echo and wherever they 'll be representing in Y over 550 people H and my ward Kashmir with each community board member will be representing 10,500 I when we talk about communities we don 't just talk about what 's in front of our front door we talk about those communities that are connected to our communities I talked a while ago about patchworks of communities whether some whatever their community is made up of and how that 's made of they all connect to make your city you don 't just suddenly have a lot and you don 't go over there we all work across lines and these so-called wards and subdivisions so I think there 's a bit of mutual respect are grateful that I Vicki say that all of the arguments that have been put forward for banks peninsula having this degree of representation could be used in any other part of the city for example rural areas there are rural areas on your toast and all sorts of areas as you well third when the rural voting came up and there are remote areas for example templeton which sits right at the edge of the city some of which is actually in the Selwyn district population 2006 at the moment that could conceivably decide that it wanted its own entire community board and end area if we decided that the same rules as banks peninsula profit and applied the population increase in some areas is larger than the entire area of some of these Ward 's workaround for example has had a larger population increase them the entire population of why we were I cannot get an i agree with Tim completely I cannot get with the idea that 549 people of whom presumably about fifty percent vote actually elect a community board member and I can 't get so remote that somehow area and remoteness comes into how you vote because no matter how you look at it it 's the old country quota and that we finally got rid of I think about I don 't know 1949 or something in New Zealand so I cannot get with on this side 10,000 people elect a community board on this side 549 electron I just cannot see how that works all right so look regardless of which ever one we end up with we will also have to actually note that that within the within the subdivisions there are there outside the plus or minus ten percent as well so we can get some wording and there but Andrew you 've already spoken question question we just hit the debate sir okay so it yeah it is a process question what are we responding to if this amendment is carried we went out with a proposal for to community bullets hi we heard from submitters that came principally from the a corolla subdivision who said that they didn 't want to lose the level of renovation made this all read in chose not to put we were recommended not to put forward an issue because there was no supporting information where 's the supporting information for reducing a Corot as representations one community board member because it 's different the proposal and nobody came to as saying reduce the level of community the proposal that we went out with included a wide award so it actually went over the hill and to and to some the proposal for a corolla was to elected members and the proposal for why raila was to elected members in the context of 101 but in the community board we 're allowed to take into cost considerations into account we 're allowed to take into different considerations then we are with the wards i said that before i think that it 's kind of like it 's not that you have to show that there 's the yeah to amend the particular recommendation we went out with we do have to take into account the submissions we did that by changing the parameters of the ward by retaining the ward as banks peninsula look I think the easiest way is to accept councillor mangies amendment as an amendment to the to the top one which is to replace the 12 community board members for ocurro my real with one each and that 's them that 's the amendment so i 'll put the amendment first and if the amendment is carried then the substantive motion becomes that motion but with one each for agora Marya if it is lost then i 'll put the substantive motion which is that there are two each all right so i 'll put the amendment first which is that that of that so we 're amending the resolution so that it would read one community board member elected from each of the corolla my rear were subdivisions and two each from Mount Erebus and littles and subdivisions so i 'll put that amendment all those in favor oh hang on book mutters we 'll have a vote so can you put the voting system so those in favor those in favor put your hand up of the amendment 1 2 3 4 5 6 and those opposed so there is carried lost sorry that 's that 's lost so we go back to the to the motion that 's moved by Councillor tuna counselor clearwater so who 's lost sorry yeah no I counted a David voted for the against the amendment so the the actual motion now is that there be four separate subdivisions with two community board members elected from each subdivision so i 'll put that motion now I 'm not voting on any of these I 'm only said that right from the very start so I voted on community board none numbers that was all no it 's not it 's it 's actually whether there be four subdivisions yes it includes numbers but I 'm not voting on subdivisions with on wards can those in favor put up your hand 123456 and those opposed one two three four five six six seven so that puts us in a very odd position because no all David vote David change this photos so yeah but yeah but it has created initially so what that means is do we now have to notify the I don 't know how we had how do we what about 212 to try that see that see if that gets in find out what that is going to vote for so what are you get about full days alright so the net well yeah i think the original proposal was to community boards subdivision so we 'll just have to leave it there was a to complete community to but the community board members pure subdivision okay that was at the original debt suppose efficient yeah oh I mean this sea city yeah i know it 'swork we 've made one board but that 's what we went out and and and and the initial proposal was that there were two in each subdivision so i think that that 's probably the closest to the proposal we went out to a corolla and why we were with what it was maybe two from each and that really is the issue we do all night cuz we had little to the Summoner actually we didn 't have littleton mount Herbert yeah so it isn 't exactly the same and 'm actually wondering whether we have well David should have voted against the it should have voted in favor of the First Amendment so we 're now saying that he 'll be two elected from no I 'm now questioning my own ruling on the matter the reason is is that the original proposal that we went out with had Littleton Sumner and it was to each and we can 't we can 't_''_711.65 Ridley we can 't readily resolve that yeah yeah ok mean months says that had one substantive and an amendment we would have been fine at what its default we only had one amendment if David had voted for the amendment then we would have had that resolved but I 'm going to roll now that the that the notification will be in line with the intent of the of the notification that we went out with initially and that we will notify to elected from each of the subdivisions all right yes yes we does oh I see because that one will be known as a bit of one community with subdivisions but we haven _''_777.22 okay so what we didn 't identify how many subdivisions there would be so for subdivision Jimmy in this moment that ok ok so could could could counsel a tuna and counselor Clearwater please move that there be four separate subdivisions occur oly real amount hooba son little son right I 'll put that motion no as opposed to know subdivisions we 've already we 've already established that there will be subdivisions but we didn 't say what they were so that there be four separate subdivisions and they be utter oly real amount Herbert in littleton i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no put up your hand for no one two three right okay so we 've got four subdivisions and the question is all right it 's probably just easier for meetin okay yes I know but the question is how many representatives on each subdivision so I 'm yeah yeah so I 'm just going to roll on to its the different subdivisions that 's the trouble so okay we 'll roll on to so we will notify I 'm wanting to poke on which will wind up on the south now we 've got we don 't need to break for morning tea because we 're very close to finishing hey no we 've got a couple more resolutions we 've just have to instruct our staff to notify we have no formal resolution around the numbers for the peninsula because I know I I don 't see how we can actually send initial proposals that what LGC or a proposal without a specific vote on the numbers so we can 't_''_955.56 do that if we weed I mean I think we have to try and get some resolute formal resolution throw around the numbers the two per would so that 's what we just voted against it but we don 't we don 't have we don 't have a circuit breaker well what I was going to suggest some people might hate us or they might like it was that we went to a Corral one way we were into littleton and to not Herbert so you actually reduce it by one so the debate seven as a middle ground because the population ratio for why real was seen to be the thing that people were most concerned about what wyd yet given the position room why don 't we just simply moved at the numbers for the committee board members be as follow the original proposal but the trouble is there it doesn 't follow the initial proposal because it included some nut well link would be it 's a compromise I 'm in the fitness but why original discussion was that you 're going to have people foot you know groupies in five hundred footing on All Right see that so the one of the other idea yeah well I mean the default position is to talk possession with submit well you know we don 't excuse me we where did we get to in terms of the numbers on the boat it was can I suggest that we go with what your knees suggesting I 'm happy I 'm global posts and hopefully I 'm just like it isn 't a businessman I 'll vote for a bit at the moment I a deal but that won 't stop us moving forward so I 'm happy to go with your 21 22 just to get something on on the table every port so it 's the one by River that a Corral stays of two why Rio reduces from two to one and that Littleton stays up two and Mahela stays up to so you basically it 's reflecting the concern that 's been expressed its very the debate and it 's rigid and basically the only difference between the amendment and the original resolution was a choice between six or eight so it just runs up to seven in the area that has the highest ratio representation gets reduced and half which is a river so proposal is lost where does that leave us then no no let 's not go if there would someone like to move there as an amendment four thousand that 's right Yanni you 'd like to move that up and seconded by pauline so i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no so so who 's opposed 1 ok so so let 's just that those in favor those in favor of this amendment 1 2 3 4 5 6 all right that 's carried okay okay put your hand up if you are supporting this compromise to 12 to one two three four five six seven eight yeah right so that 's that 's carried and those opposed put up your hands well we 're right down those opposed Andrew tum Dave and Jamie right that 's carried okay so we and we need to move and seek and so I 'll move and I 'm sure Bucky all second that we 're noting that the population of the bank 's financial community board members represent is outside the plus or minus ten percent I 'll put there all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried and all it Jonnie move and who would like to second that we resolve to instruct staff to notify the council 's final proposal Yanni and term we 're just noting us yeah yeah can we just conclude is this the final resolution yes and then good play tips yes yeah okay um well I mean we 're clean through a pretty extensive process I know these things in here that concern people i know that some people in the community will obviously go to the local girl commission and make submissions that 's part of this process so you know i 'm expecting that there will be some changes through through the next stage of the process but i think it 's really good that council has worked through early engagement formal consultation and come up with a proposal that 's tried to capture the different competing elements of what 's been raised and as i said i mean it 's not the perfect proposal you 'll never actually get a perfect proposal in the city the size of christchurch with the that 's award being the way it is so you know i do want to place on record that we have been through a very very extensive process around this i think there has been a lot of work by staff to really try to understand what people have been saying and try I do want to place on record my my thanks to the staff we had to go through this this was part of something by law that we had to do and I actually think even though people may not be happy with everything and it but actually I do think it has been a good process so i just wanted to place on record my support for putting us through as the final proposal and they are now enabling it to proceed to the next step but i just think inclusion which to say I think it 's really important that the public in communities make submissions to the local government Commission if they support this proposal or if they have concerns and then don 't miss the opportunity I think it 's really critical we learned last time that the local government Commission will weigh up a number of different factors the key thing is the community also need to be engaged extensively in that process so that we get the best outcome for the city to reflect their desires and I just want to make that night was just the process beyond here and the timelines beyond here but it can be after Jamie 's Christian I know it 's a bit of a tick tick LT I 'm speaking to it here but um no I 'm not going to vote in favor of resolving to instruct staff notify the council 's final proposal because because with respect dear I say it and I really challenge anyone around this room to look you in the eye and tell me what that final proposal is we 've set around here voting time and time again in my opinion on these things I don 't even know half the stuff that we 've come up with in it I don 't know actually how many so you 've got to okay so we agree to compromise was to foreca are 14 why rira for instance to firm out here the two forum littleton at the end of goodness knows how many votes and amendments and everything you know in a Corral with is was at 1800 people were saying the other they 're going to to community board 's 1000 year countdown film there 's one pipe down there 's 1000 then and why rira it 's very very little numbers of actually residents there and you 've got double the size community board I just honestly in my heart of hearts don 't believe that we 're going to be coming up with something that better represents people or all the people that we 're actually here to serve because I 'm an idealist it means it 's higher end for council because I want what Christ which should be a better place I want to help contribute to that and I understand this ribs up representation reviewers as a part of that I just don 't feel that we 've really got their stuff done a heck of a lot of work I appreciate that it 's a completely thankless role because there is no right answer to all of us that they are outstanding we 're very lucky with the stuff that we 've got but I just don 't believe that the necessary had the best of stuff to work with I remember one were there two of which were recidivist offenders that went round to all of them and two were effectively shoulder tap 22 headlong and and and and have a chat there the submissions process was the response was under well when we had three times more submissions on a Wendy 's liquor license than what we actually had on the entire representation review the splitting up of the subdivisions or the wards and then having elected councillors for them i don 't think that differentiates the role between community board member in count store enough i don 't actually believe that that there is any reason that a resident would bring a community board member over the counselor for their ward when they 're both elected on the same ballot paper and it means that the grassroots issues that community boards are supposed to tackle quite literally sometimes are going to the counselors which i think is a great strategic use not having them mixed me in the wards i feel that it lacks that strategic oversight so there isn 't it sharing quite often of different political views of bring the awards were than with the subdivisions within the award together and help create that sort of holistic oversight to try and see see the big picture over the sort of the pet patch protection type things so I think daresay that became quite an ad hoc process that I don 't actually think leaves Christchurch better off as a result of it you know I think I know that since the last census I 've moved twice since then a lot of people their lives have been up in the air we 've had data based I know it 's not a perfect world but based on census that 's a few years old we 've got a census next year and i think that people have settled down probably a lot more in the wake of the earthquake and we 're into regeneration more than immediate recovery and i think there could be better since and potentially having an more up-to-date information and a new council that isn 't a feat of the own to election making the school the reality is we had less than a room is that a lot of elected members the most productive people in the city on this you know drive the process and ever so close to an election we 're debating whether we asked after notifies the council 's final hosel we 're not debating the merits of the number of council ok Ward the wards well it 's the fellas it 's the final cycle cheering the meeting thank you carry on thank you and um yes but i 'll right i 'll wrap this up in the sense that i just i just don 't think that this is necessary going to take Christ reach forward through no folder anyone 's but just just how the process has been so I 'm I don 't sport instructing the staff to notify this because I think it 's very convoluted what we notifying and like I 've CGR I would favor quality over quantity any day of the week and I just don 't think that we 're necessary in better representation or better quality will beat or anything out of us so you know I 'm sorry but I just I just don 't back where we 're at yep I 'm Phil I have to say that you know it certainly want to start by saying it 's not the stars fault that in fact the process is complicated and and it 's also up to us to go carefully through the papers and it is it is complex and it 's been challenging but I think it 's really important that in fact we do pass this because if we don 't and some counters may have wondered why counsel your hands and drew attention to it in fact we won 't be following the law as a local territory authority and what will report what we actually leaked it to do we 're addicted to make some decisions and some of them are hard and this hasn 't been easy that the fallback position is yeah we if we don 't do it the Commission will make all the decisions and that hasn 't been at all what this process has been about in fact it 's been a it 's been a carefully people initially engaged and its really would be really wrong if we dismiss there and ignore that or minimize their in any way I think it 's quite ironic than effect on one hand we we as a council and say look we won 't involve more people at election time and end in their local and it with their local community boards if if we don 't listen to what they did say what they said through that engagement and what the number people who did make submissions what they see it very coherently and really almost spoke as one in terms of how they wanted their community boards and counsel to be so I strongly strongly recommend that we resolve that last this last recommendation and clean David Andrew thank you this whole task which we 've been given to respond to has been based around the principles of fair and effective representation if we look at the proposed maps for the wards every community and the city is representing we 've been living at a time post-quake where many have felt disenfranchised you could say the seismic people palace and and subsequent actions and events have as well if you look at that map every part of the city is guaranteed to be represented I think of something that Vicki said early on that some time ago when a council was elected at large in the city they mostly came from a certain part of the city and yet they were elected to act in the interest of the whole city despite not physically representing parts of the city 's you could never guaranteed some of the smaller voices were heard and that 's what I like about this the equitable ax t about the representation across the city in a sense going back to that one person one vote principle one community of interest one vote principle here based on their communities of interest I 'm very much in favor of this and I urge you to support it David look thank you we are required for legislation to review our representation every six years and and we have done that and it is quite significant and in there metropolitan area that our representation is compounded 's probably the one thing that I did to agree in the whole process that banks peninsula remained as a separate identity and as it is now however i think our thinking is probably being cleared at around the whole trying to fit banks peninsula into the city yes or no the rest of the city and my mind 's been functioning read reasonably well so i didn 't have a lot of support for changing the rest of the city i did have a lot of support for leaving banks peninsula as this i do have like Jamie identified some concerns around the the level of response to our consultation 196 correct me if I 'm not exactly right submissions and it 's Jamie 's point of that we 've had probably three times that over a liquor license and to be then sort of trumpeting that the the people of Christchurch have signified that we need extra counselors we need to review our community board representation it 's a somewhat flimsy i would suggest on 196 people making a submission i went to a number of the community staff almost outnumbered the number of people that were there so i 'm not going to vote for the last resolution either i would have much preferred that we adopted a more conservative approach to things and i think in the long term we need to look very seriously at our style of consultation because effectively the silent majority don 't bother and maybe that 's a reflection that they 're comfortable with the way things are but to have such a low turnout for representation to me doesn 't sort of signify the need for a lot of change entry thank you um yeah I certainly support the notification as proposed I 'd like to start by commending the excellent process that we 've been through and the excellent work that staff have done I also attended a number of the early community engagement meetings and I think it 's important to note that yes we may have only had 196 formal submissions to this process but there were far more people engaged particularly early in the process and that actually helped to draw out the issues that have that we 've had as we 've moved through the process so in focusing on the number of written submissions we received my view is that there were a far larger number of people that were engaged early in the process who quite possibly didn 't feel the need to make a written submission because they felt they 'd already had their say and they 'd have their input into the process I 'd also like to acknowledge that the bank 's peninsular issue has in many ways been one of the defining factors of the debate and has been one of the the problems that we 've been seeking to solve the peninsular arrangements have certainly been acknowledged through submissions and debaters as working well in terms of the current arrangements we 've had plenty of opportunity to discuss the isolation issues the diversity of the community and the connection between those communities as opposed to connection across the hills and into the city and we heard that from both the peninsula and those areas which were proposed to be combined with the peninsula so in summary in terms we 've acknowledged that one size does not fit all and there are different parts of the city that that have different attributes that in order to achieve fair and effective representation have needed to be dealt with differently and that 's one of the reasons that I 'm strongly supportive of the MMP adoption of the proposal to me I support today 's the final decision to notify because wider and we are aware actually if we commence from the pre consultation I was back to learn more than six month ago we went to all the places that 's open transparent overall the process even this the decision is you know there is how to make a leader councillor happy but additional with respect we go through all those the process open and transparent another one is because we review this kind of the drop for the proposal and also we based on the local government come in the act actually is to see the kind of the items we need to aware the first ones community of interest second wines of fair representation so one is a this way and also sula a pre consultation and also solar retransmission as well so all always amiss we 'll all listen to all those the submitters so that my view is that this is the final decision even you are happier you are not happy we we have to respect this decision we cannot insist on our original whole interview because when these are all the culprit accommodate decision otherwise we steer you know insist on our original the point of view opinion I don 't think so that 's a good benefit to our city to other community I don 't think but at least we have done our best we listened to the people with review all those the document in the summation so I urge all our consular innovation is when we go to the notified to the public thank you thank you well I 'll just um I 'm going to oh sorry oh ok i just want a personal thank stuff i 've done an actually still a job i have to say i know it 's been really really difficult and you 've know people out and engage in this process and i know it hasn 't been easy with that said i will be voting against the recommendation to proceed with the final proposal and my reasons being is that i listen to a lot of people coming in to submit and they talked about how they were really happy with the way the ring represented right at the moment they were concerned that any shift could change that and and to me that sort of struck a chord here we are we 're we 're going out to bet for banks peninsula to be left as it is and to me i 'd much rather see us go back for christchurch and leave Christ your tears including been Spanish work and my reasoning for that is it has been raised by couple other members here today is it the populations are shifting as we speak people aren 't where they want to be right at the moment they 're in and out of their houses with EQC repairs and insurance repairs we 've seen populations moving to different parts of the process takes place when people 's houses get finished we see me going on the market and are moving and I think of the next year or two we 're going to see some significant changes and how that lands will be will be interesting but with that I think we should actually go out and back for Christchurch and say leave us alone I think we 've gone through a really good process and I think the resolution should be that we 've gone through those prices and we we see that things are quite good as they are and people are feeling well represented thank you Oh Pauline I just don 't think it 's an option not to support this motion we need to put something forward all this week we 've done it 's been really good debate things are not actually okay the way they are the way beyond the tolerable percentage marks that the populations are asked you and you know I think that we 've had good debate there 's going to be no perfect solution probably either where everybody is happy I support all the comments about the staffs work and I think people have engaged really well was this so I will be supporting it thank you well look I 've allowed a broad debate here because I think it is important in the closure for this process that we we do that we actually have no legal alternative other than to notify we have a final proposal and we will notify it so in many respects we should just simply be noting that that staff will notify the council 's final proposal but it does give us a debating point because I know that there were counselors that wanted to make other points and I think it is justified that that we do so I think it is very challenging to do a representation review with our city still in a state of flux and men respects and there are new subdivisions being created there are there are real issues that we have to confront and you know the banks peninsula side of things is really what pushes us into the representation review requirements and actually meant that we had 't an ideal option I do support the retention of the bank 's financial award but it is a bigger issue about how you combine a large urban city council with a small district council and I don 't believe that as a country we 've actually done that very well and so agreements are entered into we 're by banks Ventura 's welcome done to Christchurch City well actually crushed it said he voted against banks financial adjoining them and a reorganization was done through a different process to get around the fact that crush ditch that he didn 't want to merge so and voted against it and the referendum so I think that we should reflect on what that means and end why a small district council would want to merge with a urban council if they can 't actually have proper representation so I think it 's a bigger issue it 's not just for Christchurch and banks furniture it 's for any large urban city that is going to merge with other districts I 've got a series of answers to the questions that deputy process from here on so we are legally required to notify our representation or proposed final proposal for representation arrangements within six weeks after the end of the period allowed for the making of submissions this is under section 19 in of the local electoral act 2001 and that means that we have to notify this proposal no later than Friday of this week the twentieth of November 2004 Dean hence the requirement to have this meeting today under the local electro act we 're required to provide reasons for any amendments to our initial proposal and any amendments can only be made in the light of submissions which is what we 've done today we 're very carefully structured the debate around all of the changes that we 've proposed in relation to the submissions that we 've received so and and we 're also required to indicate reasons for the rejection of any submission and we we did reject the submission that we did receive we did receive a submission more than one submissions suggesting that we retained the current boundaries for the whole city it wasn 't whole but legally we didn 't have the ability to go out with that as a proposition and it would really only be an exception to the legal framework that we have under the local electroweak that that would be allowed so we haven 't_''_2674.19 we haven 't put that up as a proposal but only because there is no legal basis for it and as I 've said on more than one occasion I personally have a preference for that option it seems to me that to allow this to run for another three years although I will correct something that I said earlier which is the next census isn 't until 2018 which means that we couldn 't rely on it for a representation review until 2020 one so that does make a slight change I think that there are some of the groupings of the wards that people have made today is very interesting because they reflect the existing wards in a way that they didn 't perhaps before and as somebody else said you 've just got three names representing the same ward that is represented why I 've stayed out of the debate on the numbers on the on the groupings of wards because really it 's the grassroots counselors that understand the communities of interest better then I ever will the public notice is going to specify the bright of submissions submitters to appeal councils final decision if the if the initial proposal was confirmed but we 're not confirming the original proposal so there is also a right of any interested individual organization to object to the final decision efforts mended in any way so anyone has the ability who has an interest and thus to object to the council 's final decision and the closing date for the receipt of appeals or objections must not be earlier than one month after the date of the publication of the public notice so we notify by Friday we 've we then allow at least a month for objections and appeals and those are then referred to the local government Commission for the determination so we do not consider them we receive them and we send them to the local government commission but the we you would that nobody objected to anything that we have decided for the final proposal imagine if that happened we would still have to refer it to the local government commission for a determination anyway and the reason we would have to refer it was because we 've reached the threshold and banks peninsula so that 's the reason we would be referring it so it 's going to end up in the local government Commission they will have hearings and februari I believe january-february and then and then they are required by law to issue a determination no later than the 11th of April 2016 so and at that point there are only appeals and judicial review on points of law so at that point it 's pretty much pretty much decided so 16th of April sorry the 11th of April 2016 we all know what the boundaries are so I the local government Commission will come to Christ Church as i understand it for the hearings and then obviously we will be invited to present to the hearing to the local government Commission as part of that process a technicality it 's to allow those that want to show their opposition to the to the framework that has been determined but in many respects as a symbolic of that position rather than actual so i 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried can we have a division the Pearson effect for that last verse division scandal yes Amir yes Turner yes is absolutely no cuz we got no yes thank you very much that 's carried all right so thank you very much for all your hard work and I now declare the meeting closed thank you _"

    "text": "in front of you apart from the misspelling of the word representation at the top see the first one 2.1 and the written document that you have in front of you it talks about adopting the report and the and including the recommendations and reasons we 've taken out the words and recommendations because we 're obviously going to have a debate around the recommendations but for the reasons that for the amendments to the initial proposal and for any rejection of submissions that 's the that sort of kind of the initial thing and then it 's the initial proposal confirmation of electing a mere and 16 councillors confirming its initial proposal that members other than the mere be elected by electors of wards rather than by the electors of the district as a whole at large confirming its initial proposal that one member be elected by the electors of each Ward and then we get to the resolution that the city be divided into 16 Ward 's with their boundaries they set out below now I think that we 're pretty much pretty much straight forward on all picture 2.6 underneath the description of the wards you 've got resolved that the changes to the ward boundaries from the initial proposal better reflect communities of interest and resolve to adopt the names of the adopt the names of the boards and its initial proposal subject to the following amendment so that changes the names of the ward and then a noting provision in relation to the numbers of each members of population that each member will represent in 2.9 as resolving that in accordance with what the provisions of the electroweak the it 's only the bank 's financial award that doesn 't meet the plus or minus ten percent and resolve that the council recommends to the local government commission that the bank 's furniture award now I think that we 're pretty much clear cut as to whether people support or don 't support sort of 12 to two point eight and I think that we could put two point nine or two point 10 together because that 's the bank 's furniture 1 i 'm just mindful of you know those that want to not initial proposal that there are communities and community boards confirm its initial proposal to abolish the communities resolve that community board comprises elected members elected from subdivisions agree to the arrangement based on right so and then we have to agree on that so so i think that what we could do is we could do all of the recommendations 2.1 to 2.2 dean minus 2.9 and to point 10 and then we 'll deal with 2.9 and to point 10 separately and then because that 's the banks peninsula deference Oh Jamie yeah that 's just a question of clarification um I just note I was under the impression that the community board areas for example halls will be record and I was of the understanding that was what the ward is that 's it though no no no no the warders the counselor election areas with the suit each Ward their subdivisions of the community board area that 's not the ward the subdivision is the ward right yeah so a community board is made up of three wards which act as subdivisions of the community board area okay so okay so we will do two point nine and two point 10 first so would someone like to move to point nine and two point 10 because obviously they reflect on the rest so and removed seconded Pauline is there any discussion about that yeah well well hang on no jaani jaani wants to discuss it no voting in cities I know just I mean I just wanted to just reiterate um that we 've had this debate through the hearing so I don 't think there 's any point in just going through really getting all the arguments that we 've already had so yeah I 'm gonna vote for it I just want to explain why I 'm not going to speak to it I wasn 't just to say that we 've already had isn 't it ironic well I mean you know but I think it 's important for people to understand why we 're not having a big debate about it yeah okay it goes by thank you so i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say hand just for the nose Vicki back Jamie golf so to point to point 1 through 22 point 15 would someone like to move those sorry I don 't want to be niggly there are some in there that I agree with in some that I don 't um but what which ones flow on from from each other so you 're going to point one just so I can identify which ones I agree with them which ones I don 't you you 're trying wanting to move well they 're all connected and well you see only thing between 2.1 + 2.5 don 't you have an issue a-- uh yes all of them are from 2.3 which has confirm its initial proposal that the Christchurch City Council members are elected be elected by the wards rather than the electors of a district as a whole quite large so there 's I mean I 'm gonna stop us from can you move 2.3 can you you can visit much yeah that 's why I agree with that so I confirm that the initial proposal that you elect the at large yeah that 's what that says yeah just the current status pro yeah and that 's what we 're proposing going forward and I agree with that yeah everything else I disagree ok so 2 points3 would you like to move 2.3 separately 2.3 moves second to pull I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried so 2.1 to 2.2 15 someone like we 've already put a mover and seconder for that head we know okay someone like to move that Phil seconded Pauline I 'll put that motion just in terms of the board names was just I know we 've got some proposed changes in 2.7 so this one outlines these changes yeah no I understand that I was just going to suggest that I 'm fight for the lynnwood one that it 'd be better reflected as a hyphenated limmud Walston so I was just I thought we had a principle that we work in a name areas after specific suburbs when they covered a wider area but the changes that were being asked had a lot of confusion over here over the years whether there 's any opportunity just to just to amend well that 's it Linwood was an existing there was an existent name was enough we 've read the report carefully and generally accepted that I think with our suggesting changes prior to this and I just think that if we start making changes now it will add it will just lead to confusion so I I just support 2.7 as it is yeah but a well they 're probably the easiest way if you 'd like to move an amendment and then we 'll see if there 's a seconder for it and obviously I couldn 't move this while you had a ward called Worcester which wasn 't actually the worse award but my view that if you look at the heart of that lynnwood no no if you move in ammendment we 'll see if there 's a seconder for everyone so um I just moved that the limb would would be renamed the limud Walston board is there a seconder for their there are some so the ones that we 've already passed and is to it with a net one at the end battalion which I agree with about the restaurant so two point 11 as you confirm their communities and community boards in Christchurch City absolutely fine totally agree with there in two points 15 agreed as the e can be authorized to make minor Corrections that 's the material one logical so I 'm fine with that that 's not thought so we 'll we 'll do two point okay so we 'll change this one to 2.1 to 2.8 which is all of the ones that we haven 't done so far and then we 'll get to two point 11 and 11 doing so Dean okay so 2.1 to 2.8 i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no no hands up for no golf mangie lonsdale the next emotions would someone like to move to point 11 22 point 15 it 's not too that it 's just to point 11 and 2 point 15 well can 't_''_650.91 to point 11 and 2 point type resolutions so I have no problem with them ok to pointed living on to point 15 Jamie moved seconded by Paul put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried to point 12 to two point 14 someone like to move Tim seeking to Glenn I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no no it 's carried our hands up for no golf mangie lonsdale so we 've got now we move on to the options for the community board arrangements which was the hearings panel considered for options for communities community boards based on the submissions received the panel referred the decision to the council to resolve and these are the options that that we considered so it 's up to us to to make that decision I have been asked to remind counselors that because obviously there will be a debate around this it is really important to understand that the proposal that went out can only be amended by US based on the submissions that we received so referring to any emails in determining the position that you might adopt on this would actually be put at risk and make a subject to judicial review so are just making that point as I said to you last week I 'm not going to vote on this I am elected at large for the entire city and the mirror is always in that position Anna ters really the community representatives the counselors who are elected in those areas who understand the communities of interest much better than then I will so so I 'm I 'm literally the staying out of this particular vote and will abstain and will have my abstention recorded but not for any reason other then I feel that the best decision will be made by the by the counselors in terms of communities of interest because there has to be the focus I 've also received a note that there 's another option that that wants to be wants to be proposed and so I don 't know whether we get that one rush on that because I presume that 's one that you want to move yeah 's an amendment to option two so yes yeah so there are two there are two essential decisions to be taken around the community board arrangement one is the the cluster of wards that make up the community board area and the second is the number of community board members that each of those wards have I know that I 've had some feedback around the numbers on the banks peninsula Ward being very much out of kilter with the rest of the the city when we 're looking at that but also whether there should be you know obviously when there 's went when they 're with it whether there should be two or three community board members representing the different subdivisions so if I could so we 've got a an amendment to two option two which is being moved by Andrew and second does by put up the ml and services yet so Phil you 're aware of what I 'm closing yeah and so I think that there are two different issues so let 's have a general discussion and perhaps if someone wants to propose to foreshadow an alternative to this one I mean if there isn 't of foreshadowing and above an alternate have been I think what this is the one that we 're going to be debating so we 'll have the discussion first of all around the groupings of the wards yeah so what this does in terms of option to as it moves Heathcott from the lynnwood central from from sprayed and kashmir heathkit and to learn with central heath cuts so it moves Heathcott as award from the Spade sprayed and Kashmir grouping and to the lynnwood central grouping all right so is there any discussion on that ask a question sorry just didn 't roping I 'm just in terms of the community board elections as I understand it property owners in the ward can vote for community board members not councillors if they just own property so in the ward of their residents they can vote for the counselor and the community board members but strangely if you owe own more property you can vote for community board members and another ward as well so you can little role so you can only vote for one councillor and you can if your own property you can choose which counselor which would you vote on and I 'll just doing my thing in a few own property in a number of community board areas you can also select a counselor and each of those but you can 't vote five times in one can get your board area the only vote once so sorry so if you own property in sprayed and and your own some and say banks peninsula so people own a holiday house on the peninsula they vote for their counselor and spread and Kashmir and the community board there can they also vote for so they effectively can vote for two areas of the city because of their property holdings only for the community board so I 'm just wondering how we feel about that and we made any submission on that and are we able to not have because it does seem bizarrely sort of weird that the number of properties owned properties that you own me that you can vote in each 's been the case since the law was changed to allow for property ownership to be the basis of ratings to be the basis for voting it used to be ratepayers only so it was reign of how you had one note that you 're a player yes I understand it but they 're million years ago but the laws change since then but we still have this thing that the more properties you own the more community boards you can vote for it that 's right should we say that we think those days they 're sort of we need to raise that with the government not with the local government with machines in for this amendment the lamp or committed for should be you 53 rather than 15 wife the proper spelling mistake 50 sweet okay good so so we 've got two separate issues to deal with festivals the groupings is there any discussion around the groupings I 'll put the we 're not doing members number okay so it yeah but they so yanny yeah I support these go things I think they better reflect the lynnwood central reward that was the coastal who would lamort that was proposed so actually this actually I think provides a reflection of the submissions that we 've heard in terms of looking at what the community were asking through the hearings process so on I 'm happy to support what 's being proposed here I think it reflects as I said what what people requested and trying to keep for words that they liked that were working well together but also making changes based on the population growth and dealing with not one size fits all but actually or some other logical things that you would do so happy to support this one and it filled in Andrew and some similar reasons too jaani I simply support the the the way the the boards are put together and made up and like I think Linwood central including heathcott is a really good example we would seem to me that overall that is sort of like the current Hadley Eddie fear in me kind of area I think that it 's really good that this that the wards had appeared need focus on the earthquake recovery and there 's no question that is does the central city in n Pepa nui and i think this reflects the submitters strong desire to have that the be a great an increased number of community boards and the fallback position for them was that they would keep that we could keep the carronade whereas the first model the first option actually reduces the number of unity bullets so in terms of effective representation i 'm certainly supporting the amended option or is no option to be isn 't it I 'm Andrew yeah I just like to add to what 's been said which I support this in my view best represents what we heard through the submissions and subsequently through the hearings in an ideal world one would think that it would be good to have all groupings of three oral groupings of two but when you actually look at logical connections logical groupings that doesn 't work I think what we 've got here is the best reflection of what we heard through the submissions and the most logical groupings even groupings of to clean the sense in which you can have Ward 's of interest so we 've talked about communities of interest for instance if we look at lynnwood and central there was a desire expressed by submitters there that their area is kept together in looking at for instance in a city east housing which has had its own attention for some time there was a an anxiety over being put together and with the build coastal awards which will be dealing together and separately with their own issues there so to me it seems to make sense um Jamie yes I know we 're speaking specifically to how these are clustered but the reality is and I 'm voting against it one because I do disagree with clusterings but two there 's a greater issue with it because you know it is Newton 's law with every action is an equal and opposite reaction so there 's a domino effect as a result of these but trying to bring us to bay very smartly back to it to the clusterings of them are vote against it one but secondly Phil made mention of the one of they call it now the Lynwood central heathcott ward yeah and as was alluded effectively higley ferry Meade ward which it is sit though currently we have five community board members and two counselors in with us you 'll have 12 people sitting around that table so I think this is just creating many Parliament 's look at it the Lord 's 12 then there 's eight in another area then you 've got nine and banks peninsula and I just think it has a dog 's breakfast in my opinion so as a result i 'll be voting against 12 people around and the higley ferry made war would have been ok we 're doing the numbers separately so we 'll do the numbers next and i think that will change so all right so i will put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no so stuck up your hands for no so we 've got golf mangie lonsdale jones and _"

understand the costs of this do that do the community board rates of pay drop according to the number of community forth sin are so the cost of this is how much more than the current system just in terms of community board members I 'm assuming that page let me guess about 35 vs well sets duty and we go from less I 'm assuming that it continue to be the case because every second persons one you can you can for community boards you can 't further out swords but you can for community board opposite that was one less community would be for one less lot of administration costs to council as well I think that 's greater in the cost of the cell oh no I just like to know the cost of this because I think I think there 's too many communities will do this large as the current council well I think that would be plenty yeah it 's also closer to the initial proposal which is probably for it you should be closer to you yeah and people people 's submissions did focus on the numbers of community boards rather than the number of community board members so so you are you moving that the council and actually happy with option one that had given that we 've gone with option two yeah I think the community board numbers members should just go to an each line instead of three whatever whether it is staying at 11 or going to two banks peninsula that 's 8,000 has got a community board member for on this model for every thousand people sorry into a separate even the city because it I 'm happy to do this I 'm having to do maybe okay so I receptor beta okay so let 's do the peninsula separately and let 's take a mint from council about that we reduce the number of community board members ward so that 's every sub really call them subdivision of I have a seconder for that position I 'd like a second the first right turn yes thank you thank you me my ass Kurdistan is based on the current and local government Commission actor whether the are the number of a points like a committee ball you know whether the communal member has to be more than the foul pole and then the point counselor in a bowl or just equal to I just want to know so the number of appointed members has to be less than half the total numbers so if you hit 222 elected and three a pointer that would be a total of nine so your three members would be less than half of that so that will be acceptable so your point of members have to be less than half the total numbers of the community board so you mean that for later if we reduce the sewage 322 for each war then it 's communipaw is a sext come upon member plus those three the cancerous they steer the compliant with the principal is here okay yeah I thank you all right abstain weather because I don 't agree with the principal I do agree in all honesty that these numbers are is far too much representation you know in being spiritual Iran is aired rating but you know I know we were dealing with banks for lunch this secret also you don 't listen we 're only reducing the 32 the 20 just just for the urban woods just for that we have in wards oh yeah all right all right well so i will put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no um ok we 'll hit us up can you put up her Beijing things so where 's the minute that the community board members be reduced from three to two feet subdivision excluding banks potential you go from 12 okay so I disagree with the whole thing so i abstain from it well then that means that that means we 're gonna be okay so we 're voting on the amendment no I 'm with mobile but I 'm not voting against it because I don 't itch yes I know but the 's all well you can you can vote for the lesser of two evils or you can I know not though I know and it 's what grinds me with it because Lisa of two evils means that you know which flavor fish milkshake do you prefer yeah well well I will vote in this one because I 've got I 've got a this is not about the groupings this is about the cost and the numbers I know I just think it 's lost its way completely voting for or against thousand a year for community board means yes but it 's the administration it 's making the rooms bigger it 's getting new accommodation for because there are some community board rooms that will not take 12 people plus the administrative support so can I just know how many current community board members there are in total I 'm 40 pink how many current and this goes in and how much extra is it gonna cost us goes for hammers at 23 voter and now we 're having questions and debate yeah all sorts of arguments yep what the situation is but you know i mean i am going to vote on this because it 's not to do with the groupings of the wards and we are allowed to take the cost we are allowed to take the costs into account the votes just been held and we 're now having a question and answer session that 's weird it hurt Hayes but I couldn 't call the boat because it sounded like it was pretty pretty close no I haven 't got a thing it did you get a no no just wait I haven 't got it can you can you decide I 'll just so I decide No hold special night hey this is about whether we reduce the number of community board members pure subdivision p award to two so that instead of having three per ward we have to port ward yeah yeah yeah that 's right but this is whether it 's too p ward or 3p award and somebody was asking about the cost of it but we don 't have the costs in front of us because you 're not but we 're boarding orders we 've already discussed this so this is approximately the same number of community towards as we 've currently got it was too close to call though so we 're going to have a vote on it and if we end up if we end up with an even vote if we end up with a draw then that stays at three because that 's a voting system no but it is in the proposal oh I see yeah your default which default and we default to the proposal yeah this is a minute to see certain amendments of what 's been put up of the substance of motion or get many kinds of us then the substantive goes back to the substantive know it goes to it it goes to the proposal I 'm sorry it 's an amendment to the proposal and the proposed I put up my motion which I don 't know I know but we split it into two votes and it defaults to the proposal angel I 'm sorry okay that does which means that it is go salaries with Awards the next decision was yeah Mary please is Allah talk so there 's there 's two different decisions the mayor 's right there 's two different decisions you have to make here one is the boundaries of the community for words of what you have moved the next decision is the number of community board members now if you can 't reach a decision on the number of community board members you probably would have to default to what we doubt as the initial proposal which had 22 members and each subdivision on 93 there was no submissions favoring this anyway not so I don 't know that this is even marginally I achieve I actually think that perhaps technically we 've gone around the wrong way because the default position is too that 's the default position because that 's what we went out with in the proposal I think that we actually have to have a motion that moves three yeah we have to have a separate motion that moves three so evidence produced for this on what basis can somebody moves so what out of order now and say that we 're going to we 're going to delete all of that we 're going to delete the counselor bucks count scandrett amendment and what we 're going to do is we are going to have Andrew and go back up Andrew and go back Andrew and Clearwater so turner and clearwater moved and seconded that there be three community boards and the urban wards three community board members and the urban war that urban subdivisions of the wards right dude yeah that 's great yeah so so so we 're going to move we 're going to have so this is a separate motion that counselor Turner because the first one was that we moved the bat ba the sub the community board subdivisions now we are moving that the community board members be three per subdivision and that that creates something that 's now different from what we went out with what we went out with was to subdivision all right okay as a point of order understand on what basis and what evidence is this projected on but it 's 's a so we 've heard submissions but nobody has suggested this yeah but just come from their field now no no it was we did have we did have an option that had three per board well I don 't remember any submissions favoring this yeah so it we desperately want more community members the thing is is that I mean I don 't know do you want to open this up for debate now that we 've got the proper resolution on the table all right we 'll open it up for debate Phil and look at it 's not from the field it was in that it 's in the options part of option two and I think I 'm going to support three members I think that although wasn 't submitters didn 't specify they wanted an actual increase in the number of Representatives I think they certainly made it clear they wanted an increase in there and us as counsel to support and increase in the representation and that 's what three members would do and it would also allow board members to be proactive there 's there 's plenty of scope for keyboards in terms of future delegations that I expect this council will get or give them there 's plenty of scope for community boards to rebuild the city and do the things which we would like them to do so that 's why im sue be supporting the option of other number of board members subdivision or go to be and three and ten thank you i 'm obvious i won 't be supporting this because when the first when this first went out i do believe that we heard that people wanted better representation and i believe the 16 council model does us with the two-member community boards and their first and original proposal went out it was done as economically as possible i think that 's really important to remember this three proposal changes that totally so I do believe with the 16 counselor model we have listened to what the people have said and they want better representation from the counselors which they will do but with the two-member council community board members I think we still achieve that responsibly as possible thinking um I 'm just Mary 's just highlighting an issue here which I think we do need to take into account one is that the issue is hard to substantiate based on the evidence that we 've received and you know it is based on submissions that we 've received if we 're changing from what we went out with to what we 're going with then there really does have to be some something of substance to go with it and aricent in this particular occasion so we are at risk going down this tree but the second thing and I think it 's probably more important as the definition of promoting good local government under the local government act the Commission has to be satisfied when it 's doing a reorganization that it will best promote the purpose of local government and will facilitate and the affected area improved economic pork four months which may include efficiencies and cost savings and productivity improvements both within local authorities and for the businesses and households that interact with those local authorities so even though that 's actually we do need to take the finances into account and that 's why I 'm staining from the position on the boundaries because that 's based on communities of interest which I thank councillors are able to reflect on far more accurately than I can but in terms of the money I 'm afraid I have to support the alternative to the three Paul and then Andrew I heard loud and clearly from a number of submitters it came through and said they had been very well represented this to him they were very happy with the way they 've been represented so to add more community board members I think would be a mistake because we 've actually heard I 've been quite happy so and the same goes for the counselors but obviously that 's not the debate here it has about the community board member so I will be voting against adding any more community board members in this process entry yeah as the proposer of the motion and having heard what we 've just heard with the agreement of the seconder and to avoid a proposal that I moved and councillor Clearwater seconded to be amended to two board members subdivision rather than three and that actually avoids the issue and to be honest had we known the information that we now know we may well have not put their proposal in the beginning so I 'm quite happy as the mover to simply change the community board and subdivision representation from three to two to avoid any further vote um well so you would I think you 're effectively with the bank spatulas we 're dealing with separately yeah but we 're on the same page so it just withdraw the amendment if you withdraw the amendment then it 's too as the default position so that right should be possible solution that will you ok so we confirm we confirmed the original proposal that that there be two yeah confirmed the original proposal that there be to the initial proposal that there be two community board members what elected to each subdivision elected froms each subdivision and that 's move counts Latinos second accounts of Clearwater so if you take out the wording so- thing what there were a number of somebody 's that said they didn 't wish to reduce the number of community boards yeah yeah i didn 't see any that said that they wanted to decrease the number so we 've decreased the number so does that mean that we 're also got the same machine so we have most of most of the submissions where they didn 't want the number of metro community boards to create yet yeah so that 's what the submission was about and we had from feminist proposal we still have the six metro community boards so that 's exactly what the submitters ask for row that it 's about the only reason that that 's showing a reduction is because of banks peninsula was to community board areas now one so the submissions in for all those other people that we in in lies them all our report clearly sees that was a big travel to people consumed about okay that 's fine thanks i 'm adam just so just just to clarify the total number of community board members at the a total number of communities wall movers somebody must have but 14 15 banks peninsula you said the stardom emitters yeah so it 's the same yeah thanks David I just like to point out that if we are supporting this motion of to community board members subdivision we are actually reducing the representation in our community boards they 're currently it 's five members elected at-large from a community board area we are now in the wards that are proposed to be paired will have four elected members community board members and two councillors so your representation is actually dropped by 14 for those community boards and I don 't think that 's sort of quite what people in visits and i 'll be voting against the resolution okay so i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no so hands up for no golf and east now we move to banks peninsula does now I presume Andrew you want to move the current proposal the initial proposal the the eight members over for subdivisions yes okay so Andrews moved the initial proposal the initial proposal cuz the initial proposed the initial proposal was to each nobody oh it 's ugly the initial proposal to go back to option one the initial proposal you are moving the initial proposal right yep okay dessert do I have a seconder for the initial proposal Phil so there 's now one councillor and eight community board members so a community board of nine exactly the same as what 70,000 people get over the hill what 's it suggested ah but we 'll debate this sorry that 's actually that 's actually incorrect sorry I apologize because the initial proposal had to community forest yes and it 's now proposed that there be one so so you 're going to move that the initial recommend the initial proposal be amended to establish one community board with one with four subdivisions so we 've already made the decision to establish the one banks peninsula community board yes but we had to confirm it as a council so shall we do that separately and then some vendor booths and then debate the numbers the numbers the answer to the as well because it may be that if we ended up with different numbers the two plus two plus two plus two then two subdivisions may be more appropriate than four so the subdivisions and the numbers really are connected well if that 's the case then then maybe we should foreshadow another resolution which is that a corolla why why riwa be one subdivision amount here but I mean little to mount here but be another subdivision yeah so if we did the one community board and then making a second resolution with the subdivisions and the naked members that the initial proposal be amended to establish one community board all right so take out the subdivisions Oh what 's subdivisions no that 's fine yeah what 's subdivisions so I 'll end it sickened up by council clearwater i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no ok so hands up for no one two three four five six Oh hands up for i 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 so that 's no I 've already said that I 'm board boundaries so that 's seven sex so so that 's the initial propos will be amended to establish one community board with subdivisions the second question is the establishment of the subdivisions and then the number of Representatives peer subdivision so really the two choices are to establish a subdivision of a karora why I agree were in another subdivision of mount a little to mount here but or to establish four separate subdivisions so I 'd like to move four separate subdivisions with two members for me we do the numbers so if we do the fourth subdivision supra to the numbers the numbers and the subdivisions are inextricably connected because if we ended up with something different than egg members we probably would want the subdivision slip difference as well when I get into the debate I 'll explain why there 's a need for equality because it 'll come to all sorts of outcomes that are things that we wouldn 't want if we don 't do it that way and that 's the reason why in my view the subdivisions and the numbers are inextricably based on little tongue so one subdivision that elects community board member you member look we 're going to come to that in a minute but so you want to move that there be four separate sub the force subdivisions a corollary will amount to hear that little son I mean that they 're all written down there with two community board members elected from each subdivision and you 're sick and dying that fell okay so so we 'll hang on visit but is there at does anyone want to amend it yeah but do you want to amend er no no but then what happens if just I cannot for the life of me understand hair but if you sorry let me just put this bluntly if it 's not amended then it will default to the original proposal which is two from each that 's the original proposal so so actually know or we hang on no I haven 't_''_1768.72 I haven 't got the original proposal the original proposal is that there be two separate community boards which we 've already agreed not to him so we 'll have a debate about these four separate subdivisions if it 's carried no no that 's not the original oh I see yeah so yeah so the point an amendment on it or is it for sharing hey you want an amendment yes because if there 's an amendment it 's an order if the amendment is an order then it will assist us to actually debate whether this is going to be here 's a suggestion which can be an amendment so if they 're going to have four wards which I understand was yes for subdivisions we are okay so then i would suggest having one community board member from a career one from why wearer and one for man herbert and two from littleton right so the that 's that is perfectly in order as an amendment so one from a Corral one from where we were one from mount here but and two from littleton point out that the population and mount Hubert is about the same as the population and little time so if you look at the breakdown you 've got occurred I could or 1098 and where data mount too but 2610 in Littleton 2616 yeah 1122 okay so 1122 that there be one from akaroa and while we were and two from Mount here but two from littleton and do do we have a seconder for that amendment and term seconds that amendment all right now discussion Andrew can I ask a question first of all yep and it relates to the pay the Littleton man Herbert and a Corot why rural community boards currently paid which is less than the community board members in the city and the chairs are also peds I 've played significantly less than those in the city would that continue to be the case under a new model that 's all over representation on peninsula so the determination by the local authority was that and the chairperson and those community boards get 26 in the members get 17 where the chairs of the other boards get 38 and a half and the members get 25 season they may amend that with amendments to the celery or the peninsula for members so tweet cheer person duty 8500 and members 25 700 but they will almost certainly review this what 's our all one does it remember there are two cheers being paid and the to community board areas at the moment yeah 26 to yeah determination for post-election based on the current arrangements alright entry so I 'm assuming that we 're going to debate the whole thing together and they have taken two votes so the peninsula is out of kilter with the rest of the sitting in terms of representation and that 's because the peninsula is actually very different than the rest of the city and that 's something that we 've canvassed well in all the earlier parts of the debate as well now the reason I 'm putting forward for subdivisions is because there are four quite distinct geographical areas on the peninsula if we talk about distances that certainly relates to the the need for subdivisions because when it takes an hour and a half to drive from Littleton to port leaving 45 minutes from the hill top 20 Cannes Bay that talks to the the driving distances and Mount Herbert subdivision the wiry was subdivision and the a Corot a subdivision actually reflects the previous administrative arrangements in terms of the borough councils and district councils prior to the amalgamation into the banks peninsula district and prior to the amalgamation into the city so that they are logical boundaries the representation in terms of two members subdivision that would give a community board of eight plus one counselor which is a workable sighs there 's a need for equality across the subdivisions administratively in my view regardless of the record tation around numbers and for a Corolla and why rear were to be over-represented is actually aligned with the earlier decision that we made with the proposal that we went out for consultation of them which is that because of the isolation that a Corolla in particular and why ray were to an extent are subject to there is a need for greater representation in those areas there 's also in my view and need for equality across the four subdivisions because as soon as you get an inequality then that speaks to the chair always coming from the meetings always been held in one part of the peninsula potentially which in turn leads to ineffective representation for a Corolla and why ruin which was exactly the reason why we identified those communities as needing a higher level of representation in that earlier decision the other part of effective representation is actually getting good people to stand for these positions when you look at the echo a subdivision being bigger than one-third of the geographical size of the rest of the sitting so the metropolitan area it 's a certain type of person that would put their hand up to do that and there may in fact not be a person that was willing to do that on their own because it 's a huge area there 's a huge amount of driving there 's huge diversity in those communities and if we look at the amount of work in terms of each of those Bay 's having its own separate residents association each of those reserves having its own separate and reserve management committee the level of representation that the people on that part of the peninsula to go from what currently is five members representing a corollary were 22 members representing that whole area would be a significant change in representation for the people of that part of the ward also to expect one person to do the work that three community board members are currently doing in the air corot a subdivision is a big ask for that person and I believe that would have an effect on the the quality and number of people that were willing to stand to to do that so the reason that level of representation on the peninsula needs to be different in my view is that because the peninsula is very different it 's all of the same arguments that we we heard around the the need for the counselor arrangement to be different it 's about distance it 's about diversity and community it 's about the amount of work and it 's also very easy when you look at the landscape of the peninsula and the amount of roading on the peninsula so take a view that the work of a peninsular community board member isn it 's also driven by the environment when we 're talking about roading when we 're talking about parking when we talking about landscape issues and when we 're talking about reserves of which there are many and of which are a far bigger size than many of the reserves in the city so my strong view as the person around the table with the the greatest familiarity with the way that the community boards currently work successfully and with the way that the peninsula communities currently work is that we do have a need for those eight members to ensure effective representation for the peninsula and are strongly advocate that and I urge my counsel and fellow councillors around the table to vote in favor of the two plus two plus two plus two model for reasons of effective representation and equality between different parts of the ward from the administrative viewpoint very good um riff and then Yanni yeah thanks I mean I completely appreciate what andrew is saying about banks peninsula it is a special place and in a way needs i think some kind of special position with the community boards they have at the moment is effectively illuminating the problem that we have here by trying to fix something that just is not broken and we 're going round around the houses trying to fit all of this stuff into something that makes sense when actually we don 't even need to be doing it in the first place so I don 't think there is an answer here I don 't think we 're going to come up with a good answer if we wanted an extra counselor we could have probably put one in somewhere quite easily without having to chain any of these community boards and I just think we 're making a rod for our own back here and you know this discussion is a prime example of why actually we should just leave things as they are wait another three years so you have the population shifts and then have a have another look at it so in a way i 'm not particularly arguing for the amendment that i put forward other than from a people representation perspective it from a representation perspective that having nine community board members in banks peninsula is equivalent to nine in pendleton y mari soon to be known as Pendleton why Mario held which is actually the same ward so you know I don 't_''_2381.249 I mean I don 't know I mean there 's no this actually I couldn 't care having a community board members they have in banks peninsula but you know it 's it 's not an easy decision for us to make yanny thank you I think it 's really important that we have to do this by law so actually to say things like we don 't need to be doing this in the first place as an actually it 's not a choice that we have so we have to go through a representation review and part of the key element of that is listening to what people have said to us and trying to come up with a proposal that responds and then agreeing to some recommendations to go forward to the local government I heard very clearly from the peninsula that they were fundamentally I have a lot of sympathy with that you the idea that you can just go to fewer and fewer elected members and possibly have more more commissioners unelected more consultants more things being delegated away unless representation or something that actually i think is a choice that we could make but it 's not a choice that i would agree to and I think we fundamentally have to look at what the purpose of community boards are and they are to advocate for their communities and represent their communities and they 've got local decision-making so I have a strong view that it 's not just as simple as comparing the peninsula to the city when you look at the community boards and therefore I support the amendment that 's been put forward we heard a number of people talk about not wanting to have people voting in a certain area for their representatives they didn 't want to lose the local opportunity to select who represented them because they had smaller communities of interest and that came through very clear from the peninsula so for the reasons that from this reward it 's the same reason I think way you would have subdivisions at a community water level and actually what we 've done is reduce the cost of administration which probably actually saves money so i think the trade-off is by reducing the number of community boards that and we 're also proposed to reduce the number of community board members it 's just to the extent the debate we 're having as the extent to which we do that I find what threw in proposes a fair compromise recognizing the submissions that didn 't want changed but accepted that if there was change that they would have one community board for the peninsula and I think this is the fairest level of representation with those subdivisions and the numbers that have been proposed very good all right what _"

    "text": "item 23 which have all been waiting for is cheap executives report item to food and we deferred this item at the last meeting because our chief executive wasn 't here and we thought it was very mean to acting chief expect it to answer a whole lot of questions on a report if you hadn 't written so right so questions oh I just want to really congratulate air staff on the huge number of engagement processes which we 've got underway it is just tremendous and it 's an example of really good democratic process where I think as a council we engage really well and I was at a cycleways engagement meeting last night and it was really impressive number of staff for their the number of reasons were there and that was particularly relation to their walk cycle way so I just want to say to the staff at this time well well done Kelly yeah I 'd agree with it and not only are they covering a huge range of issues but they 're doing it in ways that it here so that greater number people as well x yup yeah I wanted to say something to you and but this is actually about our chief executive because as you know I get invited to a lot of events is the mirror of Christchurch and a lot of them are after hours at Friday night said day nights weekends public holidays i 'll be giving out a civic award which will be fabulous tomorrow at the A&P show but you know see so we do these things and and and we 're elected to do that Carlene Edwards has been so visible in our study and it 's fantastic you know it really is because I just noticed that you know we were at the Salvation Army dinner on Friday night and and we were there to support the organization 's response to the earthquakes you know and they were saying thank you to their volunteers and and the people who contributed so much to make their response what it was and it was just great because I just know that historically and I 'm not referring to anyone in particular but you know there and our chief executive is very visible in our community and I 'm very very grateful for that so does anyone got an ear from from Phil I mean last night I attended the cycleway drop-in session and a niche weird which was really Chalker and half a dozen staff there at least and handled the people really really well I know there was another one at spin ssible at eight o 'clock on roading so they are get out there and doing extraordinary hours and I just support what you say Phil yeah yeah me yeah thank you I just wondered um how we 're progressing the regional levy for our facilities and whether there 's any kind of work program around that whether there 's any sort of how we 're just communicating that to the external partners so we 're not progressing anything at the moment it was one in a list of things that we 're opportunities for us to consider entender increasing revenue but also increasing participation outside of Christchurch and we had certain informal discussions with you know some of our colleagues in other opposed to because they 're quite interested actually and looking at the alternative is that we might contribute to some of these as well so what we 're not it 's not the highest priority for us but it 's just something to think about in the future particularly as we 're developing new regional facilities so would we not look at the opportunity of the regeneration bill to look at some sort of funding mechanism around those anchor facilities I don 't know that the bill will do that thought it might be something that regenerate Christchurch might think about in terms of working well just like advantage it would be really good just to get an outline of a bit of a process around how we are going to have that conversation because I think it 's an important conversation to have but I think we do need to kind of think about what 's the what 's the way we do I but you know um given given what 's been expressed publicly today and obviously direction from some of our neighboring counties I guess that 's that 's all and in terms of there are a number of more urgent things for us to address we have a number of facilities and the city that really do belong to the greater Christchurch area there are facilities that we will have in the future that will really belong to the region so it 's a bigger conversation and a much more sort of a much deeper conversation it obviously has to be headed a political level but i think that the chief executives saying that the organization has just been I just basically doing some early soundings about what would be appropriate to discuss so I don 't think that it requires anything more than that at the moment it 's it 's not on the agenda as such but there are assets so for example our museum is regionally funded it is not owned by anyone of our councils it belongs to it 's owned by trust and it is funded through statute statute the idea of a statute for regional facilities you know there have been regional facilities and other areas motet and Auckland I wasn 't the art gallery considered for a regional structure when it was built I don 't know I don 't know the answer to that question so we 've gone ahead and built things and determine things I don 't even think he was me maybe it was when it was started maybe you could share with us why didn 't you know but if you see what I mean like we 're that 's not just about new SS and it 's not just about the region it 's also about the greater Christchurch area because our city is why Mac city is sell one city and I mean the I wasn 't here for the UDS debate but when I gave my speech at the Salvation Army on friday night i said you know that in christchurch that you know in the legislation we will talk about the greater christchurch area and I said what makes Christchurch greater why my career and so on and it 's true you know and but we are setting is wimax Utley is so on city you know but how far all the way for everything so there are some things that they provide within their own area that they don 't provide elsewhere so I think it 's a bigger conversation over a much longer period of time and I 'm really glad that the organization has got it on their radar because it is an issue right so I was just trying to understand the next stage of that no not right now no no nothing in our green just a question on page or in relation to page 137 colleen d capital and earthquake rebuild expenditure being behind there some big sums in there what are the primary reasons for this well there are a range of reasons but if you look at the split between what we 're directly responsible for and what other agencies were involved with then in fact our agents the work that we do is actually has quite low carryforwards so still more than land drainage rebuilders about 2.5% carry forward major facilities around six point four percent an approach it 's about nineteen percent transport around fifty-seven percent burn when you break which of course has been you know as now started but of course had some delays around that some of the areas around bridge renewals community centers some of it 's actually about timing or payments so you know we still hold over our payment for the bus exchange but haven 't paid that or haven 't_''_539.2 been invoiced for that here the same with a frame plate playground so some of it 's actually about not work stopping but actually the way that we budget and carry fraud in terms of our payments so some works our timing saying some of its a lot around those large projects as well that have been delayed for reasons that you know thank you can I just follow up with one me if I look at say skirt the budget is 132 the actual today is 90 so given that skirts going to kind of fold back into us at the end of next year are there 's some financial risks more than what we need to so so you robbed at me as you know that the issues around skirt around for school to start projects which actually will need to be able to start and end and the time that they have available so we 're we 're working is about what projects we might be able to give to scoop to maintain that capacity that they have whilst we work out the other issues with central government around Akashi agreement there are Russell and the sense that it 's about the capacity to actually do the work ultimately and which is why we want to maintain it as much as possible okay right any others Jimmy on page 140 community engagement the issue main south or common-law intersection safety improvement the consultation has been done on 60 in September so how is the update status process and timeframe on this issue but yes the update status oh I 'll have to get back to you on that thank you any other questions with someone like to move that the council received a report term seeking to fill I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye as opposed say no that 's carried I think _"

    "text": "I don 't think there 'll be any disagreement who would like to move the staff recommendation would anyone like to move the staff recommendation Pauline so are there any questions it 's really just a clarification and i know that in this was done quite quickly and thank you very much because i think there 's a very strong submission it 's just that in our page seven the third bottom paragraph lists the partners in the UDS and we need to also just include the DHB and sarah net realest that 's all so there 's just a minor omission in thank you I think unfortunately they might have been messed up the food submissions as well because I just took that from becky i think the submission is quite clear and actually in some places it goes wee bit stronger than even i would have gone excuse excuse me you told me to be brutal you weren 't supposed to say that publicly that 'll be the heat well they did very well you did very well I don 't think anybody 's neptune any doubt on a couple of little minor changes and i 'll just do them later with colleen or orally in and that I the idea that you put forward of the elected members then being able to select somebody else I don 't think I don 't think we shouldn 't anyway allow for compromises on democracy I think maybe should always elect that completely and the other option now guess that we could have looked at is that we just take transport and ear and leave this authority with only water but perhaps you didn 't want to go what he said they 're only so many times you can actually say that and there is a review he 's so no way I 'd I didn 't see the point in no that 's actually a very good point it was actually the position that we adopted and when the government does review our presence was for I wonder whether will be useful for the Select Committee that we attached the that concept the the actual proposal that we put to the government when they were when they called for this has taken from that document yeah but I can 't attach it and as well I think the point that you make about the changes coming quite soon and Paula Bennett was that the the MIT Ramires meeting that you sent me to on Tuesday and obviously changes are about to come about that will allow for the transfer of functions between regional councils and councils obviously I took the chance to mention public transport too early and she was aware of it and remained so and so I mean it is a logical and sensible thing that the council would take public transport and if we don 't get it in this round then there is a second round coming up quite soon but I think and I just like to congratulate you on your brutality thank Andrew then Yanni yeah I think this is entirely appropriate and I 'd like to echo the comments that Vicki 's closing comments I really want to acknowledge both the clarity and strength in this submission is taken a position that I totally support and I 'm happy to have this support thank Annie yeah thank you I 'm just one thing that was asked her at the submission spinner which i haven 't seen included was the fact that the government actually changed the local governor so they can actually appoint commissioners and have people statutory managers come into councils now if they 've got concerns and I think that 's a pretty compelling reason why they don 't actually need to make unelected appointments because they 've actually got that power everything 's aren 't going and the test is very low for them to intervene I mean they 've become pretty much beyond the whim of a minister and they can come and put the appropriate people and to deal with whatever concerns they may have so you know yeah I think I 'm the other thing is that it was kind of asked and I agree that i support your beauty um you 're strong stance in terms of an elite at again but also that sometimes pictures tell a thousand words so pictures of things like the air quality in ballston or pictures of the cows the illegal waste dumps or pictures of the quarries and the southwest actually find a pretty powerful picture of concerns that people have expressed who have no democratically elected representatives to advocate on the other half so I was just wondering if they could be fit thank you sir so you 're suggesting we add pictures to those my book we 're actually regarding the water authority is something that should be mr. bush if you if you read some of those the 2013 royston report I think it was you know I just fit I just caution about that but I your first point I totally agree with I think that it 's important that we reflect the changes in the legislation so that the the government has powers that it didn 't previously have and that would enable the government to a point to elected boards if they were concerned about you know various matters they don 't have the power to do that for the purposes of continuity which is the that the power that they 're proposing I have a very simple view on this and it 's an absolute and if the government wants to appoint members to run an organization then they should take the power of taxation off them it 's as simple as that so I have a very strong bill on this and I 'm very pleased with it but I think you should pick up the point that that Jonnie makes but I don 't think that we 're going to get anywhere on the we 're not going to get anywhere on promoting our cause if we look to attribute any blame to existing organizations for any functions that they may or may not carry out because I 'm sure that there would be those that would make similar comments about our organization from time to time and it 's easy to say things without causality having necessarily been established so I 'm going to caution against the photograph approach I totally agree about the changes in the legislation but I just think that it would be really dangerous to go down that pathway because people who live in glass houses you know have to be particularly careful about things but if one of their first paragraphs and submission acknowledges that we 're actually talking about the processes my sentiments exactly that 's right to support the N is on page seven that we 're talking about the creature report notes the explicit intent is for the commissioners to withdraw and be replaced by elected representatives as soon as their task is achieved and the next paragraph we say it is clear these objectives have been met however the government has so if we go saying that they haven 't achieved them but also have a question if I may in it 's just a very very last paragraph saying that the government either willingly or by default may be responsible for the fact that achieving the objective of fraternity and democracy and the time now available is at risk so how much time do we have is it still possible for them to to make a decision to return to yep because the representation review has to conclude at a time where they announce an April this legislation could follow a similar trip to the timetable set for the greater Christchurch Trent regeneration bill I would think that would be a big ass to stop what they 're doing now and then start again with a different focus and objective and also get it all done before the 2016 elections that 's just my feeling on but then legally they could change the legislative framework by April next year and it was still there in time yeah yeah we could do that yeah do the econ elections have to take place at the same time as the risk the local government nephews you couldn 't offset them we don 't have that now alright so I will so now we have to decide whether we wish to appear at the oral hearings of the Select Committee and if so nominate that council or who will speak to the submission on behalf of the council I 'm happy to would you like the deputy mere to accompany me I think I 'd have to feel sorry for the Select Committee and we 'd like you dear as well were you you 're not off the hook at all yeah we don 't have to travel to Wellington it 's a additional additional advantage well I did actually suggest it offering this room for the hearings was going to be interesting if we made a submission so the mere and the deputy mayor will be sitting down there and the chair of the Select Committee will be sitting up here oh yeah now you 'll be sitting next to us oh really yes okay we shall be calling upon you for your guidance and advice thank you all right I shall put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you very _"

    "text": "34 establishment of strategic Oversight Committee okay I 'll move that seconded by fell is there any discussion Glenn yani fall thank you me I will support it but just a wee note of other councillors could have a go at some of these things sometime would be really appreciative so not questioning the ability of those on it but I think some of us are getting a bit missed out so it would be good if we now and again we could just be included in some of these these pretty critical committees would be good I normally speak at the end but I 'm gonna speak now because I don 't want people to think that this is anything other than what it does it 's a chair of cheers it 's that I 'm the it 's the cheers meeting it 's the meeting of the chairs of the committee 's so that it is made up of the cheers of cheered as a finance and strategy and riggs and concedes it has the mere and the deputy mayor i chair deep amir deeply cheers and and on the strategy and Finance Committee that 's a terrible way of putting it so counselor mangie takes over as the chair and I take over as the deputy chair so it 's a it is a strategic Oversight Committee it 's called a strategic oversight subcommittee because it is made up of all of the chairs of all of the committee 's that means that we 've got oversight of all of the agendas of all of the meetings that are going on through those so it is certainly not a reflection on any other councils all councillors work very hard this is a group that I wanted to have formalized as a council committee I 'd hope to do that through the finance and strategy committee that was not a position that I was able to pursue at the time I think we have agreement now that this provides a link point with governance and management so that we will be able to meet on a formal regular basis with the council executive team chief executive and myself and I think that that 's a very good structure think it will improve the functioning of the council only got 12 months to go so we can make it make it work so thank you yani yeah I just had a question as to how this committee will be informed of the wider council laws concerns and issues and how it will report back to the wider membership of the council and whether or not any councillor could attend if they wish to Paul yeah what can sorry that 's a question but we 're debating the motion about nobody yeah okay oh sorry wolves speak to I thought that 's what you were doing sorry I thought there were rhetorical questions because they 're all answered in the paper well they 're not it 's um sorry I 'm not being facetious I honestly thought that was the point that you were wanting to make this is that we 're appointing a subcommittee of the council it has no decision-making delegations none none not one decision-making delegation are we giving it it is simply an oversight committee it reports back through the normal friendly channels of communication that against it then um I actually think this is really significant and I don 't support having a smaller committee that goes away and provides advice governance and strategic direction without a clear framework for how it reports back and if you take some of the examples of the like meeting with certain people the factors that we have no process by which those who aren 't and the small group can raise things to get addressed so we get huge frustration that things that should be relatively straightforward and simple and not being dealt with and have no clear process to be dealt with and only those people in the know get invited to attend and can provide that level of advice that it has been sought so I actually think that this is divisive not inclusive and that saddens me because I think the strength of a collective Council as a council that works together so I don 't think now 's the time to be making these sorts of changes I don 't like having something like this setup without any clear reference to how it reports it oh good oh well why not sure I had some questions because to me it looks like we 're delegating authority to the subcommittee to develop the annual plant systems reference no leading leaving development of annual and long-term plans and budgets it should say leading leading the development doesn 't vote estate leading this is that development both Daniel a long-term plans in terms of reference the elective lives it authorities let 's go let 's des putting my key part is that we 're a team okay to get elected and if we 're not involved to a cut oh you 're tired I 've got a finger in your friends yeah it 's not it I 'm the one who 's legally required to lead the development of annual and long-term plans and budgets that 's my role under the Act the strategic oversight group is to provide some a steer no decisions are being made by this groove I mean I thought we 'd had this discussion look I only found out about the strategic oversized kind of about a week and a half ago terms of reference the development of annual and long-term plans and budgets he 's but it 's providing governance advice and strategic direction to the council as an organization with respect to the following direction advice on not just go to terms of reference the very last bullet is the development of long yes I know but it 's it 's based on what appears before it it says providing governance of governance advice and strategic direction to the council was an organization so this is a governance group and it provides governance advice and strategic direction to the council as an organization with respect to the following and it should just take out the rest because it 's a repeat of words well I 'd be happy if you change in the terms of reference that it would be rather than the development of angular long-term plans and budgets the leading of the development of long-term plans and annual budgets will be a boy proof it 's providing governance advice and strategic direction reread the top bird and then it 's prompt with respect to elected representatives priorities legal church governance direction and oversight of organizational transformation projects including great for Christchurch and the development of annual and long-term plans and budgets so the idea is is that this group provides some strategic direction to the organization it can 't make decisions and one of the things that would be a clear example is that this group would say to the chief executive unto the executive leadership team this needs to go up to council now you can 't proceed down this track until you 've got counsel sign off it 's actually alerting the organization at what point things have to come back to Council for decisions it is not taking away the responsibility of council as an organized as a an elected membership group to make the decisions this group cannot make decisions it is simply providing some strategic direction and we engage with each other in order to get a steer we 're talking about the chairs of the committee 's every single one of your zone committees I mean it 's that 's what it 's all about but um I don 't_''_526.73 I just we don 't have any any committees what checks you include all councillors this is about estimate as to make the strategic part of every workable and and I take from the terms of reference that is about at an ability to for this subcommittee to coordinate those strategies and I will I will as a proposed member of it I would welcome ideas from all councillors and I 'm sure the committee word as to what we all consider our priorities around our strategic direction as a council I 've actually been looking forward to something like this subcommittee to pull out stretch strategic direction together for some time and I 'm actually very pleased to see it now it 's very it 's important though that the advantage of the subcommittee is it will have minutes and that will report to Council so there 's every reason for all councillors to be really involved with it and I reiterate I invite suggestions about what we all consider as priorities in terms of the direction council but know who is affected if we 've been given the opportunity whatever this was debate yeah it is so so we 've got no opportunity to make 2hd asked questions we had to go straight and debate if we adopt una to actually ask some questions some of the stuff would 've been cleared up sorry I 'd give a more special I thought that you I thought that you know the two groupings had had a good discussion about us I apologize I thought that you hate so I don 't know what yeah no no no and I 'm just trying to work out a yeah I think we are too but you know that is I mean I know that that some counselors have always have a problem with delegated decision-making so when we set up the insurance subcommittee there 's you know that that was opposed by very few that but but everyone else was willing to hand over the decision making this isn 't a decision making body this is actually just to provide a strategic steer to the organization that 's a question if I 'd been able to ask the question without heaven go straight about it would have got a better understanding I thought that people had had a discussion Paul I 'm sorry I must apologize to you so what would you like to know if this is not a decision making body that 's not taking away our opportunity to be part of the development of the annual plan and long-term plans because to me that 's the fundamental pass for me too I 'm happy yeah but it 's just the fact that we didn 't get an opportunity to actually I thought that you had I really did I do apologize I thought that the two groups had had a discussion Andrew thank you so the point i think has been well made that this subcommittee is not going to have any delegated decision-making power whatsoever and obviously the big decisions that council needs to make around these big strategic issues and the big matters like the long-term plan the annual plan any other strategic decision still rest with counsel for me this is absolutely essential it 's what 's been missing for a long time and it 's what council a lot more smoothly and without the need for papers to be sent back because the papers didn 't ultimately reflect the view of councillors and weren 't capable have been debated and so on i 'd also make the point that with membership of this committee comes responsibility so any member of this committee has a responsibility to communicate with the other councillors who are not members of this committee and also has a responsibility responsibility to behave on the subcommittee in a way that reflects the view of the whole council there is no point in this subcommittee debating things in a way that brings recommendations or results that are not aligned with the ultimate view around the council table so I believe that all of us that are on this subcommittee need to have a reasonable overview of what the view of council is likely to be so that we 're bringing recommendations or bringing work from the subcommittee which is likely to be supported by council otherwise we we lose the value of having the subcommittee but the key points here are that this subcommittee to happen for some time to happen in a situation which has got both formality so minutes can be taken and status so there 's a way of reporting to council so I strongly support this I think this is actually the keys are getting the most out of the rest of this council term and I strongly urge other members to do the same thank you i 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye aye those opposed say no it 's Anna you 're handsome opposed okay so now we 're back to the or have we done 30 said under the council submission on the Environment Canterbury bill _"

    "text": "a different set of recommendations that I have proposed and I 'm going to move these so that we receive the report on the crash each visit a strategy agree in principle with the concept of a converged model to deliver the council 's and other stakeholders strategic objectives outlined in the paper note that the council officials are currently engaged in a program of targeted stakeholder engagement around great for Christchurch request that the convergence model options pay for do for consideration by council identifying LTP changes including levels of service if any that will need to be addressing the annual plan as well as following specific issues and they are the integration of the cruise terminal proposal into the strategy and consideration of cathedral square and then noting that the need for the visitors strategy to be underpinned by more holistic visitor proposition founded on the city 's unique physical cultural and creative assets alongside the built environment and request that a discussion paper be prepared by staff drawing out these themes for our informal workshop as the 20th for Monday it 's really hard to really text 's a lot of words and details like that 's okay so um she 's like environment we have built and natural diamond yeah ya know you 've got physically but it 's a different the built and natural moment you know that is absolutely true what about the outstanding mentioned season unique and outstanding yeah no no we 've already got unique so you can no no I think that the points made and and I think that was intended to be picked up around physical assets but the natural environment is very good all right 20th yeah ember is it friday the 20th is it the proper date friday the twentieth of november okay all right any discussion yani um we 've only got half the recommendations in front of us that we 're voting on so it 's really hard to actually make ok it 's good somebody so or email them that 's it would that solve the problem more yeah so um can you just scroll back up a little bit please so that we can see the first few right ok so um I that would come as part of an LTP whether that would go out for consultation on any of those changes that were proposed or whether it was simply just be made it 's not clear from that revolution I 'm sorry I 'm number four no yeah so that we 've got a convenient convergence model options paper due for consideration by counts on the twenty-fourth of februari and what we 're asking that paper to do is to identify any LTP changes including levels of service that will need to be addressed an annual plan because obviously with the annual plan coming up if we 've got any changes to the LTP you know through levels of service or the different configurations that might require consultation beyond the stakeholder engagement that will that has been a you know engaged at this stage and will be further engaged in the future if there 's anything further that needs to go out for a broader consultation then that will be addressed in the annual plan so there 's no no danger of people missing out on the opportunity to have a a say on a particular matter inform the draft LTP changes or sorry the draft in your plan changes to the LTP know that the options paper which will look at the options for convergence between our different delivery arm some of which we own some of which we don 't own and that that broader perspective that 's included in the and the paper that we 're receiving what we 're doing is we are asking are there any LTP changes that are required as a result of their of the decision that we made so that we can consult on them during the annual plan tonight um it 's not clear yeah maybe helpful just in fact you actually need the reference to LTP it just could really read identify any changes including levels of service that will need to be addressed in the annual plan yeah I that 's effectively watch where you will do this in there okay if you want to address them in your plan for public consultation need session from the draft and your plan what what I 'm concerned about is and 're considering the adoption of the draft annual plan but if that 's before the 25th or februari then obviously that 's not going to work so I just want to be really explicit that will get all the information we need before we adopt the draft annual plan so that we can if we want to consult say actually this is what we want to consult on in terms of level of service activity management plans what we need any sleepy or whatever it is that we agree to sorry you 've now completely lost me I think I think the confusion is is that I 've said will need to be addressed in the annual plan so what shall up should i put need to be addressed and the annual in the 2016 to 17 annual plan process yeah no it 's the annual plan process the process of the annual plan will be where we consult on any changes to levels of cetera there 's three different processes that happen one is that people we adopt a draft that goes on for consultation the other thing is makers submission to changes to the draft annual plan that 's not publicly consulted on that gives an update in terms of where the organization 's at now personally I would feel very uncomfortable if that was the process used for these changes it 's not designed for that I don 't know why you want to make this harder than it has to be but let 's see if we can get some wording that satisfies the point that you 're making which you 're reading something under here that doesn 't meant to be here so identify any changes that will need to be addressed and the draft and your plan okay these great that 's what else no no don 't don 't check the Edwards in there they 're already there just just change the word 2006-16 and put draft and your plan grow thank you and then take out process that 's right okay the other question I had was we raised a number of questions which I presumed our will be tied into that information that report coming back so we won 't get later the one I think the ones that you 've won by four o 'clock that you referred to ones that counselor Turner asked for I mean those those are matters that largely get captured in that resolution because they relate to levels of service okay so the other thing that was up and I can go through the last was the views of cct CDC and our event stuff the what was the views of their of this visitor strategy I think the advice you 've on the day that their their views had been taken into account in the in the drop as a strategy that 's fine but that doesn 't actually tell me what they 've used up no that 's that 's not what I 'm very confused because I haven 't seen you a list of questions and I now realise probably why it might be a good idea if we think about this as something that we can address at the workshop on the twentieth of November is that right yeah I stakeholders workshop with officers which I 'm going to attend from report back alongside officers to counsel on the outcomes of that meeting yeah if there are any issues that are raised by CDC cct any stakeholders they will be able to be addressed at that meeting and the subsequent meeting of councils in for me to the council and the options that come back in the options paper will give us the opportunity to take the views of those stakeholders into account I think we need to be very aware that we 're we 're in a process at the moment we 're in a certain point in that process and we haven 't reached the point in that process where the views of those organizations in the context of a we 've got til haven 't been captured in any formal senses yet and we 're setting the direction what we 're talking about now is stakeholders who will have a view the direction that we 've said yes there 's a point in that process will take that into account and that 's in the context of the options that are put to us which in turn will stakeholders and I 'm assuming that might just agree with me or certainly keen to hear as you if he doesn 't say so on page 20 page 221 what when do we get the opportunity to discuss what would strategic focus of this visitor strategy should be make amendments to the extra ticket when do we get to do that I think you asked for more material yeah I 'm back so I think that this basic I mean you you 're only receiving the visitor strategy at the moment you basically into you 've moved on to the other half of the process which counsel Turner 's been talking about which is that discussion around models of how it might work but when we come back to five you 've asked for more or pizza four and five asked for more information to underpin the business reg which I think will will need to come back to you for a full debate and adoption and that will need to happen ahead of the hitter februari okay so we can make changes to the visitor strategy after we 've your consideration yawning make the changes times you know that no no just preceding today so I would I speak to do now is to sit down the CDC again because they obviously prepared us and to say right how do we address particularly for 40 for a and B 5 and and five and then basically bring that back as a comprehensive package for council to debate and fully adopt okay it seems that we 've got the date wrong so this is not the stakeholder workshop that is being referred to but that is the stakeholders date so as a separate governance staff and formal workshop and we think it might be monday the 23rd of november what we 're just going to double check the date and once we 've got the datum dear all of those issues can be canvassed at that meeting Yanni and it will inform the next stage of the process you can I just don 't make a comment of thrown a curveball tin I 'm just sitting here as part of the process runner for the annual plan and looking at report as yannis pointed out not knowing the content of that report it 's hard to know the consultation process you need to go through to get there ideally if you can fit it within the annual plan process and it works perfectly I am concerned with that time and I think Yanni is as well that it 's so close to when you need to go out with the consultation document or the consultation on annual plan that they won 't nest necessarily closely together and there 's a gray the point of us putting this and here is that the twenty-fifth of februari paper will have had to have considered that with all of the options that are going ahead of us you see all of the what it will do is that will identify and the paper what those what options have to be included in that annual plan and you know and and and we 'll have a placeholder and the annual plan for their we won 't be going out for consultation before the twenty-fifth of februari and we we may well be approving the look for consultation I thought it 'd be close to that date but I didn 't think it would be that 's close enough to be scary so I just wanted to think about the consultation requirements which is really what i think the heart of us is getting appropriate consultation on any changes that are proposed well the advice that we 've had thus far as is that the consultation that we 've done at the moment on the on the tourism strategy is with the right people and it 's with the stakeholders it 's the stakeholder consultation what yarn is raising is whether there are levels of service affected and that then brings it into the annual plan process so I mean they 're two different things ones ones not for the visitors strategy per se at the other is for any any flow on effects two levels of service but but if you think that it 's too close for comfort then we 're gonna have to bring the 24th of every date forward making me comfortable I agree about your son Ian the consultation on no problem near but this is something different if not just come under this now if there are changes to levels of service yes we need to consult on them and yes we need to have plenty of time to ensure that they go into the dr daniel plan goes out of the consultation yes now i agree so do you think the 27th February 's going to be too late for their and if that 's the case are we going to bring that day for is cutting a very very fine showing up can we make it the 31st of january so that way that way it has to be able there 's a family introducing the report as well hey there 's difficulty in producing the report as well on making sure that it 's a fully considered report so we just do have a convergence of deadlines that we 're just going to have to manage if it becomes unmanageable we 'll just come back and say because of this we need to change and and we 'll work that through if it happens here but _''_900.23 leave for another 12 months or having to go out for a secret knock siltation please you 'd want to wait for 12 months no but and we don 't want to go out for a separate consultation present and that as well that 's helpful all day so that we have a workshop before dates on technical things line up doesn 't have to be on that particular day but it it is on that date as they we 're right it is monday the 20 30 million boy yep yeah it 's the 24th favorite date as the question so just to see that bye-bye yeah okay yeah so God is chlorophyll it 23rd like Weaver is following both the eight at the meetings on the 18 and the 20th with regards to the stakeholders there 's a stakeholder one on the 20th is it and there 's another one that 's something else in the 18th right I don 't know I wasn 't there I said this to stakeholder ones are there no they were to meeting yes slightly different I think that 18 twas a had to cheney 20s one only indra was going to go to I 'm sure that was 21 feet of chain I 'm somebody not much of this thing girl yeah okay so can I just put take out the date so it proposed government staff and formal workshop so that we can deal with us that 's cool thank you right so we 've changed that to the by the 24th of februari and we 've got going into the draft and your plan and we 've got the governor 's staff and formal workshop we are all of the questions that have been answered that can be answered bearing in mind their organizations have positions that they put to the council rather than individual staff members I think that 's really important to protect people from individual individualizing issues of such magnitude all right so are there any there any other questions question yep thank you the regarding to a seven-point assailant if we review page 213 I 'm not sure how to distinguish we got into a commentary you know they have a steering group and also providing steering group the kind of the government 's oversight so how 's the difference between this one did I just want to it was just a it was the the idea that I mean we haven 't dealt with the paper yet on strategic oversight committee but in terms of developing the detailed business case that was thought to be it 's not excluding the other group the other working group but it 's it 's actually adding a layer of oversight to out coast of epic savages or all of the committee by UV review the page 213 you know for point of 20 look studies may be confused over lake I just don 't know it doesn 't it doesn 't stop the that the council group that 's been set up to deal up with an tourism matters at all doesn 't stop that at all that still continues this is an addition it was just noting that it would be useful to have that in a way can you in fact can you write the word additional so providing additional governance oversight on the detailed obviously going to be called critical to this we have got to get the city back on its feet and the visitors strategy is a hugely important component of making that happen and I think that you know people have to remember that if we were able to gain the increase visitor numbers that we think that we can achieve through the visitor strategy then and and and if you think of the airport as having fixed costs to run every additional visitor that we can bring in through the airport means an increase in the dividend they pay our city that affects rates it brings our rates obligations down so just remember that here is a hue each financial stake on the decisions that we take in these areas they are hugely important to our city and visitors are not just tourists that international education students they are people who have come who come here for business they 're people who come here for conferences there people who come here for concerts from out of town it doesn 't matter whether they come from overseas they can come internal enjoy a vibrant life here while they 're here the more often they 'll come back and the better the word that they 'll spread so it has a multiplier effect this is very very important for the city so I just remind people that there is a financial benefit to the city when we get our Airport paying increased dividends and we are able to use that to reduce our rates obligations right ya know the stat this the staff council workshop is on the twenty-third of no bean but as we see but that 's fine we can leave it as Jonnie yeah I just want to speak to this um I think it 's really important to note that we 're just receiving this visitor strategy and then it 's a lot more work that needs to be done around a particular if you look at page 221 and the strategic focus to 2018 there 's a set of strategic focuses for example strongly advocating for rapid development of convention center avon river precinct and stadium and the schedule delivery other anchor projects and obviously that 's feedback through our annual plan and long-term plan processes that actually some of the priorities are around fixing our broken infrastructure and fixing our broken suburbs I appreciate that some people will have a view that these big projects will will generate a lot more visitors my personal view is that actually a place that 's great for locals there 's a place that 's great for visitors and so when you get your city fixed and when you get your environment enhanced to provide a good level of immunity for your citizens you actually it become an attractive place for visitors and I think hopefully through those resolutions that have been added to the original recommendations they will start to address some of those really amazing things that we have to offer as a city for everyone and that is around our unique physical cultural in a natural environment and it 's also around the unique creative industries and assets that have been developed through the transitional post-earthquake face so I 'm excited about that because I think it is a really important opportunity and it really needs to to our city but actually as a city as a whole what other things we 're doing to make this a really great place to be whether you 're a visitor or a local so I welcome the opportunity to have further conversations with our community about significant structural changes to the organization 's i think it is timely to look at that in terms of how can you get greatest energy around the different things that we 're doing and that certainly wasn 't a new concept that was something that was raised even prior to the earthquake so it 's timely that that it has done the final point I 'd make is that our population is changing and when I look at the stakeholders that have already been consulted to meet us some real gaps so I hope that there 's a proper tunity through this process to look at talking to some of the newer stakeholders that we have emerging in this area and if you take for example on page 214 just like no reference to the emerging Asian markets it does seem a bit a group that you would actually want to try and start looking at in terms of stakeholder involvement given the significance of those markets to how visit our visitors and also to our local resident population and just the very very fun of filmmakers around you know I think the other thing in terms of strategic focus that we also need to just recognize that things have changed in the relative short term so the government 's now introduced a visitor levy and one of the things we need to be strongly advocating for i would suggest as actually access to some that Lily to do the things in the strategy whether it 's providing cruise ship terminals where there perhaps it 's providing the biggest stadiums or the rapid development of some of those visitor attractions then actually I think it would only be fair that the government do consider contributing some of that Livi that they 've introduced on visitors towards some of these projects and hopefully we can we can have that conversation thank you umm_:_1485.34 Ali Andrew Jamie thank you have I 'm very pleased to with regards to this resolution but also the fact that we have included what what I saw was a huge gap which was and many of us did with the cruise terminal proposal reference which is now in there and I think that is exceptionally important and I 'm very pleased to see that in there I just would like to respond to one comment that councillor Henson has made I take issue with his comment around the stadium and convention center of course we have priorities in our communities and of course people told us through the long term plan and we hear this all the time that there are priorities and getting our roads fix that there are priorities and getting a community facility sorted but we also need a stadium and a convention center it 's who pays for that and what those relationships are we 're a city that needs to move forward there is huge economic benefit in those facilities and we can 't just dismiss them and incorrectly I have to say say it 's either our roads or those that is not and how they are paid for I do want to pay credit or give credit to our stakeholders who have done a phenomenal job in an extremely difficult environment over the last four years both with CDC and cct and our events people here at the council so they have done an amazingly difficult job and I think that this strategy will pull together a lot of the bits and pieces where there are replication and give them an even better platform if you like to work from and to work with them so I will be supporting this this afternoon Andrew support the resolution which is in front of us today I 'll keep my comments at the highest ratiya clever because I think that reflects the point in the process that we 're at at the moment there will be plenty of time to discuss the the level of detail that I know people who want to discussing as we move through further processes which are described in the in the report the the resolution we 've got in front of us I think is particularly effective in as informally in the last couple of days and it should give counsel as a level of confidence that there will be an opportunity to address those issues in detail at that time I 'd also reiterate the point that matters regarding budgets and level of service are per se annual plan matters and we 've had a talk about the timings which is good but again we we need to be very aware that their decisions which annual plan decisions which are informed by that next piece of work so it 's about getting the process is right and getting everything lined up but the key here is that economic development needs to be joined up with tourism education other aspects of the visitor economy so that we are taking a positive lead in that space through whatever form we decide is the right one that comes out of this process so that we 've got those efficiencies and we 're operating as effectively as we possibly can for the good of the city and quite possibly for the region my view on this has always been that form follows any assumptions about what the outcomes of this piece of work might be until we 've done the piece of work and considered that options report and made decisions around it so form follows function budget I think it 's fair to say also follows function if there are changes to those budgets then their annual plan decisions as i mentioned i encourage councillors to support the resolution that 's in front of us today because in order to get any outcomes from this we need to proceed to that options report and to that more detailed conversation that 's the reason that we need to vote in favor of this today Jamie yeah just like to say to this one of the most important aspects with the visitor strategy is it cannot come soon enough this is an absolutely critical piece of work and one of the most important aspects of that is that it 's the way that we are taking christchurch externally it 's seeking us on the same page it 's talking with the same saying singing from the same song sheet I suppose some people to necessarily agree what agree with me or you or anyone else single-family but it 's it but that 's not necessary about agreement it 's more about just ensuring that we 're that we 're not sending out mixed messages that we have a clear vision for Christ which we are witch we are all pulling in the same direction and so often there are a number of well-meaning organizations institutions people all with Christchurch very much front and center of their aspirations but not being on the same page and not being able to work together and not being antic being able to articulate that in a conservative manner actually ends up projecting quite a confusing message and it actually isn 't helpful for Christchurch even though their intentions are good ones I did hear a comment saying that you know being fit for residence means that we 're being that where we fit for tourists on and that 's true to a certain at steam but also equally true is as the the flip side there which is a city that has fit for tourists as a ever you can look at generations gone by and it was a lot harder to to set up a life and set up a future in a city today it 's never been easier people will be where they want to be and you know what people want to be in a place that 's pretty cool and quite fun and if you 're not quite cool when you 're not quite fun then people aren 't going to be here so maybe a generation ago or two generations ago there are a lot more factors which would mean that there would be a lot harder now not so much so I welcome this piece of work I think it 's extremely critical and I don 't think we can do it quickly enough Jimmy thank you in principle I support at least the recommendation because our environment has been total changing it is a great opportunity in founder of us if we reveal the newspaper or see the new media china airlines will have a tiebreaker flag in made a december this year and also that already china airlines chi Chi 's free flight per week also from the scenic have a three flight from the tulip I church and chana thousand airlines will direct flight from Guangzhou to chi Chi in middle of the December and also the year where the singapore airlines are quite a few airlines increase the l6 and also the height of fueling or the like I chips we sign the international relations cooperation women without lots of the country and the cities but how to meet an instant needs so we have to the you know the prepared where for the future but if we review all those kind of the visitors actually you know it 's consists of wide ranges of the visitors the first one is a traditional tourism the visitors for nationwide especially from the International second wise maybe the business you know ever conference today in this area so the event is most important and also major festival in otherwise a cherry pie GOG is the gateway of the Antarctica also you know we will review the list and hard Robin there 's a huge a coupon economic benefit international patients is the city from the oh hi my understanding within this year we probably signed a international education collaboration not only the city council cpit kendra union inca unions is partly more than 12 the education of operation this the opportunity in front of us but how to integrate it together so establish this kind of the visited a strategy this HR is a strategical the document gives a timeline for our future and also it will review the information since the 2011 up to now H you have a 15,000 migrant workers in a church as well as in cantabile magnet maybe we 'll be more you know those those also is a contributor to look I judge to the chi Chi so this way we waive the crucial but my understanding in this the stage maybe we take the kind of the Oakland you know 18 a model of the rivers but my person will ship in a more than more than later because the 18 Amato only car cover is a event and also the tourism you know and try to promote acremonium development but and also the Antarctica and the all solar migrant workers this kind of holder packages all is the opportunity for us so to to adopt at least a kind of business strategy based most crucially so I support this one I also also urge my fellow councillor support and oh my god cool thank you like ice wanna say thanks for people who 've actually put you know work with us so far to me it 's an opportunity to articulate our brand you know post the earthquake we saw some major shifts and who we are as people and what the perception of who we are as people from outside Krause tuition is a great opportunity to capture that and show their Esther New Zealand then the rest of the world exactly who we are where we want to go it also will help us identify our place in New Zealand and I think that 's really really important as a region that we have a clear strategy to serve you know solidify our place in New Zealand there 's a great place for the International Airport we 'll sure that as a gateway to the south island that we actually have our place and we stamp our mark we sing currently Auckland flying tourists straight over a head to queens down and there has a net loss to the south of the half a billion dollars so we can see a see the numbers that at stake here so without having a strong strategy a direction for our region and our city we will fail in the long term so it 's so important that we clarify our direction so the work on this here can 't happen quick enough and you know the lot of opportunities as we rebuild and we don 't want to miss those opportunities through not thinking about who we are and we want to be in the future so I you know I am going to support this today and I just want to scale of the work and get it done as soon as possible yeah it 's my message to can we go faster so you know no delay when I look at the phasing here given it might be to that kind of leveraging phase you know 10 years so sure it 'll be fluid but I 'd like to think it would happen quicker given what we 've lost so that would be my any question fully supportive otherwise okay yeah Tim there is your supporters of a strategy if you are I 've been stimulus was this was Malcolm 's 2025 destination documented starters ball rolling but if we look at Christchurch we look at the words up their physical cultural and creative SES every city is dies every town even borrow whatever but what makes Christchurch is ecs you need and we 've had unique we 've been you need for a very long time because this council supported having a very strong and house of each team for those of your life 's small to local events which give a silly place to live work and play and then edit to a visitor strategy really makes the whole package and dead as I thank the crucial thing when we started discussing and the noble Jones document which is a very good document we had a one of the examples was an 80 Dan done business and I 've said it a hundred times and I 've loved her as if you can look at what others do and see what they haven 't done well and dodge those you save yourself money on you getting to the end result eater and a short of time and I think that the marriage if you like between our local and smaller events to those major events whether they are the fifa under-20 s or what if they are next under the quest of sparks and you go down and there is where the truth value of our city would be and those two linking so it is essential that we this document by our management teams as discussed that we do include our own in-house staff and give them the right values also v basis that now on the other ones that are dealing with the promoters etc because we and our documents must define technically what a major review does as it announced and John concert I mean but no longer looking at bums on seats I think that this those are the strategy as focusing on that but I 've amassed John hand in hand the album 's journal document did going here it was focused on the airport which is absolutely right because it was their document but we 've got to also open up a visitor strategy that is also for the all South Island anyone that comes in here that 's why I like this document and its starting point as a visitor strategy it doesn 't define where those visitors are coming from and that also includes over the kids based or whatever show I mean whatever deserts are so important that we get it whole picture the next step from this once I hope we all agree with this visitor strategy is that the meat in the sandwich with our staff and those would be based on those other stakeholders and ensure that we 're all going together and the same way that is crucial that we hear that good communication at all certain that we 're going to get there thank you yeah okay everyone 's got one okay resolution I 've got Pauline and then you I think you just very briefly look I support this and and we talk about our city 's air sits in a built in natural environment one of our strongest assets um probably the strongest other people that would live here and since the earth quakes we 've seen a big step up and people with great ideas particularly now our arts and our Performing Arts and it 's about encouraging that and I see we 've addressed that in our strategic aspirations connecting with residents increasing our pride and awareness and encouraging residents to endorse these city but let 's say our city lets us be universal and combined and together on this endorsing our city and growing our city in supporting the locals to attract visitors for instance the column walkway in the coastal perfect all these myriads things that have come from the people themselves our people so let 's keep our people on board with us and connect okay great thank you we 're actually receiving the report on the visitor strategy we 're not adopting the recommendations forward on a model that combines various aspects so comments about the stadium or any other major facility not being changed and this resolution and the thing that was missing from any consideration was the cruise ship terminal which we have added as a measure of urgency for the city that 's what yep all right yeah well we know know you 've already spoken or just technically I can just just technically you can it 's not I 'm gonna if I allowed there oh then I just wanted to point out the prof is that if I have to leave anyone else do this knowledge they 're winners counselors we go we get feedback from classical sparks as great or had a great time at Kids Fest but one of the other wonderful events that we do whether it was kids in town today they 're up staff along dear are the ones that actually deliver that so I 'm please acknowledge them thank you you know know who he said he hasn 't I just I just pretended that nothing happened but we we did offer a 's difficult when we are considering issues like this obviously staff are affected there are a number of different organizations that undertake different components of the roles that form what we do in relation to visitors but at the moment it 's not joined up and having a conversation about the need to join it up is actually always a hard conversation to have and I don 't think that anyone and you know certainly here should in any way consider this a reflection on the quality of the work that we know that our city receives from people within the organization and all of the organizations who work so hard to make sure that tourism events economic development international education that they all happen and that they are all excellent for our city this is actually about joining it up and making the whole greater than the sum of its parts that 's what this is about and and we do need a step change we 've only just got back to the point of visitor arrivals at the airport at the level that they were before the earthquakes the radio yesterday I thought I saw it on the TV last night as an announcement was made about an alternative airline bringing a direct route and to auckland from the west coast of i mean you know gosh I would I would I would just about die of happiness if we had a direct flight to the west coast of America to Christchurch and if you can think about what the capacity that Jimmy chin referred to in his comments the china southern decision from guangzhou to christchurch mattoon that is the best news that 's heard how silly in terms of the strategic direction that this strategy will point to when we do get to a point of adopting the visitor strategy this is a huge step forward and i don 't think that anyone and i 'm responding to those that say can we do it any faster this is not a delay this is actually a stick change we 've accepted that we 've got to align tourism events the large events in particular but yes timmers absolutely right it 's those smaller events that make going to feed into exactly what yarning said which was that if it 's a great place to live that will be a great place to visit just an always the case and so I make actually also going to agree with with Jamie that if it 's a great place to visit usually as a great place to live as well and us getting that combination right and it is a balancing act sometimes that 's going to be really important i think that counselors and put at this stage to highlight the need for the cruise terminal which doesn 't always fit the business case or the proposition that the port company might have it it 's on its agenda it 's absolutely front of mind as far as a visitor strategy goes it 's got to be on the city 's agenda and so that means that we 've got to make sure that these things happen adding in the cathedral square it is absolutely critical that 's the heart of our city so you know i actually think the debates been incredibly positive and helpful it we received Malcolm Jones paper and I believe that by the time we get to the the delivery end of us we will have come up with a strategy that will really be second to none in terms of what else that he can deliver and expect and I just will add that if the Christchurch international airport limited is able to attract more visitors through there through their front door and to our city then the financial rewards will be paid off and reduced rates there is a direct correlation when you 've got a fixed cost asset like an airport so I 'll just make that point to end on and i 'll put the resolution all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you very much _"

    "text": "and so I think leeanne 's coming but I think we 'd better make a start hi and we 're on item so I 'm going to resume the meeting and as soon as Lee and comes I 'll get out of here um we were on item 28 thank you and it was the LDF a directors remuneration um and Steve you 've got a very strange recommendation there I 've actually got an apology to be honest to start with because there 's two items here one is the directors remuneration which is obviously the most sensitive and two is the appointment of directors which is just a standard annual sort of process so I guess the the two recommendation or the two proposals which we 're asking for your opinion on number one to support the recommended increase in directors fees and number two to support the election of directors and whatever you choose would also ask you to authorize Peter gunsel to a point of proxy so that we can express your choice to the LG FA a gem and just by way of background be of the LG fa whose job it is to do if you like the due diligence and be satisfied that the proposals are adequate we haven 't done an awful og diligence ourselves we 're relying on the recommendations of the council right any questions Vicki so it 's not a question it 's a debate so we 'll open it up for debate sorry can I just dumped for clarification because the recommendations work now flicked up to on the on the screen are different from what was in your report and that 's what Steve was talking about earlier in terms of an apology and that we didn 't have all the recommendations and that we need so that the one that would that is just going to be debated as number one about the increase irrespective of that one would still be seeking support and authorization on items two and three which aren 't related to the fee increase their related to the reappointment of directors and the proxies that we can 't vote on them separately so I could put number one separately and then I we have a move on a seconder for the resolution to support the LG FA just problem this was voting yes or no underneath that is that that is the proposal though that 's been put up at the LG FA shareholders Council so we would have to change it to we would have to say that we do not support the LG FA shareholders council proposal and authorize our proxy to to promote an amendment is that right so so if we could change number one this is going to be the council resolution now does not support the LG FA shareholders council proposal that the remuneration be increased by fifteen percent over two years and um and authorizes the council 's proxy to move an amendment to the proposed and crease I 'm the I would propose an increase in line with inflation and mine was relation you 're in line with inflation is that possible yes 2011 so not an increase at the rate of inflation since of his last seat which was 32 hours have these directors fees been in a constant position for a number directors fees who were they haven 't had a formal review like this and I 'm afraid I don 't know if they 've gone up by any kind of inflation figure since first in your report in thressome let 's present endless report and I wonder if it ever will ever get this microphone sort of to you by the way that is it 's written in your report that in 2011 it was see it now the LG fa wasn 't set up in 2011 and i assume they pay directors fees from their diet yes on the right that 's Russell money I know the current directors fees and I know this is the first formal review since 2011 I don 't know what whether the current directors fees are completely unchanged since 2011 we 'll see that they haven 't been reviewed no no subject to review it doesn 't mean that they haven 't had an increase are we quite misleading if they hadn 't well well what they 've used a cemetery laces that is the review that they had by the independent director the twenty three percent so that 's what they 've used a cinch part so what was the increase last year do we know the last time these directors speech were reviewed if we were in a position where the directors fees have not been reviewed for say five years it wouldn 't be unreasonable for a two year period to to actually bring the feeds back into line so that 's information that I 'm I would like to to be in place in receipt of i should say before I would make a call to support a move not to increase the proposed well it 's not reviewed the question you 're asking really is have they been increased because the report says this is the first such formal reviews yes review it 's a formal review yeah so it should be easy enough to find out so what I 'm going to suggest is that the answer to the question is obtained and when we move on to the army just doing that right require us leading though if they were increased and I doesn 't mention different interpretations I just think it 's going a bit far to say it 's misleading so no criticism intended it 's just a question that we 'd like to have an answer to but like it 's just wait until Peters not going to walk back and so let 's move on to the visitor strategy and then we 'll come back once we 've got the answer to the question thank you so item 29 _"

    "text": "before sort of 1210 so I 'm assuming this won 't take very long maybe you 're moving up Pauline seconding Ellie yep just on it there was a new recommendation regarding the empowering the property consultant to go very low engine land exchange arms it 's just we 're thinking detention danza maybe we need to exchange land with the emo lead potentially and so we 've just asked for slight alteration so that 's number three edit is it ok right the any of you got some questions yeah but I really support this work going ahead but I 'm just trying to compare it to the flop turn where there 's heaps of early engagement with local communities and you know there were options are ungodly and this seems to be no public consultation on this so if we make the decision today and we engage with people are we just telling them what 's happening or is there an opportunity for them to have influence over designs over what the different outcomes up to things like trees for example and other issues that we know that designs done will be opportunity for community input there 's been community input through the community will really identify and creative but that is a very non giant crab sorry well let 's just get clear like I 'm talking to community board members and a meeting is not the same as getting the community view from local reasons that are affected and you know there 's no way that I can go and talk to 20,000 people that are affected by this like as an individual counselor that 's impossible as a community board member so the fact that those people don 't have any consultation concerns may but I 'm trying to find a solution going forward so can you just help me understand at what stage if there 's concerns from local residents how we as counselors or community board members can take those into account to inform the final design has happened and Dudley and them which was fair enough one of one of the things you have to remember is that each each project is going to be to be different Dudley had lots of routes and lots of other factors to consider this this particular scheme because of the nature of it has effectively limited number of infrastructure options that can be put forward that will achieve the objectives of a cost effective manner we 've we 've now we 've worked with our consultants to identify preferred options and see the options are largely around repair which is which is straightforward remediation that really has effectively come to a single proposal as you say because of the nature of the land settlement there 's a need for a pump we looking for storage in order it takes on the pressure off the system and so we have to two sites located for that so we are quite limited what we would be doing and expecting is to engage with residents in the area through this this process and as as we develop detail we 've worked very closely with residences we 've got to a stage of Dudley creek and Stapleton 's road as one we work closely with with councillor cotta to meet with residents on site to identify local impact and would seek to continue and that 's something we 've discussed and we 've discussed with the community boards so yes there certainly will be engagement but at this point this is a this is a project where it 's just completed investigations we need now to seek agreement is this a proposal that we take forward and detailed work on and engage with the community I know the second agent ahead was around the Ministry of Education so I would prefer that and it 's interesting that we just had community boards coming talking to us about their disposal they 're actually I think it 's really important that we don 't delegate that decision away because I think the community board or the council should retain oversight of an accountability for waiver so i 'll put that i 'll put that separately and was it possible to amend that so that there is a public process around that in terms of decision making oh let 's can you answer there is a possible question and then I 'll sort out how we take it she hasn 't properly it on and do it as well we took to keep staff agile and flexible to actually achieve delivery of the project we really need to be able to swap land although we 're talking with the m.o.e there could be a resident who actually only wants to dispose of land or a private only only wants to dispose of land by way of an exchange so that resolution enables staff to achieve that in terms of disposal of surplus property if we have to report back to council that the game pushes out the dates for delivery of the project and and that 's the danger the land in question is Linwood park and I think councils already aware of proposals to do some sort of swap there but that in itself is fraught with issues because the land is a reserve and got night home that 's rather a penis so that 's what concerns me is I 'm aware that was always I chose there was concern originally that Walston park would be taken over by the ministry for like yanny what I 'm going to do amendment yes you can um and I 'm trying not to hold up the work that needs to be done but that decisions around things like land swaps and come back to the community board all the council so what 's what 's the best outcome in terms of the council staff well their best outcome as they just explained is that they have the power to do it and so you 're welcome to propose an amendment so how high is this um can I just yeah I 'm add the process of actually disposing of Linwood park is subject to statutory process anyway that requires a public notification ok so then would park can 't_''_408.34 be disposed of in any way shape or form without those processes that 's correct okay is that your major is that what 's underlying you 're just in private property well I 'm happy for just to be private property but I don 't are there any other areas that have major public concern such as Linwood park which obviously is exempt from that caused that are affected at this stage now the swap is only currently proposed for for the m.o.e right thank you okay okay so you 're welcome to propose 1 i 'll put item for separately is there any other debatable no just just a point Vicki that the area perhaps where most people will be affected are in the long head cut river near the outboard it 's clear in the report then in fact those there will be an engagement with that group of people so in think so though that the the area along with is that met with street bet that area that 's at a later stage and those people would be involved too and so where the works are directly affecting people it seems to me from the report then affect people will besides the community boards will continue to be involved okay I 'm plan to put all of the recommendations except for and then i 'll see if i onlys got as amendment not put it separately okay can we go back to the actual we don 't know what the amendment is your sorry Chris can we go back one two three scrolled up a bit 56 ok I can put that those are moved by Councillor and seconded by Councillor Jones just discussion on those I thought the need to get on and get things done I am worried about the cost and I do think again just to repay if we need to formally again resolve some sort of resolution to request government to contribute and you go back to what happened and flop them go back to the comments of the minister and the Prime Minister around waiting for council have got through reports we 've done that it 's really clear that we 've got these issues and I think we certainly should be making it a much more formal request for funding I think the other thing is that you know it 's easy to say well we 'll go and talk to local residents but there 's a number of things in here like consents for heritage buildings for trees etc that can raise a lot of concern so I just hope that through this process i 'm happy to support it but arise that we can actually come back and look at what we can do to mitigate it rather than have what we had in other parts of the city a huge community angst of another trees for example that mature trees special trees that were going to be shut down the other point i 'll just make is that i think it 's it 's really we asked at the workshop around the opportunity for enhanced and we got some quite higher figures and i know that an hour board for example there 's a lot of community groups that would actually you think of charles worth with wetlands that the volunteer contribution to actually enhancing that that area and the transformation that 's happened was fantastic and it 's been really cost effective so i did ask if there was a way in which we could reduce the cost of the enhancement but still do it using those community that community participation model so it 's not formally noted in here we 're going obviously for option one but i do think is an ongoing conversation of nice to with the whole recommendations now no I certainly a Mac I wasn 't well join us speak against it no no no I don 't want I just want to get one two three five and six so I 'm going to put those what five is not yeah just sorry sorry we 've got different recommendation so it 's a bit tricky but so it 's three and I don 't know what 's happened at four always gone down yeah so it 's five is probably the one that was consuming as well okay so you want to take five out as well yeah okay we 'll put four and five separately okay right so one two three and six of move by pauline cinderelly I 'll put those those in favor please say aye those opposed carried and then I 4 and 5 i 'm putting separately as a remover and second day turns moved and seconded is there any amendment and the absence limit yeah then he can put it a foreshadow closure she want this to go ok it would tell us what your amendment can just grow up we don 't we don 't have the written I can 't think yes so it 's basically just to change number 4 and so it 's basically that any decisions to enter to land exchange agreements declaring surplus and swapping council then for privately owned land required for the Volturi flood remediation be a decision for the local community board to council is there a seconder for that just if I can ask a question yep um how much would get slowed the program down it 's knowing that then why normally at some stage 2 because of the consultation can the rest of the works carry on I things on your decision obviously I decided we put in the whole program but you know what we 're trying to do is take on a community consultation process so that we can work through all the issues and that 's why we 've got the community consultation process part of that pretty nose including Colin 's final design so that we can actually take into account there are certain as you 've already heard restrictions declare a surplus Intel we 've got in the first place whether we 've got under Public Works Act whether we young got a gifted and so there are a whole pile restrictions that will be possibly keep the process reasonably unfortunately swollen I think say no and what they 're looking so we will be looking at options that give us the ability to go idea but quite often the whole picture is the solution not but since I 'm going to I 'm going to so it 's moved Yanni seconded Pauline I 'm going to put that amendment which sends these decisions to the local community board to recommend to the council well okay and so I 'm going to put that those in favor please say aye those opposed I 'd clear that lost I 'm going to go back to the original four and five and put those and they are there moved turn and seconded Phil I 'll put those those in favor please say aye those opposed carried and have you got a it 's the amendment yes thank you may do what what do you mean the substantive because you see conduct the amendment be converting instance yes so you see good for a former taking it for discussion okay that 's fair right and do you want to do the proxy just before we finish _"

    "text": "whoo thank you very much indeed guys and that takes us two nights train okay okay somebody moves yeah but poorly moves both ten seconds you need about lots of debate um Keith did you want to say anything this you Keith Dave Tom any of you want to say anything yes just by way of introduction so we have the night stray in concept design this is one of the first investigation projects within the land range recovery program to work its way through the initial investigations it 's referred here from the infrastructure transport Environment Committee the recommendation is for option one remediation that includes a proposed pump station and rising mayen remediation of existing storm water basin modifications tonight 's drain and as a second stage detention storage within y nani park the proposal is intended to largely return flood risk to pre quake levels it does that with above floor flooding not doesn 't get it quite back with foundation flooding but there 's a quite significant improvement on what we have post-quake the whole area is low lying and has dropped post-quake and is most believed to be in the order of 11 million dollars and we 're seeking approval to progress to detailed design okay thank you other it just before we having debate is there any questions Glenn first info me Annie thank you thank you for this I 'm not a member of the Edit committee and I wasn 't privy to the discussion there so just with regard to the works aside from the storm water basin dear envisage much by way of community and convenience I ask this against the background of a lot of intensive roadworks in that area lately which have been going on for some time and will be still so yes so my wave inconvenience so in n Night 's Dream the sum of the the problem we have is that the existing pump station is in Reds on land so relocation of the the pump station that is required because the the area is actually sits below normal high water level the stub banks protect so we need a pump station to to pump the water through that 's pulled back outside of the red the new pipe through the red zone obviously isn 't affecting residents directly they works around one only Park obviously we will consult with widely it 's a reserve and we need to do that so that 's the main if I may ask the main kind of in terms of community and convenience it 's mainly the stormwater retention basin in y nani park I you anticipate still some supposed works on nights train itself many of those have already been undertaken posts and private others which is in private property behind yet those profits on pages wrote so there were some local and convenience likely for some of those reasons okay Minister small work around the living the scale make mature man ok ok thank you felt so mine I think Green has asked a very good question around the the wine only part part some- came from the report and will be discussion it 's a bit that part which will be used as a detention beta basement is flooding in fact that sort of like a second stage we the other other work will be done that we would with with your agreement to progress we will fast-track the stage one proposals and we will follow a more conventional process and with consultation for y nani park there 's requirements being a reserve to to do that and so that we 're not able to fast track those elements of it so there will be separate work thanks Keith it 's not the whole of wine only perk is that it will be a part of it yes yeah so it 's not the whole part we don 't people going there yes certainly not from the existing sports field here is its and the northern component apart which is currently from times it 'll open space bacteria right okay jaani and thank you for the work you 've done on this um a question that people have raised with may watch um I just think it 's important that we get clarified is because this is earthquake related and because EQC are responsible for fixing land damage why are we paying for when EQC akash set lone individual homes and what contribution are we getting effectively picking up the cost of what should be a key C and given that this is f coke related to things we did approach EQC and about trying to lock that money together that could help us do that and those agreements didn 't come there was no way that counted before sir hiki see one way or the other they wanted to resolve the liabilities and they resolved in a different way secondly there is some subsidy towards us from the cost share agreement on posh parts allah so we have got an agreement around damaged infrastructure and we are if you have a look at the independent assessment asking the government for another discussion around the whole of the land drainage program those discussions of we 've had a couple of prelim discussions but that 's purely being at an officer liberal today okay sorry just so I 'm clear so individual property owners get compensated by eq c for the increased flooding risk and they take that money and they can do what they like with earth there 's no requirement on them to fix the fix the land that comes from rates where are hoping that we 'll get some contribution through the cost share but it says here Kashia contribution is not expected to significantly of set the total cost to counsel for the project so I assume we 're not getting any you know we 're not getting much from that process so is there anything formally we should be doing as part of approving these reports today to formally again request government to actually contribute financially all I would say is the mirror is actually having discussions with the minister regarding the negotiations and as you 're aware of the independent sister said that those conversations are needed to happen around the land drainage problem the issue that you 've got is if you look at the wedding of the Act talks about essex damaged councils assets damaged it doesn 't actually talk about issues to relating to the land that makes accounts wes it 's different so it 's actually not a black-and-white issue but all I can say is that we are pursuing that and in every avenue that we I take this as actually council is pulling in a system some physical works to actually take the move your way we 're not actually remediating people 's private property so that 's the difference yani this is actually removing the water so they don 't flood rather than EQC money might be given to a private property to actually lift the house up for Gracie Lenny something but we 're not doing that this is a different this isn 't publicly sex group yes nothing 's going price for just a clarification in each you see phones funded out of a targeted rate on people 's policies clicker e eq c is a living that is on people 's insurance agree so the eqc payouts for loss of land value secret well I 'm sorry I it doesn 't matter what doesn 't really what does a lot yeah it 's not leaking so she 's like well it is associate a payment for loss of them yep I think the point at pauline 's made is yeah right ok I 'm going to put it unless there 's it because I think this is a large project and others may wish to too but I want to thank the staff for you know all the full investigative work you have done and clearly night Bells creaking Mike strange stand out as priority projects and the workers urgent i have to say when i heard and saw the heavy rain last night i was pleased in fact i expect that we will pass us today and and like in this is more than for example skin will be doing the option of just a straight to appear which would have been like like4like the committee did not recommend the committee recommended that the full remediation option because that is the most cost effective for both both projects and so like these projects further for the people who live in this area they will have lessons because though that this will return that the flood sort of levels if you like to pre at least what was a good thing before the earthquakes so in that way this not only improves our environment that it improves people 's well-being and pleased that we have the chance now to sign off this report on an effect it 's like a fast-track basis from now to thank you right I 've got focally and Pauline days thank you yes thank you for this piece of work just from the perspective of the board liaison on the actors the trustee ER immediately adjacent to Y nani park and which has ongoing significant contact with the community can I suggest we either note or recommend that we engage both actors and the community board early in the piece by way of messaging and the process around the messaging the area 's been subject to intensive road works for some time and still will be and I think it would be prudent to actually get them on board right now the community will be grateful the land has dropped significantly and but I do suggest you take the community with you so already evident yes so we have stuff here Sarah 's our communication lead and working very hard to ensure that all those groups are identified and that we have a good communication strategy to ekta seats you have okay yeah are here to be clean it hasn 't come up Pauline in a nice and I do I 'm here what clean is saying and it must reiterate again the level of importance that the working group is pulling on the communications in the really good job that Sarah is doing the usf and identify the people to communicate with and doing and so I mean this is like I have to reiterate it also the massive size of this project the land recovery drainage recovery program covers the entire city of christchurch there are 79 kilometres of rivers 160 kilometres of tributaries lined and unlined drains 130 kilometres or storm water pipe networks 790 kilometers so you can see when you when you think about that what a mess of task it is and why the investigative stage is taking so long and that it is an integrated program it 's not just a piecemeal thing so it 's really exciting to see these physical weeks starting to come online so this we 've had the Dudley one which was a completely of how to do it but the heath cut and the in and out here there 's limited options we have and here we have three options within the one type of treatment with them related to costings more which is a repair a mediator enhance and we 've we 've chosen recommended remediation so it 's a really really challenging job here and its really really encouraging to see that the houses are now going to be beginning to be remediated and reduce the risk of having water coming inside I mean the the social impact of that happening is just too too great a risk we have to get these things going so I do i do want to reinforce that the the comms is working on it communicating with people they 'll have an opportunity to probably have a direct person to speak to if they have any issues or problems or even ideas so it 's going to be a collaborative process worst residence and those affected will be worked with very closely so once again you know the staff are doing such a good job that have any you know issues with groups they think might not have been communicated with just let us know because that 's the aim of the going to keep take people with us and get this going so thank you Dave did you I speak thank you look I just like to come in the work that staff have done on this project I actually went for we bike wipe down the stock bank the other day and the the existing pump station is quite low behind that behind the bank and look in that lower reaches of the avin there are a number of old stormwater drains that go through that used to go through the old stock banks they had flaps on the end of them they don 't work and I think you know a lot of the land in that area has dropped considerably and we will be faced with the prospect of having public stations lifting lifting water and pumping it into the avin so this is the first of a big approach this big project in the area there will be some others working a long time on a pumping station there that 's again lifting water from low-lying areas back into the oven and so there will be a few other projects of a similar nature that will need to be undertaken sir look I will be supporting this motion and again just express my thanks to the work that has been done today great okay so i 'll put the motion those in favor please say aye those opposed carried thank you I 'm bells _"

    "text": "thank you food you would say something I like Angus is to the so I just like so the intention behind us is that like I 'm firstly I 'm very supportive of what the proposed process that was brought to the board and but I think that it 's missing a step and so the ball to motivation is so that before win-win_,_35.78 the asset holder oh no what thinks that something is operationally redundant to them that it kept their community boards are involved in the conversation at that point before it goes out to the other units of council so that boards actually have some input into that at that at that point now this may not be the way of dealing with that and I know that the policy is under review but I do think that is important that community boards are involved at the earliest point of a discussion around local assets and whether they have redundant or not okay so do you want some staff to speak oh you were surfing so is through a discussion that the definition of operation you redundant about a collaborative process and what that means but also the decision around changing policy needs to be a council decision so what we will do is bring back a paper to council around what a process might be and what the implications are there are so there is a report being prepared and civil but that that this has come up a number of community boards is everybody okay with it that we actually have a paper on the proceeds un debate it yeah okay Tim yep suggests its poor mention there once a unit has decided that it doesn 't need which does not require such a community boards be treated like every other units own its second tier decision so the first is the unit doesn 't need it the second carrier decision is putting out two units but could the community board in their area be also included in succeed in it that 's exactly what I meant yes we all know we 're going to make that decision based on a paper I just saw Alex yeah spill it is that 's exactly what I number of community board sexually yep so everybody happy with their process yep focus so that when the policy is being drawn out that stamp staff I 'm sure I 've been across this are looking at the best way forward for example there are often budget implications so getting the process right is important I think it 's also equally important that that in fact community boards are treated as part of council one council look at one team working together that kind of thing next one so one so I got food though I 'm speak I 'm speaking really just too I guess confirmed that councillors to have a strong interest in making sure that community boards are involved right at the beginning and I 'm sure Angus has got some comments he can terrify the process of where it 's up to at the stage if we need anything I don 't really think despite me enjoy the shirt i really don 't know that Angus needs to because we 're going to get a whole paper on it which he 's probably gonna get you spoke to see I was going to come to the frontal judge please put your sunglasses oh dear ah um I don 't think it 's got a value of ye am try and clarify this discussion but I did draft an alternative resolution I think which i think would serve everybody well does it deals with a number no I think what we 'll do is do it properly and actually have have a paper and then you can draft paper or whoever can drop the paper yeah no no we 'll do it with a blob of a movie yeah yep sorry sure it wasn 't quite good enough for that okay right so so the suggestion is that this go this will be the subject of a separate report to Council okay jaani yes so activity management plan says that will request a workshop to review that operationally redundant property and provide an indication of which ones they would be prepared to declare circle surpass that means us as counselors and sell without going through the process of determining future yo site so that could perhaps be want to take I just wanted to check whether that yeah what we 've currently got an activity management plan can be part of that report that comes back around the process for those ones that have also take a kind of thing the prostitute program with Lillian big boppers which is actually I can diaf I 'm dealing with a list of potential properties in male mane the process of the policy community visibility or what into the sphere in engaging it prices but there 's also a turnaround what currently okay and that 's going to be a workshop what you 're saying yani is that there is a workshop planned in the activity management plan and you would like that to happen so the excellent management plans is that we won 't go through the normal process of just property disposal but for the ones that are listed and they 're actually I did talk about this going to eat some of the community here 's one young is looking at here is a draft somebody management plan okay thanks okay thank you so maybe we could verifying yeah cuz I guess we 'll put that out yeah yeah we were okay okay clean did you want to join the community would anguses rd looks quite good from a housing perspective but just chatting with paul sequentially would be better i think to wakefield so we 've got we 've got a report coming yeah yeah in a way and okay is there anything and discussing the general concept always seem to be doing really that they needs to be early what went on the community boards is any decision about declaring a property operationally redundant we 're simply asking staff to bring a report back which has got that either as a recommendation or an option in that report and we 're sending a signal as a result of the debate in this meeting that we want to see an opportunity for early involvement of community boards in that process and that 's really a snapshot of the way that I see it which I thought i would say because it might be helpful so just in terms of the resolution that should be before us should it be and any requests that staff because we 've got a board recommendation on page 113 is I can I cheek with a ball chair is that what the board would still like council to decide on so sorry it 's a new a new format to the reports so the board recommendations the beginning that I 'm pay within unless that 's what 's being discussed and I don 't but all the outcome is that the new probe that we want is a new process to have something like what we 're asking which is what I agree with what andrew has said I don 't I 'm happy for that to be incorporated into the report as long that the outcome is that it is considered and given as an option and the report that would be good okay so how about with the cards worth staff to supply a report on the options for including community boards when considering is it potentially operationally with other properties of you want their wedding actually yeah said okay did you get that dress that that 's that boards been considering and the disposal of any properties or the future of ombre always potentially be like you 're talking about before it 's on okay I 've potentially operationally redundant properties for our options for including community boards and then just and then just yeah take that bit out awesome okay yep can you how can you run really or you can you see all right yep yep okay to report on the entire process so do you like to go and give that to you Chris and that clear that includes community pool as long as it 's clear that include community yeah yep you 're very clear on that aren 't you re and then Angus yep as well for key to stay out of the rock Consuela 's let 's do the general report yeah well they have it for that report that 's working okay right are we good with this moved that ah sorry so picky let 's go get you to move it ok ok cut said pull stuff I see before me yeah okay move to turn seeking did fall I 's more about weight that we actually get this right in your important policy the community boards have complained about it for years at yeah yeah yeah and this is an attempt to get it right that 's mostly why you can on the room what to consider the resolution which has been put up by the staff and that 's fine but we need to get it right right there you go the three P 's and opportunity no only two now okay um yeah I 'd like to strengthen what we 've got in front of as if we can by using the wording which is in the board recommendation to make sure we adopt at the border asking for so what we could say is so future use decision and including options for asset owning units to consult with community boards when considering the future of potentially operational redundant properties so it captures exactly what the community board are asking for and i 'm sure this border not on their own in requesting this because i 'm very aware of other examples where this hasn 't worked board this actually does that andrew of which facilitates community board involvement at the earliest practicable opportunity so it may be even ahead of that you may you may be achieving more than watch Paul 's asking for yeah all right as long as we can be confident that they 're exactly a sense of what the community border has that very very happy boy world there 's a difference between facilitating involvement and consulting but as long as we can be comfortable that will capture the essence of being of course do they don 't happen okay move to the second deport I 'll put those in favor please say aye those opposed carriage thank you and then _"

    "text": "right next fearwood pegasus community board item team Andrea you just want one thing I 'd like to just update you on would be some place if you remember last time I came and spoke with you guys about without Amberson we 've discovered some areas of residence that the only access to the properties is driving through red zone and here 's a red zone appeal is not very wonderful so we 've had some real good opportunities to liaise with the residents and staff have been very very helpful in that yesterday we had a public at a meeting with a couple of representatives from some place in a number of staff members and we just came to an absolutely fantastic result for the residents who are able to find some TP footpath solutions for them because at the moment they have to walk down the middle of a pothole road which is far from ideal to get out of there out of their street so it was just a really good example of I guess thinking outside the square to come up with some solutions for people the opportunity we 'd identified Landy Street was another street that was a very similar sort of situation and so we invited the whole street to come in again which street in landhi street and yelling again and ellington Meredith and and that was really great to have a chance to connect with those residents and in find some solutions and that they were really positive in pragmatic and by having that chance to have that one-on-one with them about specifically the area and their issues was really empowering for them because they have been left with a lot of unknowns you know as we know nothing 's happening in the red zone and we don 't know of any time lines and that kind of things had to be able to give them some temporary solutions and a bit more information was was fantastic so so certain place landy street now sorted fixed and not not sorted faxed but a lot more pleasing x in the meantime right yeah and there was another one that was raised in kingsbridge well that that had that had probably a more permanent a road through so that one was a different facts these ones that that solution isn 't available is obviously although the lean District one we didn 't identify a couple of houses which we may be able to do that similar solution to so start we 're going to investigate that but that still takes time so this is a system now you know they can 't get out there straight to that breaking their ankles or at risk of it Thank You Glenn just to say I recommend it as the prices for any community board with difficult issues just to be free of the shackles of normal community board meetings with 10-minute deputations get resident staff elected reps around the table literally and to talk issues through the residents were really grateful even over some of the you know some of those issues there are fairly straightforward some are more sticky but they 're just grateful to be heard and that 's what they say so particularly in the more damaged kind of woods along here with roading issues I really recommend that as a process yani 't_''_186.93 be done because of budget constraints because i know because i 've raised other similar sites sports fields for example that i 'm told that we can 't do anything because there 's no budget and we 're waiting for the future the red zone yeah that there is that that all the final solutions can 't we can go the air until we even more serious but even at e3 ones are they constrained by budgets no i think these ones were quite quite extreme that that staff were able to find budgets they realized that this was there was serious health and safety have you got shoes any idea what the costs associated uh uh what was that footpath was twenty thousand i think the budget was but what happened was staff decided that one a sheltered footpath would be provided but the in discussion with the residence they she decided that actually rather have to grab all compacted grabber ones would be a really global solution so we talked about it was good yeah so that 's probably in a safe council money it 'd be that 's okay can I just ignore a question for the CEO the process for us to get temporary works done no because it 's not on this you can do it at a different time but not as part of the subject so injectors really like to compliment you and your board I 'm being proactive and the way you 're working with the resonance in particular in this situation yeah I think it 's tremendous an example you know of your ball being proactive and clearly that information will come back possibly to air infrastructure transfer Environment Committee I 'm a new sorry I couldn 't make it yesterday yeah so well thank you for that it 's been quite an iron i think for staff as well I think sometimes they deal with things on paper and their office in to sit there for two hours and listen to what the residents are loving through was was quite important I think for them to to have that understanding and I think it helped them will help them do their job better and some of the decisions they at morning tea time okay right can I put the report cancel receive the report moved clean signal Dave hey put that those in favor

    "text": "carried nets that report as a whole we do we do have to receive the report we don 't have to now okay thank you and moving on to thanks Pam very much and moving on to limit amount to a bit Paula what honor hi so there 's just three things I 'd like to highlight in our minutes first is the deputation that we had which is another example of issues arising from the processes around dealing with operationally redundant lend and that 's an area of about 40 hectares of freehold land that 's up behind diamondharbour which has always been earmarked for future residential growth but part of it has been planted and my local group and they are seeking to reserve it and so and the reason this has come to a head now is is because that property appeared on the list of operation redundant properties the second thing is on on page 38 the diamond harbour reserves management committee and many of the people involved in the deputation are also involved in this this was the inaugural meeting of our most recent reserve the last year one at kes bay and this one new one here at Diamond Harbour which brings the number of reserve management committees in littleton mount hoovered up to five and we see that that these reserve management committees have a great deal to offer in terms of working with council and partnership to manage our local reserves and finally item 7 on page 38 the autumn brady park board minutes the letters and amount here at community board and the arka-dal wider were community board representatives from both of those met this week with members of the autumn bradley park board and had a useful walk around and familiarization of a site visit and I know that the autumn Brady park board would really like to host the council at some stage at autumn bradley park at some point in the future of it was ever possible it 's a great great asset to the city wasn 't ready for rhododendrons a spot on well I know they 've tried in the past and hidden have much luck so and I think you might just want to take a number of such requests I 'm sure why but I think a principle that we actually get out and visit some of these places is really important so and as you could drive in the past okay okay how about we just put that motor discussion on Monday for some of the places that people have invited us through can 't go outside of the council it 's quite OHS are there any questions about any other measures of just the land in diamondharbour how much of it is in our planted I can 't_''_189.41 say exactly because it 's not a separate title but I would say it would be twenty percent oh well no twenty percent is fenced it 's a there 's a series of three galleys and what this is one of the gullies okay thanks yep so thanks for you you talk very positively about reserve management committees on annual bawdy area and I 'm just wondering in terms of future delegations to strengthen community boards is that a concept which you think might also work for community boards in a certain in the boards and metropolitan parts of the city establishing reserve measurement committees now because all the community board does is delegated to razzoos responsibilities to the reserve management committee it 's useful for us to know thanks for okay so and removes and Jimmy seconds put the council received the report received motion and put put that those in favor please say aye those opposed carried thank you thank you very much indeed boy _"

anything could happen right ok this is the bank 's peninsular visitor signage and interpret eight interpretation signage which looks great and you 've got a resolution there and which Andrew would like to move and clean would like to seek or Paul would like to see them sorry and any debate questions I 'm really pleased that this work has been done it 's long overdue in the interpretation panels and led a lot the what the one for the dentist botanic gardens I 'm assuming that that 's aligned with what he be packs staff are doing just want to make sure we had some questions on that as well and we 've had some feedback from staff and location of the sign was fully discussed and determined and agreed on with botanic gardens management team the phone location is on botanic gardens reserve not within the road corridor Park retain at gardens master plan but it 's considered to be the most appropriate location for the sign while in the city well the city 's in recovery mode simile is there Christchurch visitor center eyesight which isn 't normally the botanic gardens but currently hazards temporary accommodation here the staff agreed with the start with the design of the interpretation panel yep they agree with the siting of it so I thought sighs yeah and right right i mean the design was was done a long time ago that 's right now okay click sir mmm I 'm just gonna speak to ya you 're very welcome look can you mind if you wonder why we 're sticking a banks peninsula sign at the gates benefit of our pathetic gap that 's what I 'd like to point out to the members here today is that we have a million visitors are go through the Botanical Gardens every year that has continued place to earthquake those million visitors will be exposed to some of our fantastic backyard which is banks peninsula and if that provides an opportunity for go and visit a wonderful backyard I 'm a highly supportive site is usual to support putting this place on the signs out there which we can certainly have a couple of years we 've now got the opportunity to do it but also on a peasant Botanical Gardens I think it 's really important that we actually highlight yeah one of the backyard so please support today I don 't think anybody 's not going to Yanni and then injury yeah I just kind of had a concern and to me this is like putting a sumner sign in the middle of cathedral square I don 't_''_169.02 I don 't_''_169.98 I just I love the science I 'm very supportive of the design and all the work that 's gone into them and I completely understand them going in the areas that they 're named about what I just I guess what confuses me about this one is that how do people know given that they 're not in begs minute so when they see a bank sponsor sign in the central city that it 's making reference to good got a you are here as far as I 'm aware it 's visit its relationship with a visit to see ya so I mean I 'm just having my vote specifically recorded against this individual one I support all the others I do think it is very unusual to have a sign making reference to an area that 's not in that area because of the locational nature of this of the side so my suggestion that the board was that they could be integrated into that visitor center and I would have no problem with that but it does seem going in a prominent place right next to us honest is Christchurch Botanic Gardens Thanks Peninsula it just seems really out of place and I mean as I said I have no issue with these signs I actually love this project I love the work that 's gone into it in terms of informative colorful interesting signs I just personally don 't feel that this particular sign actually accurately reflects its location and should be in a different place I 'll put the I 'll put that I just think it 's a fantastic opportunity as Paul said you know like it 's a very clever use of we 've got an area which is beautiful and get a million tourists to add that to take that opportunity but also I think their history and insurance of the link to the visitors center with that sign that 's always to the you know the weakest loan to the lowest common denominator but I think it is an absolute fantastic opportunity and we as a city and its community boards and as counselors and a staff have to actually up take more of this opportunity so I think it 's a great great opportunity to take up okay hey drew thank you um well first of all I 'd like to acknowledge the positive comments that have been made by my city councilor colleagues about the nature of banks peninsula and the economic development opportunities that it program represents and also the opportunities for environmental cultural touristic experiences and I think that 's exactly the reason that we do need promotional signage in the city center where we boating what after all is a part of the Christchurch City Council territorial area it 's entirely appropriate in my view that we would be doing there as the representative recep representative about banks peninsula of course I would be saying that but I think everybody would agree these excellent signs they look absolutely fabulous the other frustration around this for me is length of time this particular piece of work has taken this started off under the banks peninsula District Council which I think demonstrates how long it 's taken us to get to the point that we 're at making a final decision on this today for that reason if no other I would urge counselors to support option 1 the recommendation so that we can get on with getting these signs which have already been manufactured and which are in store in storage ready for installation installed as soon as possible so that the peninsula and the city can start to get the full benefit of this promotional information and so that people can realize what a fantastic environment we 've got right on our doorstep and ok great can we put it and i 'll put i 'll just put recommendations 129 and the about five at the stage okay i 'll put five separately afterwards okay with it so one two four and six to nine it 's moved and by someone moved andrew and seeking to pull I 've got it already okay off with those in favor please say aye those opposed carried and then item number five moved Andrews ticketed Paul again I 'll put that those in favor please say aye those opposed carried if you want your vote record against it Annie right okay and so they _"

people on the song pegu visit so welcome forward everyone who 's going to do talking follow you starting this once you get past Ellie and Ellie 's doing the slideshow alien welcome he 's going to introduce my gorgeous assistant only Jones but I think you might know her already my name is felt happened and I 'm the chairman of the song pegu Christchurch sister city committee and it was my pleasure to be part of a trip that went to song path in September to recognize the signing of the 20th anniversary of the signing of the sister city agreement which I believe was lead by E deputy Emir back I 'm terrible how you pass catchers office at the same time councillor Jones assisted by sue mcfarland went and visited the embassy and did some Civic work there we have a little slide show that 's been worked first slide it shows how small the room that I was standing in is missing as song part children 's library all right so that 's the word that fell off very good it 's always read which is amazing there are a number of people who joined the delegation to song including pneumonia itani the kapa haka group who performed with a Korean dance a song he come and if you were lucky enough to be a Korean day last year you would have seen a similar performance absolutely stunning there are a number of Christchurch educators who attended the Kerak study abroad fair and soul in the education New Zealand events the workshop and alumni reception and there were two groups representing schools there was a horrible school group and the global student to china in korea which in consists of students from case rocking cobham joachim who 's a local korean to the vice president of the crotchet korean society was also there representing the korean society so all in all there were 58 people from Christchurch went to song over the period of the the back mcfarland went to launch events for the new zealand festival and for the festival in korea we admit the ambassador and one of her key messages was that song power is not far from china or japan so if any delegations are heading over there they would love to see more amusing and put into the Korean market the end for four and a half days we were hosted in song following the success of mia parks visit last November to Christchurch they regard Christchurch as song has best sister city and the walks of the Welcome that was given to councillor Jones and the group was beyond anything I 've ever seen in my work with Korea and they 're very keen to enhance sister city relationships further they 're very keen to work with the City Council and with the sister city committee and I would like to recommend that that 's something that we continue to look at I 'd like to introduce a number of people who come up and speak very quickly i 'm speaking very quickly and they might was limited the first one group who represented Christchurch you start off by telling us we that was oh I 'll kill the tattoo featured more turning them money I Tommy so that was our first performance for the New Zealand embassy and it was to open the new zealand festival with a harmony dinner the idea behind that particular performance or their particular event was to showcase New Zealand to the media so it was just more media presence and we have this famous actress korean actress that came along and to be part of partaking in a harmony dinner you would have seen and Ellie 's photos before the media went wild and our photos and video clips of us just means worldwide within minutes and it was a showcase New Zealand really really good so we were lucky to be part of it sonu monu attorney one of the senior couple groups of Christchurch and just first we 'd like to thank the Korean Committee crush City Council the mirror in concerns for even have come along we really really enjoyed it beneficial for us as a group as well also first have the opportunity to share our culture and our performances with a newfound far no in Korea was awesome and just like to thank you all for that that opportunity and we also look forward to a long term relationship with the City Council in the Korean Committee killed her thank you very much indeed thank you that they were an absolute cut and there were fantastic representatives for Christchurch and New Zealand and it was it was a pleasure to be associated with them when you performed and from the back Jeff Estill in front of probably six to eight thousand people there were people with tears in their eyes when they brought out the Korean and kiwi flag at the end together as an amazing performance absolutely amazing so thank you one of the other things that we were going from of course was to look at education and educational relationships and so we have two people here who represent two different sectors and the first is car liver the Carl Everett who is the international director of Christchurch boys high school and secondly Beth knows the international be here I 'm Carl Everett so from Christchurch boys high school i 'm a board member of christchurch educated and on new zealand schools reference group and president of New Brighton um we just had put that play then nice to see it nice to see a day so we decided about a year ago that a group of us here in Christchurch would focus on career and primary secondary and tertiary a group that were really focused on trying to get things going again in career and education we 're meeting regularly and we decided to go along with this delegation and which coincided with the co it 's fear in Seoul and the Enz at events and and try and figure out why they 've been a decline and student numbers some of things we talked about were the fact that you know that the experience and christchurch at the moment as we rebuild as it 's difficult to emulate that that you get in some of the bigger cities such as auckland and the experience includes the korean mothers you know who often come with with a good experience while they 're here in christchurch and that 's a really key aspect of it so we were looking at how the tertiaries and the secondaries could could link together to try and promote the experience for both we also talked about equivalency of NCAA you know the recognition of NCAA in Korea is quite limited and that 's crucial you know often the Korean students look for things such as IB and Cambridge programs which they get in other parts of the world and although NCAA is still as relevant it 's not recognized and a bit of work needs to be done around that um so just a summary of how things went over there we found it you know more positive than it has been so obviously you know I was there just after the the earthquakes and basically we had to chase after agents to try and get them in the room but we feel now that they 're actually starting to come into the room that starting to have those conversations they 're starting to see you know what 's happening with opportunity available in Christchurch and so that in general we got it quite a good feeling from that a lot of those agents still aren 't in the room so we know we need to find ways of getting them in there and often when they are in the room they are looking at those flights direct and to Auckland and they 're not looking much further than that so the bit of work needs to be done around them as well it 's it 's crucial I think for us the the again zeit events the cutter hyper group I 'm absolutely amazing and collaboration between the Korean and and New Zealand cultures and their performance was just amazing having councillor Jones there as well was was also it had a great impact although the Auckland providers weren 't quite so happy that you were there we scored a very good spot at one of the sessions where we played a phenomenally amazing promotional video of Christchurch and I tell you what you could have cut the air with a knife in that room yeah they weren 't so that and it is crucial that we work together education and City Council to have an impact in these places and so that we can really showcase what we 've got anyway so that 's probably enough for me yes I 'm Cal really hasn 't left a lot for me to say but I would just like to thank the City Council for the support that you gave us I think the most fantastic thing about this whole event was that we had so many sectors from Christchurch and Canterbury that were represented and so we made a huge impact in the media a huge impact with our education agents and as councillor john said that video went down really well with our agents and soul and they were agency from other parts of South Korea as well they are incredibly important to us and raising the number of students and I think we are going in the right direction with export education we have now this year achieve nine percent of the market share in New Zealand last year we were eight percent so we 're going in are incredibly important to us get back to pre youthquake levels at cpit we have gone past this year with the numbers of students that we had in 2010 so were incredibly excited about that and that 's going to make a huge economic impact on the city so thank you very much for your support it 's really much appreciated and it was great to have cancer the Giants they made a big difference thank you okay thank you though ripping through this I

questioned educated for giving us the very fashionable t-shirts we could sport around in Korea and China we thought it was a really cool experience and we loved it whoa kalam it was quite good by a amount of people we did at the back toe festival and just meeting all the people and all the koreans and make chinese people very very nice till the white people the very fond of our skin and hide I

had the traditional lunches walking around with them very very good experience thank you thank you very much to eat and that 's the end of the formal speeches I would just like to say if I of this delegation and it was an honor to be accompanied by councillor Jones who worked tirelessly during your timely I 'm always amazed by how much representatives of the city take on board when they 're on these kind of visits I 'm sure you 'll be hearing a lot about planter pots and shade and walking through the 80s fifth story of an unbuilt unfinished building which was something that it was pretty scary for all of us I would also like to acknowledge the help of the New Zealand embassy education New Zealand and of course the song pegu City Council who looked after us remarkably well just on one little last note if I 'm a sitting behind us at the back TFS before were representatives from Berlin Germany who are hoping to enhance the assister City relationship with song and I had an email and see would have had 12 this morning asking if we can get in touch and talk to them about how we run such accessible programs and especially such successful student exchange programs so i really do think we do things 's a credit to the people who work in schools the support of places like the song sister city committee and of course the support of our city council so thank you very much indeed I don 't know if you have time or wish to ask any questions anyone they may wish to but make sure your instead of 10 minutes that 's gone 30 and it 's been it 's been lovely or I might just get on to the counselor Daisy thank you very much for you thank you very much and thank you to all of the people who came in with you and Dave Vicki I just want to thank Phil very quickly because seriously I think somewhere there is a stunt double because I don 't know how he manages to do the stuff he does as a principal you know the work he does with the sister city committee and especially with the Korean connections as well so thank you phil and of course and son who was our translator the whole time we were there which was extremely helpful otherwise i 'd you what we 'd like to thank you all

    "text": "this morning which I 'm going to be an apology for for the first part of so the deputy mayor will lead off the council meeting this morning there is a important groundbreaking ceremony on for the earthquake National Memorial this morning with the Prime Minister and the the cofactor Heidi of of night ah who Marc Solomon and it 's a three-way partnership so it is my intention to be there with them this morning so I do give my apologies for the late of meeting we 're under a reasonable pressure of time here but what I wanted to do was start off by saying congratulations to councillors end staff who have woot phenomenally over the last couple of days just to get those tidy up Stu the boundaries and the boundaries are now looking very very good so I think that I think we 're probably in a position to resolve that the city be divided into the six forwards name below with boundaries has shown on the maps and reflecting identified communities of interest says follow so we have circulated to you the full list of as burwood kashmir pendleton lynnwood central halls will hornby here we 'll hear word yet here was coastal riccarton papanui and sprayed on and and that and if you turn that sheet of paper over what you 'll find is that that notes that the population that each member will represent us as follows and you 'll see that they are all were than the the quota is that we 're within the threshold except for banks peninsula which is a glaring a glaring exception to the rule but we knew that it would be a glaring exception to the rule the local government commission may or may not accept this it is something that the local government Commission will decide and I think I just want to kind of repeat this because there 's obviously been a little bit of chatter on Facebook as they 're normally is with these sorts of measures that get report just simply to make the point that the council was legally obliged to do this we were legally obliged to look at bringing banks peninsula into the city the overwhelming weight of submissions as part of a city ward but to have it as its own separate ward as it is now and and as a result we 've spread the communities of what we 've kept communities of interest together very carefully across the city so I think we 've done a really good job faced with the obligation that we have at this particular time so but this all goes out for public notification once it 's signed off next week and once it 's publicly notified the people who made submissions on it can submit again and this time it goes to the local government Commission because there is the glaring anomaly of banks peninsula there will be a hearing and it will be here in christchurch so there will be an opportunity for further discussion about about the challenges that our city faces with a representation review at this time so the the real debate today i believe will be how we group them as community boards and that 's a separate sheet of paper which you also have in front of you i 'm not sure do they you 'll see that there are three options there and the option that probably has the most equal numbers is really option two which sets up a separate ward for central and there are those that have I mean that bank sponsor at the exception obviously in this particular instance you 'd end up with with nine Ward 's though so so it 's just a question of how people feel about that I don 't you know as I say I 'm really open to what we what we put out there obviously people will be able to make submissions through to the local government Commission and of course option 3 has only seven community board so and that 's because there are three groupings of three and two groupings of two so I just ask you to turn your attention to those I think that 's what the focus of the debate will be on but if people are genuine genuinely happy with the work that 's been done then i would like to look for a mover of the resolution Andrew seconded option no no no we the city be divided into the 16 wards name below you 'll move there and seconded by tum NE debate Yanni oh it 's just um just some clarification and that some of the communities of interest are duplicated in two wards so just need to none of it 's because they are we divide them by bush walk so these are these descriptions are of census eerie units okay in the Serious Eats a 0 units are sometimes divided there 's different mesh blocks and doing we need to know the census eerie units or it 's just a way to get people visible easiest description this is the description that we 're dealing with today we 'll have the formal resolutions that we put to the council next week you know that 's fine i think maybe maybe we could just put them noise and because when people read it you know we had a number of submitters just to note down the bottom just explaining what you 've just said i think i would just be okay so an explanation explanation i think that 's very helpful Jimmy just remember that the questions its twenty to nine to you you have questions at this time last time whether we have already voted a 16 small war yes yes what we do a difference remember we went away to do the boundaries the boundaries have been done the boundaries have been done there have been some retweeting yeah sorry I thought I 'd explain this we 've done some retweeting of the bound yes everyone has been incredibly helpful I think we 've got a good result here the boundaries look like they have met our legal obligations in terms of communities of interest but they 've also reflected actual expressions of communities of interest by the communities themselves okay yeah just one to another so is there any debate and we just got discussed the how these the wards would fit in the options no no I want to get this resolution passed and then we will move to the options yeah I wanted to explain that if we don 't leave time for the debate on the options we will run out of time right is city be divided into the 16 wards name below it 's right in front of you it 's that big long piece of paper and it 's going to now include an explanatory note as to the mish block system okay is there any debate just just quickly Yanni no I just wanted to say that but we 've had a lot of lot of discussion and debate and the hearings into this a lot of community engagement I think we 've come up with which is with what I really fear compromise to adjust all the different competing demands so I 'm happy to support those recognizing that with ed those individual debates on the different aspects of the things that we wanted but I think this is a good solution to balance the competing needs of everything Express thank you Apple look um I realize this is that what 's it appears to be a compromise and this whole process I still believe that if we 're going out to bet for banks peninsula being an individual world that I think we should go out with that that had just over a hundred people where she come and submit on on this process I don 't think that 's enough I 'm really sorry but I 'm going to rule you out of order and I don 't and I mean this kindly because I don 't think that you realize that your breeching Standing Orders the resolution we 've already carried the resolution that we 're going out with 16 ward we 've already resolved that work that that we would come back today with the boundaries so this is really just about the boundaries that it 's that you can reduce the debate next week that you will have in public about why you don 't think we should be doing this that 's fine but this is given that we have decided as a council to go out with public notification on the 16 wards it 's just you know by majority by majority we 've made the decision to go out with the 16 wards these are the boundaries reflecting communities of interest or so so I really do think it 's a yes all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's Jamie and Paul No okay thank you and do we want to note that the population that each and so I 'll move that we note that the population that each member represent is as follows and Vicki will second dirt and i will put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried it 's just a noting provision it 's a noting provision we 're not agreeing to anything when we 're no that 's fine that 's fine it 's perfectly appropriate that you note it you 'd like to highlight it you just did right now we 'll move on to the options does anyone want to move one of the options option one seconded by tongue right is there any debate on that Paul F poor I just want I think that the double double peering awards into doubles where we can achieve the best result I would believe that the counselors for fennel t 'en and why Mary will be okay with it been three because wards and and what I just want to comment about the area I currently represent spam heathcott that which would now become sprayed in hallsville I think from what that 's what 's talisman yep what well I think it 's a good idea to in terms of the bit I think that is the best combination get in terms of the way the new wards would lie we the people from on the west side of Henderson 's road they told us very specifically they wanted to join hoon hay and sprayed him so clearly there are people in the hosel ward currently who who would see who traveled us that way who would see spreyton as being sort of part connected with where they love and the other thing too is I think it 's a really good pairing because this is an area of future building development there are are significant flooding and a lot of work that needs to be done so I think been ideal joining up of the two wards so all together i believe it 's braden and horse wall would be a sheet which we have I 'm David look I don 't have any extra grime with as far as representation because the pairings are the same vivid and coastal all the way through I just have one query over the peering of three wards will not appear in joining of three wards together does that effectively mean that the representation by Ward diminishes for each of those like for example up here with paired ward would probably have three councillors from each each for each community board where it for ward yeah so and under this system the representation for fen Dalton why Marion here would would be two members ward because I believe in correct me if I 'm wrong that over the city the same number of community board members must prevail so whilst I have an empathy of joining that up I feel that we will end up than unfair representation Ward for the community board and one that is now amalgamated with three counted joining up three so on that basis I would actually probably move in a an amendment to support the option to there numbers of elected members from each of the subdivisions and appointed members ease and the counselors that shows two per board regardless of whether you 're in a to ward or a three ward but you 're still no I 'm not one hundred percent sure but I was under the understanding that no matter what what community board you have in the city they have to have the same number eft each sub district and we discussed this last week each sub district within award has to have equal representation but they don 't have to be equal as between each other it 's only what than them oh look okay with 34 he was in 24 why my tea is going to be well I 'd probably just want some clarification from the way I understood it the other day was that every community board in the city had to have the same number of persons honor and then eyes no he 's not in a night well no no that was the understanding i took from I 've advice that was given it might be because there bigger community board areas it 's the numbers of sub voting areas in each area that has to be behind if that 's the case I 'm happy the advice we were given the other day and I 'm sure Vicki 's going to agree with me is that the each community board regardless of whether they were two or three sub areas had to have the same numbers no you don 't have to across the city no I 'm seeing two and I seen Mary agreeing and I just want you saw wasn 't just our get some districts don 't actually even have community boards covering the whole district so may only have you know Wellington for example here 's I be some areas covered by community boards the tower area etc so they don 't actually have to be an even put up a resolution to decide how many community board members subset yeah but we need to need to vote on the groupings and then we sorry I didn 't have that third resolution in front of me so then we need to look at so I 'll speak to the groupings I 'm certainly happy with the first principle that we where possible put two words together rather than three in order to bring democracy as close to the people as possible which has been an overriding theme of certainly things I 've said in debate right the way through I believe that the pairings that we 've got here are appropriate i 'll speak in particular to the heath kashmir pairing which i think brings the port hills and its issues together so issues of rockfall and and just issues of that particular landscape and it also means when you look at those two wards with banks peninsula you 've got all of the port hills issues so rockfall issues summit road society all of those port hills issues together just between those two wider community boards the Pendleton winery harewood and under this model with the numbers coming at eight which we achieved by using the resource that was originally allocated in the proposals of the a Corot by River Community Board to create one additional community board in the city compared to be paired as three and i guess my thinking behind having that as the the three pairing is aligned with comments that the two current elected members for that area of the two counselors for that area have made around triple groupings and I looking at this compared to the other models that are in front of us I believe that this is the most workable in terms of grouping communities of interest and reflecting the areas where there were submissions relating to boundary issues between the two wards in each case so very happy to be putting option one forward so the other board members two plus one from each so 93 council 11 12 to 21 119 know you can too yes I know that 's what we just said we just see it it 's 22 it 's too regardless of where you 're from except I think there may be a review of banks mulund it 's too big means up too much one is one well it 's out a corolla thanks banks peninsula yes ya know the suggestion is to see your preferences I 'm in favor of option one and the key reason Heath get in Kashmir have some issues as I 'm my colleague pointed out with regards to the hills is also the hefty river I think it 's a good pairing I mean I 've been working with counselor chin with regards to the Western I with small and residents group and some issues over there I mean this that type of work won 't change so I am comfortable option one and I was supported on it we can 't thank you I 'm Jimmy okay thank you the because the I suppose it is the 16 small war how able regarding the boundary I would like to go to option three because the each the community pool I have a different kind of a community connection and also have a different community of interest and my understanding you know regarding to the boundary of a community board for each one then the trough one is the follow currently for instance like the house where home be in the victim as the you know the three small world are all based on these of material to like to make the deputation I heard from the community pool no especial victim will commit ball and also from the host web resident Association it will change the palm tree no but they have no any idea southern energy I can accept and also regarding to the hosts were there particular mention that actually is the kind of house where has had a tangle with the excellent arkham importance though his support for many years it spatially back to her hatred Papa rural Council counted already in the victim women so I 'm not against us some other the you know the world how to two or three parted regarding to a victim week when written haunted house where there is a part of the together for for many many years is difficult to divide it so this wider I prefer the options to you know i 'm i 'm just going to suggest another way of handling us the the court decision was to get the the ward sorted which is what we refer to today this is also was talking sort of offline with Mary up here I feel like I 'm I 'm not even going to vote on this i 'm going to abstain because as the mirror I don 't sit on a community board I don 't have the sense of connection with the with the communities of interest and how they come together at the community board level and many respects you guys are the experts on the subject matter whereas i 'm actually not i 'm a generalist I look across the city as a whole so I 'm actually wondering whether it wouldn 't be a good idea that we actually refer this matter well we actually I haven 't heard anyone supporting option to you prefer option two okay well we would refer all three options to the council meeting that will formally decide the notification on Tuesday and in the meantime we can look at the the three options and I wouldn 't even necessarily entirely rule out if people were able to resolve amongst themselves you know that that there might be another option that is a better result on the numbers of it has that been distributed as well will distribute the options around the numbers as well because I think that will help clarify some issues but it will also probably spark some amendments around the numbers because we do end up with rather too many representatives on the banks peninsula with the proposal that we have in front of us so and as I sound I really want to kind of I mean I 'm not I 'm not washing my hands of it I 'm just saying that I don 't have that I have an overarching role for the city not an individual community board by community board role so David did you just feels like the query and part of our deliberations do we do we have to decide whether we elect community board members by division or by grouping we already made that decision so the only decisions we need to make now are the groupings for community boards and the number of members both elected and appointed that are made to each one of them that 's all we have to but if I just encourage counselors to talk amongst themselves to work with Jenny because that that process worked very well for the original decision and I think just whether I mean there is a good well round the table people want to achieve groupings of hearing groupings of communities of interest that 's all I 'm hearing I 'm not hearing any anything self-serving I 'm not hearing anything of self-interest I 'm hearing about communities of interest that have traditionally been grouped together and want to remain together so I think that we just need to work it through I don 't think we should feel compelled to accept the 8th Ward number I think we could look at seven and we could look at nine so I just think that we we 're opening it to a conversation about what would produce the best result given the wards that we 've now agreed to notify Jamie yani Phil I five use a reasonably well known around Allah but however I don 't know if you 're going to get absolute agreement on the sly almost wonder I look I would like to I mature I 'd like to foreshadow there so I don 't know in fact I won 't force you to it I 'm going to move I 'm in a move because we 've got nothing to debate at the moment I 'm going to move the Hearing Panel refer the matter of community board structure to the council for a formal decision next Tuesday thank you felt is there any discussion Yanni just um when it comes back just I think it 's really important that we do get some quite clear information so you know if you take option to my under steering is central if they were their own community board they would have four members for 20,000 people so they get one community will move over 5,000 whereas all the others would happen can I just can I just through can I just say that have that conversation have that discussion we will come back and debate that on Tuesday lien I agree with this process I 'm sporting a second and I just want clarification to though about process this is something that we as councillors should discuss among ourselves as representative the community too I just want to check I 'm aware though that in fact we are like a hearing this panel and I just want to check on the process regarding submitters and on say clearly and we know some already seen wanting to contact us I just want to check about the process around there this is the hearings panel was deciding not to make the decision we are referring the final we 're referring the decision on this matter to the council that 's right and I 'm assuming the into that at the stage though we 've heard from submitted yeah and in fact when attempts are made and to be blunt to lobby us that in fact we need to put aside that we need need to take into consideration what submitters have already told us but I just want my one who does staff well except that you won 't be making the decision as hearings panel panel will finish today they 're going into the hearings panel and so it so all decisions now your maid will be referred to counsel yeah that clarifies it thank you so all of people can 't make deputation no no thank you can 't make deputations to the meeting itself but I look you know we 're not absent connections with the community but I think that I 've absenting myself from the vote so no point lobbying me so but I think it is appropriate that I don 't vote because it you know in many respects how the community board groupings come together my real interest is that the community communities of interest are well represented around this table that 's my responsibility I think that if the elected board members in terms of what 's going out into the public for for now reference to the local government Commission because that will be the next step after the decision that we make on Tuesday I think that is appropriate that you bring your combined wisdom to the table we will find a solution there will be a good grouping that will work and you know if we can get consensus that will be fine so that 's that 's really that so i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried can I again formerly thank all of the staff for the work that they 've put on to bring us to this point I know that it has been extremely challenging I really like the the new process by starting by going out on having a very low key but very far-reaching conversation with a wide range of people that wouldn 't necessarily make submissions on things like representation reviews I think there were over three and a half and people connected with them that way which you know may not sound like a lot in terms of the numbers of the population of Christchurch but actually in terms of receiving submissions on on matters it 's actually a very good reach and I 'd like to formally think Jana Johansson 24 cheering the subcommittee that was putting the put the representation review together and and his team of people around him as well so thank you all very much thank you _"

    "text": "what we 're going to try and do is actually just get a single resolution that that captures the resolution that we 're going to make I 've also talked to Mary about the actual community board you know the the boundaries and the and the the grouping of the of the wards themselves with about two or three wards to make up a community board area and and because there is still just a little bit more work to be done about how we best get those communities of interest combined for the community board areas I 'm going to propose that once we 've resolved all of the other matters we will then adjourn this meeting to a time to be chosen on Thursday as part of the council meeting where we will confirm it that means that because we have to have to clear days for the for the meeting on Tuesday the following Tuesday to confirm our final position the all of the original decisions and the paper and everything will go online on the Wednesday night as pure the the requirements of the Act but bio bio closer play and in that way what that way we 'll be able to will be able to use that time to actually just sign off on the final detail because it is difficult just getting the different wards to combine in a way that meets our our requirement so if people are quite comfortable with that I think that 's probably the best way of handling it so we 'll we 'll adjourn the council meeting and re-establish that this meeting at some point during the council meeting just to confirm those those those final boundaries and to confirm the the groupings of the of the different Ward 's to make up the community board areas all right right so let 's have a look at the resolution the next resolution so if we could have someone who will move that after considering submissions council confirms its initial proposal that for the 2016 local authority elections the Christchurch City Council shall comprise 16 wards and reject the submissions for more or fewer Ward 's with someone like to move that Vicky second term is there any discussion a whole lot but I 'm just gonna justified my vote around us I 'll be voting against it well rejecting the proposes around this just because I don 't believe that what we 're coming up with now is fit for purpose just based on the submissions that I 've heard so I 'm agreeing to bits afterwards is just muddling around the edges in my view so for that reason I just think that this but beyond repair so i 'll be voting against umm ali i just wanted to reiterate my comments that I made before under Ward numbers particularly the comments made around small awards mean easier access to councillors and better representation I mean that assumes the number of issues are manageable that there are support systems in place which I 've already mentioned it also assumes the counselor is available in their 24 7 365 days of the year and so I won 't be supporting these smaller Ward sizes ok when we 're voting there in fact issues like issues in relation to the organization and it is a support that that in not not countered at all by the by the Commission so we have to be clear on that when we 're voting yanny yeah just quickly um I think the wards number is really a product of a number of councillors so I personally don 't see that having voted for the 16 counselors you know my preference was for a greater number of councillors to balance the deviation of definitely and and have it in and have maybe 17 in the in the city but given that we 've already made the decision about the number of councillors I don 't think it 's actually productive to increase there 's no actually way to increase in the reports even if you wanted to do that yeah yeah she can 't now because so I 'll vote for retaining the 16 Ward 's rather than mending it not not because I necessary agree with it just because basically logically given we 've already had to bite on the number of councillors I think this is the most sensible approach all right oh um okay well if we could have the considering submissions council confirms its initial proposal that for the 2016 local authority elections the Christchurch City Council shall comprise 16 wards and reject the submissions for four more or fewer wards I actually totally agree with what yani just see he 's absolutely right we 're voted for 16 councillors it seems to me that you can 't vote for fewer or more awards at this stage without disrupting the decision that 's already been made so it 's yeah yeah he 's all voting night ya know is that after we 're rejecting submissions for more or fewer awards than the 16 yeah so we 're confirming our original proposal that there be 16 Ward 's we 've already voted to have 16 councillors and we 've voted to have one counselor ward I can 't see any other solution but you know yeah but yeah on Thursday will be will be fine well on tuesday next week we 'll be fine because we 'll have one resolution that will be put to the meeting and that will be up yeah all right here we got an answer these the next one is H this is a much better way of doing it and the council agreed that the map tabled at the hearings on November 99 November shows the final arrangements for ward boundaries to include well I thought we were going to oh I see right the council agreed that the map table of the hearings meeting on november nine shows the final arrangements for ward boundaries to be included on the council 's final proposal with the provision for small adjustments to be made to specific niche block numbers to comply worse that should say comply with the local electro act section 19 v to further that the final proposal will be contained in the report presented at the council decision meeting scheduled for 17 november 2015 but the and that allows for but for some sort of specific tweaking at the boundary at the boundaries so is there any someone move that phil will move there and it 's thickened up by Paul Lane is there any discussion I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no oh carried and so the next one is the canoes the community ball clusters which I 'm proposing that we deal with on Thursday what pages it 38 okay so yeah so um yeah I just we kind of see me discussed as a secret community board for central but was the different boundary I 'd would no longer really support that now I think it would be joined up with some lynnwood yeah well there are four options here and there were three options in front of you and we 've we 've got another option as well which combines central with lund wood and I mean I 'm just I 'm just wondering whether can we do fear this one tool till Thursday yeah okay so Mary 's going to look at the other resolutions that we need to carry because I think that for Ford to member I mean yeah I mean because that the proposal was that as how many representatives from all we need to make the decision as to whether we vote for them at large or whether we vote for them and their individual three community board areas of that was decided do you have to peer grouping to pure Ward and the two ones do you have three per board and we 've got a proposal around the banks peninsula one as well so alone for example if banks peninsula is a separate Ward and then there are seven other wards that on that ratio three wards would still have to be combined so as to one community board yeah but that can be done with one combining findell shown here with McClain 's and it can be done with to having three so I mean there are different ways of doing it so I 'd much rather that we had the discussion on Thursday but but but that we got to a position where we were quite comfortable with what those groupings would look like for the community board areas I mean I don 't think we 're far off finding a solution to it I just don 't think that it 's probably i don 't i don 't know that these are all all the writer puts emails through some idea it 's just obvious got a couple of little tweaky oh yeah after some conversation the year and break yeah work what what 's your proposed a so what I 've got here is banks peninsula with before two subdivisions as we discussed the other day lynnwood central kashmir woolston sprayed in halls well riccarton hornby pendleton harewood McClane 's matelyn 's papanui and burwood coastal so that 's eight boards in total with just one of them with three and it links lynnwood with central because the central now coming further east and it keeps the port hills together with Kashmir and woolston which means all of those rockfall issues land movement issues port hills issues I kept together riccarton hornby having spoken to Jimmy I think that 's what he would agree with and Pauline certainly was in support of mushrooms papanui so that that 's where we 'd ended up after some discussions in the break so i can give that to Meereen yes sir good it 's like option for but it 's got if you look up there on the screen it just needs ship horn b2 riccarton and sprayed and two holes what was it yeah so it was banks peninsula lynnwood central yeah kashmir woolston yeah sprayed in halls well riccarton hornby wait wait wait sprayed on hols wall yeah riccarton horn during pendleton harewood McLain 's but that 's already there so you don 't write begin marshall ins papanui yep that 's fear and burwood coastal yeah that 's fear as well so check out horse warm be and yes said is that right Thanks furniture mum would central wolfson kashmir sprayed in halls will record on hornby burwood coastal helping a marshland Pendleton he would McLain 's yeah kindest and it seems really logical with the argument through guards to keeping the hills issues together but at the moment halls will and care if you want to use those words have corresponding issues with regards to Henderson space and that the flooding and mirrors absolutely fix both also the traffic issues with kiss me road across both awards etc so there is also an argument that so Paul 's will the Kashmir should be connected but um yeah it it up so on that basis could could were they happy with sprayer well could spray tanned take it could spray and take in Worcester woolston instead so in fact that last list you swap woolston from being combined with Kashmir and advice for yourself okay so you 'd have Kashmir will you do you know sorry catch me you can 't divide the the whole summer area from the Kashmir Hills I mean why would you do there they all go together I yeah but but but the other will be other oh you know some did or Cushman yes I remember the other option is it uh I thought the book was so good horse all really goes with record on hornby does the and restitution the residents of association meeting the other night they were very close to stay where they were yes they were they each made a point of ciphers which is probably gonna be more economical rather that 's part of our decision making yeah but we don 't_''_1102.07 I mean the this this is always the issue so what are the resolutions that we need to decide whether we agree that the community board members should be elected from I mean the banks peninsula one we know that 's the best resolution the four areas right so so the question is is that with the other ones if they are made of to do we have three from each Ward and if they are made of three do we have two from each ward yeah the number of community board members so that way there would be six community board members with each community board does anyone think that what they should be elected at-large across the community board if there 's three wards combined to make one community board then it 's two from each Ward as elected to the community board and if there 's two then there 's three from each Ward so there 's six six members of each community board all night would level you have to have the same number of community board members ward yeah that 's 6p ward oh so you have to yeah but your community board learn to people through that water where same number I got to have the same number 4 ward it just means that if you got a three tiered ward your lab nine yeah I mean to me I would have I would have central as a separate mandible yes according to Mary 's providing me with advice of my ear as we as you talk so she 's saying that the law requires it to be equal within the within that community board area that not between community must be taken at large point of view which I 'm completely fine with but that 's not a view that we 're taking within the broad area we 're going down to that that single point of the ward and saying the Lord has to be the representative point for councils and community boards you can 't have subjects with two and some were three well except that they sit on a community board that 's made up of doesn 't matter cuz you 're the repartee or you 're saying what I was saying if there are three then they should have nine members or you guys number of community board members ward orbit well then within the community forward boundary so only four divisions so its divisions within the community board so it is perfectly legitimate and legal for us to do that but council can make an alternative decision but what you 're ending up with here is one community board with 60,000 odd people and the rest of 40,000 so it doesn 't make any sense I mean the way around that is to have say what we 've got bangs peninsula on its own is to have saved central on its own as a community for ya and then have double ups the other ones otherwise it 's not gonna work I quite like the idea of having central on its own and then having to pee yeah that 's the only way would work otherwise it is then you get one was twenty two thousand and one more but banks penalties only got like sorry yes so each one earphone we need to accept these shoes on potential are quite different though I mean we had the rod Donald trust submission where banks peninsula and I think it needs to be understood that the work of the community board isn 't just about people it 's also about environment yet but it 's only for themselves it 's 42 they only get to determine that eschews it on the bank 's panchala it we 've already been through this and I mean this this was always going to be you know as I say it was the driver of the representation review changes we 've listened to the submissions and you know that the majority of us have decided that we will have a separate Ward for banks peninsula so how many community board members would be beyond that on one would talk to you because it would that would take us to the same argument potentially which we don 't think we could justify it no for 20,000 yeah we could we could sit for you know for what would be an appropriate number 44 listen you can 't go listen for so it seemed own luck that the central submitters we 're very keen on having their own community board that it 's going to go through a lot of very challenging issues over the next wee while and I suspect its numbers are going to throw everything out the next time that we do the representation review if we get our ambition of increased people living in the central city I think we 're going to end up having to move all the boundaries again anyway so can we do a model with central on its own mean and in how we would work the community boards with you want to go back to option option one is it so you currently don 't have a lot of population there yeah so you 'd have to have four so therefore you say it was 20,000 you 've got the community board member voting for for for 5,000 per one community board member this is the other Ward 's in the city having to so it 's almost double 10,000 so it does seem quite I mean we also heard that the people in New Brighton or and feel what wanted their own board as well and it didn 't we didn 't have any were three there was Nick 's near then just wanted more community board and it makes me cry yeah they also have made nine I mean the this is this is why I don 't want to have this debate now so because everyone 's everyone 's going to have a different view of what what works and the proposal was put up that way that we look at whether this option would work so and maybe I should have just said no I 'll stick to what I was gonna do anyway okay night today all right so here 's his one recommendation that after considering submissions the council agrees to amend initial the initial proposal to form a single community board for banks peninsula yes so so can I put that out no can someone move that Phil Andruw yeah okay that after considering submissions the council so move the East from Council and put it at the end of submissions yes time yeah right so i will put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no oh ok separate community boards on the peninsula right not a single community oh no no let 's just hit the phone okay so um did after considering submissions the council agrees to amend the initial proposal to form a single community board for banks for Angela currently has two we 're proposing it has one Jimmy have you posted David yeah right so that 's carried and the second one is that after considering submissions council confirms its initial proposal that for the 2016 local authority elections community board members so take off the S will be elected by the electors of subdivisions shall we put comprised of wards which will mirror the ward boundaries no no it 's only communities community boards ahead subdivisions yeah will be elected by the electors of subcommittee subdivisions put put in brackets which will be consistent consistent with ward boundaries if you 've got a community board that has three okay okay delete it delete it they 'll only imagery yeah well no actually we don 't need to write an awards because we 're saying what the sub that they 're going to a whole would someone like to move that because we can deal with thanks for lunch or secretly Andrew seconded Phil can you put up there yeah yeah okay so so if we 've got we 're going to come we 're going to consider we 're going to confirm our initial proposal that for that for the next election will do this right so those in favor Marquess those opposed mark know and that 's carried so the next it 's just since you 've made the decision of our banks financial award you actually have to note that it 's not within the clear representation in it and this is just explaining why you 've made that decision but that 's not a motion that 's that the council nodes so in fact we 're clear on so so the motion yeah I 'll put no no just go noting that noting that and then delete up to that just delete the next three words yet noting it and then put a comma at the end and go Council so take out the word bet just take out council considers that warrants being considered as council considers that the banks for warrants warrants being considered yet yeah as an isolated community under Section dollar for the following reason support and smashing their net further to avoid yep okay so so these are all the reasons that go on the submission to the local government Commission and to support the decision that we 've made can you put the put a capital letter on Hills down the bottom here report Hills yep and just go up again yeah yeah yeah yeah all right so can you put up a voting oh sorry Andrew can move that fell sick and it so if you can put up this this is the justification for the bank 's financial award decision that we 've already taken three more pending yeah we 've already made the decision to hear banks furniture separate this is why this is them yeah that 's it everyone very good with many thing that we want you 've mess she remains fold it so we when we come back when you talk to jeanne this week can you message that came through the submissions and I just want people to take this on board was that they were looking for names that didn 't exclude parts of the ward so by including only one part of the ward that it didn 't really speak to the to the whole area it wasn 't an inclusive name so the names that people really liked was central and coastal and the reason they like them was because they were they were not that they were they weren 't exclusive they were very inclusive names and very descriptive so if you could give some thought to that thanks lunch is fine oh yeah yeah that 's right eg fast fast forward the fast forward Ward the yeah greenfields ward yeah I mean seriously just just give some thought to even even some more generic names for bigger groupings of areas would be quite good some hottie no right to okay so there 's there 's a there 's a k resolution defer there was a rip there was a submission asking us to defer the representation review which is it was we cannot do that and we have highlighted the fact that the status quo would not provide fair representation for residents and these high growth areas like halls walls so that although although you know as you know I 've got some sympathy for this it 's not something that we can legally do so would someone like to move that we reject this submission reject them both yani seeking to tim i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's kept it Jamie Jamie opposed right are there anything is there anything else no and are there any of these that we we 've done the hall okay all right so um I I 'll now adjourn this meeting until thursday at time to be notified do I have to add in it to a particular time I do why don 't I I 'm not going to make it no I 've got a I may not be back by then ok I 'll a genital oh well known and in there might be something happening on thursday something good what entire dinner til 830 on Thursday morning and we 'll do it straight up before the council meeting starts yeah yep okay I genital 830 and it should only take half an hour because then I can tell the community board members to meet us at nine o 'clock if that 's all right so it 's a June til 830 on Thursday thank you very much and thanks very much for I think been it 's been a good quality debate and you know it 's hugely challenging during a representation review with everything else on our plates but I think everyone 's participated really well and I 'm I 'm very grateful for the XO thank you very much and I 'll see you all before but i 'll see you on thursday for this continuation _"

    "text": "thank everyone thank you very much and declare the meeting open and today we have the initial proposal sorry the consideration of the post hearings panel consideration of the representation review I don 't believe there are any apologies today so we 'll move on to the next item on the agenda and these these are the formal these are the formal deliberations so we 're not going to move on to them so everyone has been circulated a copy of the sand version of it is up on the on the on the board there and so what we 're going to do is that as you can see here that the headline says manor shoes written submission number members which raise this issue additional issues staff comment hearing panel decision and the hearing panel reasoning now the reason that we 're doing this is because we 're following a specific process that is laid out for us and the local lateral act that right like will it to it and the council 's final proposal must be based on submissions or else the initial proposal needs to be means as we go through each element if we are going to make changes from the initial proposal that needs to be based on submissions otherwise the community has not had an opportunity to give feedback on the proposal and community members have grounds to submit appeals and or objections councils public notice of its final proposal under section 19 into is required to state the reasons for amendments and the reasons for any rejection of submissions which is why this is formatted and the particular way there for the reasons must be recorded in the local authorities resolution of its final proposal council must consider the following issues in particular and to record detailed reasoning for all related decisions these will be the formal decisions that we make at the end identification of communities of interest the basis of election establishment or retention of community boards specifying the ratio of population to propose members for each proposed Ward constituency or subdivision and the reasons for those proposals in terms of section 19 b 2 and if applicable section 19 b 3 and consideration by territorial authorities of ward boundaries submission on the council 's an initial proposal may lodge an appeal against the council 's decision an appeal must relate to the matters raised and that person submission so that the range of people that can appeal as is established by those who made submissions this document goes through each one of those and identifies those that supported or did not support or proposed different components of the consideration that will be going through today and I thought it might be just quite useful again to remind people exactly the considerations that we have the purpose of local government just to remind us why we 're all here to enable democratic local decision-making and action by and on behalf of communities and to promote the social economic environmental and cultural well-being of communities and the present and for the future section I 'm sorry I 'm just moving on to the so I printed this off the local government Commission website the the key factors and considering effect that with the key fit and reviewing our representation arrangements we are required to provide for effective representation of communities of separate factors that need to be considered carefully communities of interest effective representation of communities of interest and fair representation of electors they are all interrelated with each other so what I 'm intending to do is as we work through this table that has been prepared for us and again thank you to the staff who put this table together because it does make our task much easier you 'll see that on each section there is a green headline and the green headline the first one is banks peninsula ward integrated into city ward or not that is the overarching issue but there are several sub decisions that were were several decisions that we need to make either to reject submissions or to amend the initial proposal and or whether to agree so so as we go through each of the individual ones what I 'm proposing is that we have an overarching debate so I 'm going to get a mover and a seconder for each of the recommendations that sit under the the decision one or so it 's the penultimate column and then I 'm seconder for each of them I 'm going to open up the issue for debate and so we will debate the particular issue that the green issue as it were and then i will put the individual submissions once the debate has concluded is that clear to everyone very good okay so could I have a mover and a seconder 4.1 that we reject the submissions which supported the initial proposal to integrate banks peninsula run to the banks peninsula summon award that 's moved by Andrew seconded by Phil Clearwater the second motion is to amend the initial proposal to change banks peninsula to current ward boundaries but someone like to move that it 's moved by Paul lonsdale seconded by Andrew tuna and I think that 's it for those 21 so now I will open up the the overarching issue where the bank 's financial award should be integrated into a city ward or not I 'll open that up for debate injury thank you we heard from a number of submitters from banks peninsula and in particular from the a Corot y real work parts of we saw photographs and we heard of all sorts of examples as to why the isolation experienced by particularly those on the other side of the hill top is very real we heard about weather events we heard about driving distances any number of issues that certainly speak to that community as an isolated community and that actually reflects the decision that was made previously by council as we put our initial proposal together we also heard from submitters closer to the sitting so submitters around lyttelton harbour and in particular submitters on the city side of the port hills so from heathcote from Mount Pleasant and from the Hagley ferry Mead community board among others that suggested that those communities didn 't have commonality didn 't have a community of interest with banks peninsula and in fact that those communities saw themselves as looking to each other looking to ferry Mead and looking down Ferry Road ascend chilean into woolston and the sitting the argument in many ways against the isolated community of banks peninsula is that little turn is separated only by the tunnel from christchurch and that be put that during weather events and in the earthquake and so on little Sam was in fact isolated from Christchurch the reality is that littleton is a lot closer to Christ Church as a community of interest and other parts of the peninsula like those in the a Corot a subdivision of the existing ward the reality though remains that the peninsula is one community of interest a Corolla and why Rua certainly do have a community of interest and are isolated as soon as you start to look at separating little turn off from the rest of the peninsula that 's where it starts to the argument starts to fall down because of course all of the communities around a corolla harbour and the outer bays and the southern bays are a community of interest all of the communities around lyttelton harbour are also a community of interest the idea of splitting littleton from diamondharbour which are connected by the ferry the inner harbor road that goes right around there there are any number of organizations that go right the way around lyttelton harbour and in fact go submissions from the rod donald trust and other organizations that are pan peninsula organizations so if we accept that a Corolla is a isolated community and we accept that the peninsula is a community of interest and then we start to take the view that lyttelton harbour is also a strong community of interest and that lyttelton harbour and a corolla harbor has such similarities and the peninsula in fact is is one entity as both a landform and a community of interest that certainly speaks to the arguments that have been put very strongly that banks peninsula is in fact one isolated community of interest we always expected people from the peninsula to say that but i think the resounding argument really comes from the fact that people that were proposed to be communities that were proposed to be urged with the peninsula were also saying the same thing that you know the communities of Mount Pleasant and Heath Kurt and so on essentially look into the city rather than out onto the peninsula so I think the arguments have been very well posed to support the peninsula keeping and one community of interest Yanni speak in regards to this issue and I think you know overwhelmingly what we heard from the peninsula is they like having their local representation and who can blame them why wouldn 't you want to keep what what you had and why wouldn 't you want to have a local councillor for your local area and in fact I thought it was really interesting when we heard from a number of them submitters that actually in my view they actually would have supported small awards in the urban area to counterbalance the population ratio that they had being retained so you know I think it 's important to look at this in the context of the number of councillors and the size of the urban Ward 's compared to the peninsula ward so you know I 'm happy to support this today going to the local government Commission I think we 've been told that this will be treated automatically as an appeal and therefore there we rights for others to come in and make submissions around that change in the population I around the population ratios for the urban wards and I didn 't hear from the peninsula that they supported bigger rewards for our initial proposal and order to keep their Peninsula Ward bend the status quo in fact I heard the opposite so we can have that debate as we move through this process but i just wanted to place on record that my understanding from the peninsula was they supported retaining the local banks financial award but it wasn 't_''_787.16 at the expense of increasing larger urban wards to higher population ratios than our initial proposal I should interrupt just one thing because said that its treated as an appeal it 's referred to the local government Commission so it 's not it 's not an appeal per se there may be people who appeal against the decision but but it is referred and they will consider it because it is outside the team percent yeah thank you elephant um our Phil but I certainly support the recommendations I think an Andrew traversed the up the arguments for banks peninsula remaining a separate ward but i think the when the amendment to the 2013 local it correct that in fact that now the doesn 't require theory present it doesn 't require fair representation the same way when it would prevent effective representation of isolated communities and I think that also refers ready two distinct communities of interest so I think that that 's quite a change in the thinking of the Commission and with that in mind I clearly I believe it should be a change in the thinking of this council there any other comments I 'll just make one comment what does that I think that the submissions that we heard we 're quite overwhelming and they weren 't just from the the sort of banks peninsula side of the hill they certainly were reflected on the Summoner side as well and I think that the the real issue here and i thought i would like to kind of be able to record this when we when we get in front of the local government commission is that their assent a provision really in legislation that allows specifically for the merger of a small council that of finding the right link point between them just really proved too difficult without putting this up as a proposal so I support the proposal I hope that their local government Commission will give us a little bit more time to think about how we provide for better integration across our city 's boundaries which are now beyond the the city boundary as it were and to the banks peninsula area yeah so I think that a little bit more work needs to be done nationally I think in terms of these integration issues because they will come up again there will be other mergers that occur around the country and I think it would be useful to have the local government Commission look at this very very specifically they looked at that last time they asked us to look at it again specifically around community of interest and I think that we have we 've done exactly what the local government Commission asked us to do what we proposed was the only thing we could have proposed and I think that now that we 've given this matter careful of the local government Commission so i 'll put the first of the resolutions now i think that they 'll be a division on on this so have we got that set up for that so if we could have the first resolution those in favor of the first resolution which is to reject the submissions if you 're in favor of rejecting the submissions that supported the initial proposal to under great banks peninsula and two banks plancha summon award then vote yes otherwise no yes it 's an isolated community correct yeah yeses for us isolated community and there is carried and the second resolution is amending the initial proposal to allow for banks peninsula to remain as a single ward so again well I just turned on the microphone which I didn 't instead of eats I turned on the microphone and it 's also carried thank you and the next item for debate of a number of councillors in the city which received a fair number of submissions and in focus and various groups you 'll move that who said that Pauline Pauline move that and was to amend the initial proposal of sixteen counselors in ER and amend the status quo so that 's so the recommendation is to reject the submissions to amend that proposal would someone like to move that we reject the amendments to the proposal Pauline sickened up by Ellie is there another one yeah and I means the initial proposal 16 would prefer status quo also someone move to reject that submission as well yani seconded by Andrew all right I 'll open up the debate on the number of councillors anyone like to debate that Jonnie um thank you um sorry I just I just wanted to repay I guess those earlier comments and regards to the peninsula that we 've made the decision to accept the submissions from the peninsula it 's my view that the feedback and desire from the city was for local and small award representation than the current status quo and if you think about the implications of the peninsula being separate what you fictive lee do is increase the population ratios and the urban wards so personally I actually think we need to actually add an additional urban ward to compensate for the peninsula having its separate one I think that enables us to have more effective and fair representation of those urban communities and what we heard we heard from people in the central city for example around possibly the desire to have a community board we heard from people in the coastal area that given the magnitude of the earthquake issues that they would like to be more represented as well so i think we heard a compelling case not just from the peninsula but from other communities in the city to have more local representation so I totally reject staying with the status quo I won 't speak to that amendment and that 's always happy to move it I think with our population growth remaining as we currently are there 's not an option and for interesting enough when you look at the population ratios actually they don 't actually change that much even with the addition of the proposed three councillors because of our population growth so it 's an interesting position to be in but a number actually didn 't quite specify the 16 what they said is they increase that they supported the move towards a higher number of councillors and smaller local wards so you could take them to be either 4-3 or 44 which other to the two main issues so depending on what way you read those submissions so I think people were pretty open to it and I think that the key thing is that they supported local representation and a small award basis so I vote against the the two first resolutions and thus and support the final one this is a 16-4 yeah there any pool I 'm gonna be voting against 16 council going for the status quo I mean what I heard from a number of the people that submitted as they were very happy with the representation this tomb and they will be very concerned if there was a change so on that basis i 'll be voting for 14 counselors will be or the 13 counselors in status quo I 'm Phil Andruw ali i 'm going to start recommendation the proposal 16 that we did the pre and the information we hear back from the pre engagement with a large number of people up to 3,000 was very clear that people wanted more contact with their cat with their local councillor also when we okay there was a relatively small number of submissions but the large majority of those submissions that came in wanted an increase in the number of councillors were certainly more than the status quo and i think also that given the situation that christ church is in in terms of us you know five years down from the biggest earthquake this country 's ever heared still and half the city in many ways still recovering and also us wanting to regenerate the city it 's essential that we have the firing power at the count table so I 'm sincerely supporting the 16 um Andrew I 'm also happy to support the 16 I think 16 counselors counselors will respond to what we heard through the initial round of public engagement and through the submissions in as much as it will allow for a better level of local representation it 'll more local and small Awards possibly a better definition of community event communities of interest and more effective and more fair representation I also note the number of submitters that supported 16 also stated that they possibly would have liked more than 16 councillors that 's essentially where I 'm coming from I would have liked to have seen more than 16 but given that this is where we 've got to and we 've got mapping that supports 16 and that 16 achieves a number of the objectives that have been supported in the engagement and through the submissions and yes ideally I 'd like more than 16 what 's in front of me today is a recommendation for 16 and I would my urge my colleagues to support the 16 in as much as it delivers those objectives I 'll be in favor of this today Ellie and then David thank you i think there are many assumptions made in the suggestion that more counselors means better representation I don 't think that 's necessarily true I think that we need better support as counselors in order to support the current councillors and that will enable us to work more effectively and improve that representation so I do not support the idea that just increasing the number of councillors will increase the level of representation David thin Jamie thank you look I 'm going to support the status quo I would have originally supported a move to one more councillor the feedback that I have in the community is that we are having good representation from our counselors at the moment and I think given the situation that our city 's been in and in the last five years we have arguably gone through the toughest part of our council with with a 13 counselors there will be an added cost to increasing the number of councillors in our city and I think that it doesn 't send a great message to increase the number of councillors and I 'd rather see an increase in the redevelopment of the city rather than spending money on increased numbers of councillors Jamie then Flynn yep I 'll agree with the last speaker there so I I disagree that an increase number of the submitters that are listed here they haven 't necessarily said that they love the idea of 16 councillors it 's what they 've said is look if with in a lot of instances I can recognize the names and recall the submissions where they 've said look if you are going to go down this path well we may not necessarily agree with it here are some of the smaller aspects that could be refined within this model so the reality with these hearings is that it 's not a first-past-the-post system it 's not the amount of people with a shoulder tap that come along and say what you agree with you 've got to sit down here and use your noggin and and digest wat what the submitters have said and you weigh that up and there 'll be pros and cons for everything but it 's our job is elected members to to wait what is being said by these submitters and I think what 's really clear to me is that um welshed the pre engagement may not always be necessary scientific and always the pivot system and always isn 't scientific and I agree that when you 've got 80-plus percent of people saying in the press survey that they don 't want more counselors that also isn 't the most scientific way of going about things I accept that but the conversations that I 've had with people around this the ones that I find most compelling other than Zach feat wat LEC at nets more isn 't necessary better quality over quantity as sometimes theatre option I think that in my view and from the submissions that we 've heard reading between the lines the thrust of it was that people want effective and efficient councils and I don 't see people banging down the door was at the council chambers to say that they 're not well represented I 've heard a lot of people say they feel very adequately represented I think following on from that most important thing is from time to time residents will have a local issue which crops up and it rattles them and when that happens or if that happens and for most way to engage in the local democratic process and I believe they have that now so I think we run the risk of your being you know the the committee that 's charged with creating a horse and you end up with a camel by making change for changes sake that doesn 't necessarily serve that purpose I hear arguments for local decision-making and I think that there is a fair argument but we 're having the wrong conversation with it under a counselor banner because I think that grassroots local decision-making is better placed at the community board level whereas the council table we 're talking about what 's the capital release program going to look like what are you going to do with the town hood where do you put in an L tb-p our contribution to a stadium and the like in that local decision-making at a grassroots level well laid back there may feel that it 's important for residents to be close to it that 's what your community boards are there for so I think that we run the risk of going down a with adding more counselors Weiner we 've got information we 're basing this on from 2013 census of which I know I 've moved twice something and a number of other people are we 've gone through so much we 're doing district plan review regenerate Christ ginger development Christchurch capital release program goodness like hunt room I can 't think of all the pressing issues that we 've got on our plate right now that no other council throughout the country has got and I think when you 've got a new census being come next year and a new council coming in next year that would actually be quite a sensible place to do that and also before then we need to sort out the delegations for community boards and that 's the place of the local decision-making so the greatest weight that I gave to submissions was the one to say it isn 't really that broken there 's probably a more appropriate time to do it so I be rejecting the proposal to increase to 16 councils because i don 't think that meter is necessary going to come back to i 'm gonna support the proposal and i 'm going to come back to answering the question what are their our task which is to determine fair and effective representation my viewers that through 16 along with the next recommendation over the wards they treat it separately but they go together that we will achieve that will achieve a more effective ratio by having a lower ratio of counselors to wards we have geographical constituencies identified in these recommendations but we also have social constituencies within and across these geographic boundaries this will enable our lower socioeconomic areas in my view to have greater representation which is what tends to happen when you have smaller areas they have a greater chance of being represented so I said this is to be treated separately from the next recommendation but in fact that both do go together in terms of answering that question of creating a more a fairer and a more effective representation Jimmy okay thank you yeah i think that are the consultation is so practical evidence as where we were be important you will committal member fully support you know the lambo of counselors increased from curve under 13 to the 60 members also quite a few la our resident association i also fully supported this recommendation also you will review and the current even the democratic all the population increases for moment is not of the the and of the workers you know people in France to the white church and also the this the trend will continue new growth it 's roughly a moment a popular year at least 3,000 people no networks the population were in a cottage for the kind of risk contraction or region generation etc and also lost a favor kinda along process of the pre consultation and the established is a drafter the proposal to kind of 16 cancerous and also the we consider the fair representation effectively potential and community the of increased a siege are all you know is kind of 1600 a cancellation most of the kind of a standard resolution so I supported the draft proposal the future councillors the 16 cancer thank you cooling thank you I think that the system is changes we 've seen in Christchurch so we do have to do this right now and it doesn 't stop us from looking at a geared again and three years in an actual fact we 're obliged to do it every six years so and at the risk of thinking that the city 's only the size of a runner park we 've got more things to do than then create camels and yes councillors do need to be up at a strategic level and have a helicopter view but we also need to be really in touch with our communities and it 's what people want so to have more counselors is obviously going to enable that so that 's why I 'm supporting it and also the reduction of the geographical area will help people to know their counselor and vice versa so it would also bring us closer to the national average of representation of which christ church right now is way out of kilter we 're sitting around one in twenty-seven twenty-eight thousand people per counts this will bring us down to round about 22,000 23,000 the national average so I will be supporting an increased number of councillors for those reasons thank you um look I I I just do want to respond to one of the submissions that we receive which was you know very much to do to keep what we had and not have to go through this process now because of all of the reasons that have been outlined in the debate we don 't have that as an option legally we don 't the local government actors at Pauline Coty 's just highlighted the local electric says that we have to go undergo this process every six years so we haven 't undergone this process so we have to under God the last time 2009 the local government Commission gave us a very clear steer around banks peninsula so that 's really been the driver of the proposal now that we 've looked at the proposal again and given careful consideration to all the submissions that we received and made the decision around banks peninsula at the end of the day the 16 counselors for me works the beast and 's exactly the number that was highlighted or that we arrived at when that proposal went forward and the reason that the local government Commission did what it did and that at that time was that the council was completely divided about the nature of the changes that were introduced because they were significantly different wards and it actually looked a lot easier just to jam two of them together then it was to completely redo it and I think what we 've done this time as we 've got to 16 councillors and we haven 't just redone them completely they 've got enough linkages to the previous Ward 's for people to see that they belong and and the in the right Ward further for the council position so I I really do think that we 've got to a good good place on this but what I 'm going to do is to reverse the order of the decision-making just so that we get to the initial proposal at the at the conclusion because if one of the other options succeeds or or that we don 't would revert to the we would revert to the initial proposal if we couldn 't get decision otherwise so I 'm not putting that very well but we 'll start with the resolution to amend the initial proposal of 16 counselors to the status quo which has 13 counselors and that has been moved and seconded so I will not know actually it 's been moved and seconded that we reject us so for people who support the current number of councillors over any of the other suggestions then you need to vote against this so no as it 's counterintuitive because of the recommendations being to reduce so if you support 13 councillors then as opposed to the 16 that have been recommended then you must vote no and for those of us who want to reject the submission then we vote yes right so if you support the 16 both yes so that is carried and so that submission is rejected and we move to the initial proposal so we 're rejecting we 're proposing to reject the submission except I think counselor Johansson may have misunderstood what amend the proposal for more counselors oh no no it was no no that 's the correct one yea yea sorry I 'm which one of my sorry it 's it 's this one here sorry because I hit it on front of me can we love to that this one 's this one 's the this is to reject the proposal yeah that 's right so for those that want more than 16 councillors to be the final proposal then yeahh two more than 16 count that 's correct that 's why I was getting confused then so again for those that believe that we should have more than 16 counselors that with that should be our final proposal then you would vote no if you support 16 councillors then vote yes this hey this is voting to reject the submission you don 't want more than 16 so vote yes yep so this is this is this is to reject the submission the the recommendation is to reject the submission the submission proposed that there be more than 16 counselors so it is no I was just making you if you are happy with 16 or don 't want more than vote yes yeah that although we are going to have to look actually can we can we can we change the resolution so it says reject the submission to amend the proposal to no no no more than 16 counselors and then we need to have another recommendation because yeah whit we 've got WIC okay well okay well let 's let 's go up and it 's photon these 16 can we vote on the 16 first because if that is carried which I 'm assuming it will be then we can actually work out the detailed resolutions that we need to flow on from there so those who are in favor of retaining the initial proposal the initial proposal of 16 councillors becomes the council 's final proposal vote YES or if you are posed to that vote no this is just straight the 16 what we 're saying is I 'm just saying agree to retain the initial proposal that the initial proposal of 16 Council has become the council 's final proposal so there particular recommendations amendment we 're going to put the second amendment now yeah I want to show that I supported that so because you 've done it for run the other way now my voting record doesn 't issue make any sense yeah that 's okay so redic the submission to amend the proposal to more than 16 counselors so if we could put that resolution so people who want who wanted to show their support for more than 16 counselors can you vote what 's Noah 's laps no because if you vote if you vote no then you are supporting more than 16 counselors right this is about rejecting the submission sorry look I did say at the beginning that these are technical detailed resolutions that we have to carry or lose so the simply says reject the submission to amend the proposal to more than 16 counselors if you want more than 16 counselors as carried right yeah okay and now we 've got because some of the submissions actually suggested we amend the proposal for fewer not make a great erect fewer than 16 counselors would someone move that we reject the submission to amend the proposal for fewer than 16 counselors what 's actually fewer than 14 that 's not status quo it 's the proposal oh right i mean the proposal for fewer and fewer than the proposal that 's right so that 's moved by phil seconded by pauline hey that 's right fewer fewer counselors if you want fewer don 't know if you want lease gone do some grimmer training if you want great Yeah Yeah right let 's carry so that that 's all sorted right so now we move on to number of councillors to ward so this is the issue about election at large across community board areas election by Ward and the first motion is that the initial proposal of single-member Ward 's be confirmed as the council 's final proposal Pauline will move there sikander by Andrew the next one is that is that we agree that the initial proposal of 16 councillors elected from each single Ward be confirmed as the council 's final proposal so basically this one is is basically saying that to being elected at-large so we won 't have 16 elected at large but from individual Ward so who would move that term will move that seeking to buy clean and the next one is what what is the submission saying oh this is this is supporting a lecture at large will help but why we got two separate resolutions when they were set their opposite counselor should be elected by Ward constituency not at large it 's really support election at large that 's one it 's you 're either for against yeah okay all right so and then so will someone move that we we don 't support election at large which is the opposite of what we just yeah Phil end David it means just across the whole thing the whole cans the holes in the D ounces are elected like the mere yes yes not as joined up some of the classmate the next one is multi-member wards so would someone like to move that we reject multi-member wards because there will be I know that it 's going to be a debater baiting issue because up by Pauline yeah but there 's really just we 'll just have a have a single debate because that the issues the issues for debate whether we I mean I just think that the issue that members will want to debate because having discussed these issues it 's clear that some members believe that there should be the joining of wards to make multi-member or to member to member wards so that would be something that could be dealt with in the multi-member would component of this I think we I think we were quite clear and this and if somebody wants to anyway but you can debate the issue of whether election as at-large across community board areas or election by single ward so I 'll just open that up for debate no debate Jamie yeah so I 'm just getting my head around that 's exactly just with the double negatives and everything through it you just need to take a pause for a moment um I think they always saying here all there was sponding to each of the submission so that 's why there 's 's three things touched on really election of counselors across the board at large just either mere single-member Ward 's or one counselor subdivision forward the third one being really those subdivisions which had joined up as proposed would elect their counselors across those rewards so the first one at large no I don 't think that 's workable you can 't you this is representation effective efficient fair representation all that sort of stuff I think that you had there 's some sense if you wanted to be a Board of Governors or a board of directors then usually six councillors it at large and they could just get on with it probably really effective really efficient not great representation that 's exactly what I see it no no so that it wouldn 't work so no I 'm not going to support that but then on the flip side I think then elect in one counselor subdivision don 't support either so that 's why actually like in the middle I found most compelling submissions were the ones in the middle that said that joined up subdivisions that all throughout their ward as a whole which is effectively the status quo it so I 'll speak to that really now why I like that is that there is a different oath that you take is a community board member and as a counselor and and as a counselor you need to be really looking with a city centric view that if there 's perhaps a proposal for something that 's going to benefit your ward you need to be making sure that you 're taken that christ church inc approach and saying yep i know i 'm elected sort of by this area but for the greater good of christchurch this is probably a good way to go there was an interesting submission which I hadn 't thought of this prior to us going to the earrings process but I think we got actually had a PhD and he was saying that what he thought would happen is that if you had a counselor that was elected per sub division one member in one member alone that even if you do join up like as being proposed those accountable and a true sense to those other areas and that effectively you get this pity parochialism for that area where they will inherently try to support that small patch within that their ward because the other ones don 't elect them they 're not on their voting paper and I think that ultimately when people want to contact their elected representative they want to contact someone was on the voting paper and to have multi members there or what I think makes sense you can share the load a bit you and you can also differentiate the difference between a community board member and a city councilor and I think that it gives you the ability to to really say at a community board meeting with the two or three joined up subdivision community boards the counselors to take holistic view and to try and bring that City Council perspective there to say hang on but take a big picture view with this and this and they are elected elected by that greater area on the on the ballot papers anyway so I think that that is it 's 't work sure it gives that big city perspective but I think it does lose their representation at a local level and I think that elite but on the flip side I think that are leaking that counselor from the subdivision and subdivision alone means you have one counselor that is effectively there is a super community board member falling into the trap of really banging on for the little subdivision at a council level and I think that is a recipe for disaster and it was alluded to a number of times throughout the submissions process I think it makes a lot of sense the local government Commission generally is against that and I think they are against it for good reason and that having that distinction between a community board member owner counselor is actually good governance that you can have those counselors there that look after that Ward which gives that local and put that local representation but also gives the benefit of having that holistic view to join the subdivision community board members to take that that that Ward approach so I think it 's the 's away then then the person that can pick up a slack as just as accountable as the next person so I think that makes a lot of sense and I think there were some really good submissions a lot along those lines and and hence why I will be supporting well double negative I 'll be rejecting the proposed rejection if it makes any sense all right I 'm Ellie and then Johnny I just like to lose a lot of urgency I don 't the at-large across the city I think councillors need to know your immediate neighborhoods I certainly don 't support the single member wards and I for the reasons that Jamie is also mentioned there are many problems and in some wards there 's a real concentration of those problems and surely papanui particularly you 've got issues around transport that are different to problems and other parts of the city you 've got the street workers issue you 've got the flooding issue there are problems and issues in the ward that are very specific to Shirley papanui and having two members elected members problem that 's shared we have different experience we have different political takes on things as well and it 's the ability to be able to bounce those ideas off someone that is at the same level of responsibility and accountability as Jamie said that is really really important and if you want to be mundane about it yes if one of us falls over there is someone else there if you do need to go on holiday and you do you 've got someone else there so I strongly support retaining the double member wards and won 't support the single member awards for the reasons that both Jamie and I 've just mentioned yani thank you I support the idea of having local awards and single-member wards I think actually that i was on a community board when you had the two different wards that joined together and actually i thought it worked okay it seemed to work quite well actually so that you didn 't seem to get the parochialism so you had two counselors from each Ward joining together but it wasn 't engaged with a they were on the community board came together and and work through the issues relevant to that wall so my experience has been positive so I think you can combine two different Ward 's to form a community board out that issues that have been raised I like the idea of local wards because I think it actually increases local accountability and I think it 's really interesting i remember when i went and did the the scope one exhibition many years ago I drove around where every council a lot and it 's really interesting to think about where councillors love in relation to a city being represented and I think it 's really important to have local diversity amongst counselors on this council representing the entire city and the issue if you combine the wards that we have as you get areas with high voter turnout next to areas of low voter tenor and in many ways the same arguments that the people on the peninsula pot for not joining in with the urban world they didn 't want the people in sumner determining who their representative was the urban area and that you know take the Hagley pyramid wall at the moment very midst got sixty five percent voted Turner the heavy side has got thirty-five percent voter turnout so it doesn 't it doesn 't take a rocket scientist to figure out where the votes and that Ward how they actually determine who represents them so I think it 's really important that we do go back to a system of smaller wards and I support single single member wards I also think it increases the accountability of that counselor to be involved and to attend I think it means that they have a much more local connection to the local community then they otherwise may get with worth having to so very supportive of I 've going to this issue that story to this to a system um andrew has been elected at-large across the city and I equally don 't support any option of multi-member wards so I do support the single member wards for similar reasons to the fact that i support an increase in the number of councillors this will result in to the accountability of those counselors as a single member representing that Ward it allows for communities to have a counselor closer to them and for that councillors it be closer to the community rather than a more distant relationship conducted over a wider area single-member Ward 's also allow for a wider range of people to stand for election and to allow a wider range of people as sending a better chance have been elected not least because it makes the election campaign cover a smaller area and therefore makes it more affordable and therefore more accessible to more people now I 'm in a unique position at the moment has been the only single ward councillor around this council table and I 've got to say that that has been a positive experience I don 't believe that a local focus and a citywide view are actually mutually exclusive I think it 's quite possible to balance both of those a well-connected counselor can be an excellent local advocate at the same time has been a very effective City governor and I believe a single council have been be more across those local issues and to be a better advocate than for them here at the counsel table in addition to the work that the community board are quite rightfully doing in that space advocacy at the counsel table based on a good understanding of a local community and its needs can surely only be a good thing when this is also carried out with an effective metropolitan approach and I believe that this can be done I certainly don 't believe that the tour in any way mutually exclusive Phil and I also strongly oppose the concept of voting at large for a council and and certainly believe that single member Awards a local level give the best representation I think once you combine wards and like even like we currently have some of the combined wards are populations of over 60,000 people surely that 's the beginning of voting at large or it has been and like 60,000 people is greater than the whole population of invercargill we 've been talking about two councillors representing such a large area so and the argument that in fact that in fact part of the job of governance at the counsel table is that we make decisions and the interests of the whole city and I would expect that counselors would continue to do their the the pre-engagement certainly showed that people wanted to have more contact with their local councillor that means that in fact a smaller local area or single Awards is really what people expected and the I think it 's been raised that in fact the whole the size of the ward isn 't just like a population or Geographic const construct there are many wards where we have special separate ethnic communities the whole and it 's been referred to in a discussion about you know the concept of much of our city bit and the wards having a socio-economic basis that there 's quite they 're quite distinct communities and in fact everybody has to be represented so this gives having single-member Ward 's gives us counts the opportunity of having the best representation David thank you like everyone else I think representation at large is not something that I would favor I heard speakers today talking about democracy being closer to the people localized issues then we have a community board that invariably covers at least a couple of wards and I think it 's quite beneficial to have two councillors to be able to cover that joint area there will be localized issues Ellie 's raise issues like the flockton basin which may in a restructure just fallen one the responsibility of one councillor and i believe it 's far more advantageous to spread that load we talked other speakers have talked about two councillors covering 60 odd thousand we are now looking at one councillor covering somewhere between 20 and 25 thousand i don 't see that we 're getting any huge advantage by reduction a small reduction and representation there and i firmly believe that with those paired wards and the community board working as a function of of two wards that we get a better ability for issues to be covered by two councils than you would do with one then thank you if you look at the maps for the proposed wards and consider what the scenario no guarantee that some of those areas this is actually puts up at a point that Vicki 's may be but there 's no guarantee that some of those areas would actually be represented around this council table along with single-member Ward 's we enhance and we make greater equitability of representation in the city in my view also with multi-member wards in multi-member Ward 's there 's still the chance that smaller voices will be drowned out by larger and so I do support this promotion of the single member wards so to enhance the voices of all in our community Apple I agree voting at large is it will be a mess a mistake however I 'll do as she believed that multi representation and the award is actually important it gives a chance for diversity you know it really easy for one councillor to take a particular stand and driver board in a particular direction but a double two councils in a particular wall could certainly balance it out the other part two is obviously if there is an issue with one counselor or something happens and as well as something that 's important and so you know is a I 'll be supporting the 2 councillor for a waddle multi council approval riff yeah there 's beings a very good and persuasive arguments on both sides here but I think the thing for me is around the community representation and I think one of the issues we 've tried to push as a council here as being more delegations to community boards I don 't think we 've achieved that yet in this term and what worries me about shifting the inner way down the hierarchy of representation bringing counselors down to that single Ward level is actually that you will marginalize the community board representation aspects and that 's what we 're trying to actually improve I think the submission that I found the most persuasive was sure Issa 's one where he actually took the representation at the national level with an MP representing a large wood to councillors and then so full community board members for the individual boards and I think that 's what we should be looking at so i mean here but I do worry that if we have one counselor in the little Ward it will actually be doing the job that the community board is supposed to be doing and I think that 's what we 're trying to improve upon and that 's kind of the community level representation that we 're trying to improve and actually give them more work to do and actually a lot of community board members complain to me they don 't have enough to do they don 't have enough responsibility so I think you know shifting to whatever 16 wards great that 's fine with community board members being elected from that ward then I think as you got the hierarchy the counselors then get elected from the next level up which is a wider geographic area so that they can actually work across that whole area and then take that up to council level so that 's why I would support the election at large within a community board area okay I mean I think that 's a really good debate so and I knew that it would be that the consideration of the of the issues because the and it 's been done really well just to comment on that the electoral wards for of the literal boundaries for the Parliament parliamentary seats the trouble was is that they go into the y mackie we did waimakariri district council went into the Selwyn District Council so we don 't get a perfect match but it is something that is worth considering I think for the future but I wanted to put on the record my concern that with our you know desire to achieve you know that the the kind of mix around the council table that would give you a good decision-making framework in terms of dealing with complex problems complexity requires people with different views different backgrounds different points of view to be able to come to the table and enter really Thresh out our shoes you don 't get that on geographic basis and that 's to me the the real shortfall and the legislative framework and that 's why I 'd like to put on the record because at some stage I really think young people specifically represented at the table not having to one award on a geographic basis to do so whether you know we want someone from you know particular particular interest groups or identity groups sitting around the table to help us resolve issues that are extremely challenging so I just think that there probably are other ways of identifying communities of interest other than geographic ones and geographic communities of interest are you know particularly you know we 're particularly aware of them because of what we 've been through but communities of identity and communities of interest go well beyond geographic boundaries so that 's something that I would like the local government Commission to be recommending to government next time it reviews the local literal wait anyway so let 's let 's have the probably the easiest way to do this is to have a resolution that makes it makes it clear whether the preference is to join the wards together so that we have that the initial year but but then there 's only two options really that 's the single Ward 's or the joining on first because they 'd see what the view of the council is yeah we would do that but that 's not the bigger sure I mean I think people are generally quite happy with voting at large you know I mean I could put that resolution first which I don 't know that there is actually a specific resolution know that we deal with that at the end you know ok so we could put the book will put the can you go to the draft resolutions the ones that the big ones that we do at the end all right look no look let 's just deal with this first and then I 'll come come to their joining together of the wards as they 've been presented to us I think these are differentiation between those two things so those of us who support to member wards may not necessarily support basically banging what we 've been presented okay all right well we 'll just put the initial proposal then we 'll put that first okay so the first resolution and I needed a mover and a for the sake of having a having dealt with that after considering submissions council confirms its initial proposal that for the 2016 local authority elections the Christchurch City Council members other than the mere are to be elected by the electors of wards rather than by the electors of the district as a whole it 's a technical resolution and seconded by tongue so I 'll just a small area doesn 't matter just well obey war okay yes so I will just put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried unanimously so that 's fine so I 'll now put the that the initial proposal of single-member Ward 's be confirmed as the council 's final proposal so i 'll put that that 's been moved and seconded so can you put the so this is the initial proposal that we 've gone out work that we confirm it as the final proposal that they be single member wards hey so that 's been carried so the rest of the resolutions so that 's clear yeah so do we need to other ones okay so so in that case we 'll take a break for lunch and reconvene at 12 45 or we or are we bringing the food back on it 's just out the back yeah yeah well til 1245 yeah just under 30 minute _"

    "text": "yes understood they would pick us this community board good morning yeah yeah yeah welcome thank you so you got our submission here and I 'll just take it that you 've read at all and I can just talk to it now if you 'd like okay let 's get right under general comments I think the underlying concern board has as as our wards recovery as a bit slower than other wards and they 're in the city and we the other other concern we have is if we make radical changes we could jeopardize the representation at a local level when it 's the collective view to retain and improve with local inclusion does that make sense and under ward boundaries the board 's view is that we feel that Linwood is not associated with the coastal environment which builders there 's a great deal of separation between Linwood and we were created by the residential read zoning and there tends to be more more alignment forelimb word to the CBD district because of its proximity to the inner city and that the board also feels as assigned to the beer would Ward if you put Linwood and was barely at the other end of the were at the north end of the ward we 'd like to retain Preston 's in particular because we feel that there 's more alignment for Preston 's with the coastal environment and there 's an attachment there to bottle lake forest in the open space and the recreation focus a lot of people that are living persons have Preston 's gives the ward a balanced socio-economic population which we feel is important and through the residential read zoning process has been clearly identified to those leaving the zoned areas as the apreas preference to retain an Eastern way of life that they live in Preston 's and I think the other s vectors by retaining Preston 's we are providing more of a recovery aspect to those that are living in the east and the other points I wanted to make under 7 and this also relates to the the mouth of perceived marshal ins or the proposed Martians ward we feel that a Martians Road boundary retains continuity for retains the coastal environment which is the way of life which I 've said earlier but Preston 's identifiers very very closely with the forest the beach and we don 't know the demographic says yet it 's too soon to know but we feel that that will become an important issue for than a few within the next year 's we wanted to float the suggestion that there is potential for reestablishing a more western boundary than Martians road that 's not a the second option we see the main north road as the next potential option due to the significance of main arterial roads as defining communities of interest what about the motorway going on don 't you think that creates more natural boundary yes it does so that that that is and that 's further east then yep yeah yeah I agree this is this is not our preference right it 's it 's really another possibility yeah but the reason we wanted to bring this up was because there is a community of interest on the east side of the main North Road that matches the say look in Preston 's Martians and Martians redwood a natural boundary would be the stacks over bridge to the north and the railway lines meaning the north of those those boundary markers would would be retained in the pepper new board the south boundary being the expressway route just south of st. leads college but our main focus as really we would like to retain Preston 's and have emotions road boundary to the north I think where the borders has a view that peps Brooklyn dispensable could be combined and there 's no real when when we discussed that there was mixed views generally favoring that inclusion though enter the coastal sagging into the coastal yes board here I think with the residential red zone in there as well and Brooklyns that 's some quite favorable to include it yes yeah who knows what 's going to have in the future there it could could be added on to the bottle lake forest for instance it 's right yeah so there are main points okay David I think just a clarity the reference to the main North Road Martians road up to the Waimakariri bridge oh not the main road hasn 't Belfast sorry that I was hooked onto the wrong one so actually that the alternative boundary that I suggested sexually is a motion motion road and then the old main north road up the average but actually the the old main North Road will connect on to the northern arterial anyway so actually the northern arterial makes a better sense to shoot you because we want to shift that boundary I think it was one of the submissions that we had around qe2 drive because that we split a community of interest up there from as I recall from one of the other submissions and I think the other interesting point and you know we look at creating ward boundaries with mesh grid 's and there is quite a rural element to a lot of that pop area and a natural boundary probably aligns better than the mesh grid at all and and the the amount of population by including marcin road as the boundary wouldn 't substantially over the numbers hugely with that electro or here we 're also in a probably reducing number environment you know so you know we can use the the minus side of the plus side of the coin on the side it was interesting at times when you look at the Electoral Commission they do talk about natural boundaries and communities of interest so natural boundary is more likely to contain our community of interest dinner never a good block of times yeah MP words got some interesting issues as well because it splits of community and Travis so any even the between the coastal and the beer would ward where you 're dividing to know yeah that 's what I mean Travis I call it truth country oh no no dear tomorrow pie which also leads on to the bottle leg so I mean I I think that we 've got the right general concept in place it 's just that I think some of the boundaries need to be with just tweet yeah yeah but that 's that that 's quite favorable really what you 've seen so that 's not very helpful are there any other very much Linda that 's brilliant thank you so now we 've obviously got a process now to go through so that 's the end of the formal hearings and I just thought that I while we were still you know live streaming that I would just establish for the record what the next step of the process is and then I 'm going to adjourn this meeting until next Monday and the reason that I 'm are joining it till next Monday is that 's the day that we will come back here at 11am to formally deliberate on the submissions and recommend than necessary resolutions to counsel and then we 'll have a formal meeting on the 18th of november and that is when we formally decide to notify the the new wards the for the representation review and we and then we publicly no spy that on the twentieth and it is at that point that the public are invited to make submissions but those submissions are referred onto the representation the local government commission so and ended as the local government commission if I mean if there are some proposals that I think that we as a council are going to want to consider so I 'm going to start the process of just you know I don 't like to use the word and stretch staff but request that staff met options that take into account the following and I 'll just I 'll just run through them so staff have been obviously taking notes as we 've been going through as I hear those others here is just picking up on the main recommendations so we 're going to ask staff to make an option and so these are options and so these are not decisions these are just options that we will be looking at two met banks peninsula Ward as in the status quo and that obviously has a significant flow-on effect to the other wards and so we will obviously ask them to present that the best possible grouping of communities of interest based on the submissions that we 've received two beasts group them in order to meet the required number of awards in terms of the banks peninsula community ask them to prepare options around a couple of alternatives one is that there are the two separate community boards as the current as is the status quo so agora War II were Littleton mount Herbert we will also ask them to met an option which brings Littleton mount Herbert and to a combination with award over the hill if that 's a technically creative way of describing it and we will also ask them to make a single banks punch low community board so there are the three community board options these are just options that we 're putting on the table yeah I think that 's a sensible process and choose of us getting more information it just seems to me when I 've looked it up and I guess it okay can I can I finish the list sorry I 've got quite a few so I want I want staff to map an option which redefines the boundaries of the Central Ward so that it takes in the East the eastern the neighboring communities around that the sort of the lynnwood or woolston side of the option and that these are not decisions as I 'm saying these are just asking people to make options so that we can actually see what these options look like an option for a separate community board just for the Central Ward so without a combination with other Ward 's but a community board solely for the Central Ward the end this would also allow 4-6 Metro community boards but if there are other options that would allow six Metro community boards and if yet then a preference for a mechanism for allowing that to happen and also for ensuring that all wards know that a model whereby the numbers of wards that make up the community boards are equalized obviously the I think the coast award and the who 's reward have generally been supported we want to look at name changes so potential name changes of those could be considered in light of the submissions which asked us one to look at whether we can find a sort of a more neutral way like coastal rather than picking up just one element of the thing and to look per the submissions on woolston Phillips town i don 't know--i the university area church corner rally hoon hay st. Albans papanui and burwood around Travis and bottle lake and are there any other specific items yet Phil look that 's a good lust lien and I think getting more information and especially via maps will be really useful for us to help us with those options and decision making it just seems to me when I 've looked at it too and there was a suggestion from one of the submitters today that in fact it 's going to be really challenging if in fact a sink banks peninsula was to be a single Ward the transfer of the pot relations and to the metropolitan areas how we would manage that or that will be managed within another 15 wards and it just seems to me when I 've looked at it and I 've done a couple of these before it 's going to be really hard so I just think to help us it will be useful if in fact we would have an alternative as well say 17 words so that we can do a comparison so just it 's probably a bit more mapping and we meet monday but it just seems to me if in fact especially to achieve the communities of interest and the population changes if that isn 't is going to be too hard we 're going to need another another option not a wider option that the trouble was us that the time that we have available to us is as literally next Monday for decisions that then finally direct the all of these mex were done with what prior when we had the discussion about the numbers of wards that we would have so it 's not impossible for us to look at them but we did yeah we did yeah it took a lot of work being done I just wanted what Chitwood staff in fact if that is doable that 's all yeah i think it is doable but i just warn of the fact that we made a decision as a council that we would have 16 grams of those online and and that is the in a situation where we don 't meet the deadline because we 're going to use a lot of debate time around the numbers of councillors it 's it 's not just I look I agree and it 's it 's F for example what the changes its rich say it was to be virtually impossible to do that we then would have a fallback position of another option to consider well the fallback position that I would like to propose as this there if the if the local government Commission does not support the retention of the bank 's financial award on the basis that it does not fit whether the threshold that has been established by law if they determine that that does not exist that we put up a proposal that we retain the existing arrangements for another three years and that those existing arrangements be completely reviewed over those three years and that we use the census results which will be undertaken again and 2016 so that 's next year there will be another census once all of that data is analyzed and 2017 we would boundaries without the pressure that this council has been under due to the sort of extreme financial issues that we had to confront when we were first elected so I think that it would be I mean I 'm really pleased that we have done everything that we possibly can and I want to as well along with others who commented as well congratulate staff on the quality of the engagement with the wider community and the way that they have brought this work together but I also want us to basically have a fallback position that says that that this city has been through enough and I actually personally think that the real reason that people haven 't submitted on this isn 't because they think that they we 've got an absolutely right and it 's exactly what they want I just don 't think people care they 're just exhausted they 're actually worn out with the amount of consultation and engagement and various things that are going on in their lives you know people would much rather get out the house rebuilt than to care about in the next election so I would much rather that we had the time to do this really really well and and to actually I think confront the real issue which is that the legislative framework does not really allow for the proper representation of of councils that have come together with a small a small district council then combined with a large Metro Council it 's just never confronted that issue and the legislative framework doesn 't allow it this plus or minus ten percent is just not fair on a community that had a small council and now has this it deals with a major metropolitan area and to be honest I don 't think that we as a city deal so well with these smaller rural areas that are the bread and butter of the small councils small district councils there are always going to be you know significantly challenging issues that we have to confront so so that that 's the full-back position that I would like is that we retain our existing wards that we have the next direction based on our existing wards and a basis for taking it further I accept that that 's that 's of you and I 'm not so sure that the existing Arrangements though and again are going to lead to the fair in its proportional representation and and achieve the changes which in fact a huge amount of work has gone into and that is why as a comparison I would still ask for for comparison purposes and it is another fallback position for consideration for 17 and that that 's all it 's because particularly because I don 't think that the existing Arrangements fear currently especially given the population shifts after the earthquake and all of the all of the submissions that we 've received so that 's the reason I would still think we should have another option yeah but at the end of the day it 's not us that decide or and actually it shouldn 't be asked that aside I mean I the more I think about this the more I think about the representation review process I think communi he should be utterly engaged in it but at the end you know we all have a conflict of interest in many respects we all represent communities of interest under existing wood arrangements and you know we all have views on those at the end of the day it 's the people of Christchurch that have to determine what the what what their position should be and we 've heard loud and clear from the smallest part of our entire council that they will feel utterly swamped if they have to come unto a city ward and actually the city ward that they would come unto it she feels exactly the same way about swamping them so and and and and running ragged the person that would be representing such a broad base so you know I honestly think that we have to you know take into account all of these matters but we 're going to prioritize 16 that 's the that 's the decision that we already made but obviously there are others that have already been matched because the council staff did that work and the lead up to the decision that we talked and therefore if it information will be available again I 'm Tam I think it 's a bit too early to be talking about a fallback position I want to see from today the information or staff can be good so I don 't want to actually discuss a four bit position when we put it out for public discussion if we go out with the banks peninsula Ward is in the status quo on it will go to a hearing no no we can guarantee it will go to a hearing if we don 't put it out as the status quo there is no guarantee it will go to a hearing so we wouldn 't have a fallback position I think if we if we know that it 's going to go to the local government Commission we have to have a fallback position I realize it but I that 's not next Monday yeah start for coming back with information yeah put this on I don 't see the phone yeah it 's a good idea to have one because I mean the last time that it went to the last was you know that individual counselors appeared and gave evidence against the council 's position yeah I mean it 's just crazy it wasn 't arity that won 't hit you well what we can 't but it would be really neat if people said that they would take that position do a result we don 't do resolve it now but that 's something we should discuss informally move that counselors dunce we don 't you do that easy but but ever ever ever ever feeling about it but I just I think we should have an agreement amongst ourselves that once we get to a decision that 's the decision that we should support because I think that it 's very confusing for the local government commissioned to have conflicting arguments yani yeah just wasn 't clear on your first option which was to leave bank Spencer as a status quo do you mean basically amalgamate the other 15 wards and to the urban area so it seems to meet it the issue that phil was raising what which is what I support um given all the witness to have as a modification to that option the ability to staff to say will actually do the most logical way to do it is actually to add maybe one extra water in the urban area and then that enables a more reflective position then it also lowers the deviation so it strengthens I think the argument if you want Alyssa to stand alone so because I mean I think there 's it 's not just about geographic areas there is a huge amount of work that staff have done around you know the early engagement around representation around things like voter turnout areas of common interest and all the arguments that the peninsula has made for example you can make in some yeah I just said look we 'll prioritize 16 but yes the option will be dead as well so we will get back work done thank you yeah all right why is she supported me too sir position yeah you know starting to create new new alternatives to what we discussed to me is really really bad bad process because I could people yog you 'd ever yeah okay so now let me just let me just tell you what so we 're all agreed that that that that staff will go ahead and do that do you need a resolution to actually sort of confirm that or can we just accept that staff have been asked to do this okay we 'll minute what we 've been asked to do um so this afternoon we have a an informal workshop with the community board cheers so that we can consider just some of those little detailed boundary issues so that that 's going to be really helpful and the other although I don 't actually think we 're going to need very long to do that because it sounded to me like everyone agreed with each other when they were talking about moving things on either side but just to just so that we can pour over maps which would be deeply uninteresting to a live-streamed broadcast and the second thing is is there on Friday rather than having a workshop we 're going to have an informal briefing of counselors we want to look at proposal around banks peninsula is definitely outside the minus ten percent so and we also want to look at the demographics and that picks up all of the issues around the numbers and the numbers of wards as well so on Friday we 'll have quite a good again session but that 's that 's really just to make sure that we 've covered off everything that that that that we have expected to be cupboard off just on friday there is a child friendly cities function which i 'm not i 'm aware there 's a number of councillors that you put the end up to go to right at the beginning of that so what how you figure out who they are and maybe a year rearrange the schedule because i think fridays sessions can be quite important that we all be there yeah i don 't know i don 't know i 'm sorry good start that 's just from one to two is it child for me then for Monta too desperate so we can start one here we can start it to ya alright so now formally adjourn this meeting until eleven o 'clock on monday and at eleven o 'clock on monday we will be in a position to debate the proposed amendments to the to the maps that we produced for consideration based on the submissions that we have received focused entirely and exclusively on the elements of the representation reviews frame of reference and we will then and and that will be the decision that then informs the final development of the maps and they will come back to us the final sign-off on the 18 yep oh and the do any of the deputy chairs that are here today i welcome to stay for this afternoon session right so i will adjourn the meeting thank you _"

    "text": "Sun mount here but community board por la Morena or take a 4000 hina holo aku hoop a turkey hello from Littleton mount here that community board I don 't envy you this Rubik 's Cube of a decision I just want to talk briefly about the process that we arrived at our submission which I 'm sure you will read I 'm not going to bore you by picking things out of it but there was those kind of defining your community meetings which were quite well attended and in our community the key message that came out of those was yes keep the peninsular intact does had always been aboard objective and continues to be so but and and initially the board accepted the thesis that having equal numbers within all the wards was a fairer situation and we worked hard to to make to to kind of enable that you know to accept that proposition and then we thought about which bits of Christchurch would best fit with banks peninsula at a board workshop once the initial proposal was out little to Mount Herbert community board hosted end diamondharbour to discuss what what we drafted our initial a position on the initial proposal to discuss that and it was after these that it was a bit of shift in the board 's thinking members began to begin to see that what was gained in fairness was being lost and effectiveness when we when we reread our the notation about Herbert community boards submission to the previous review which is attached to our submission we be we began to think well actually what has changed and not not that much had I think that fairness is not just about equal numbers it 's about it 's also really about how easy it is for people to participate in decision-making not just formally but all the multiple informal ways that you 'll know happen when you 're an elected member so hence our submission I just want to say that it 's now nearly 10 years since some algal nation and from time to time we still get a sense that there is some residual resentment in the city about the way banks furniture was foisted on the city want to belong to the city and we want you to the city to feel that banks furniture belongs and yes banks peninsula is distinct but I take the view that all the separate communities and Christchurch a distinct and we should while celebrating those differences should also all be part of one big hole so questions please right Phil and then yay thank you I just want to ask you about the possibility of for example if council recommend that the peninsula is remains as one Ward how having would it be possible for one community board with subdivisions to actually work I just like you 're sort of view on their Paula my view is that I think it would but it 's not something that I can speak for the board on thank you and the the other question well it was greedy if you might liberate about your comment about fairness and people participating in decision making because clearly and you say that it made that point of your submission to about how the Act doesn 't require fair representation if it prevents effective representation last wondering if you could elaborate on that okay so hard of the eighth in a community like ours with the small population that we have and the number of community board members in particular there we are able to enjoy all my citizens are able to enjoy almost personal relationships or you know quite that they have a feel close they feel caught in contact I don 't know whether that 's the same intense very hard for me to judge but if we go down if the initial proposal is is adopted and we go down to two communal members where there are currently five there 's no way those community board members are going to be able to get around to all the residents association meetings and the various water meetings of its yet but i think if the peninsula was a single well it is a single ward but if it was a peps had a single community board well the same situation would arise because it would be fewer fewer elected members to do all that work so so in fact what it was but if some challenges or even difficulties I think of all the people yep I think it would know the way the way the the geography of the peninsula is that these these two big basins and then these barriers between them and yeah okay thank you for Yanni yeah thank you thank you for your submission I 'm just I 'm trying to understand the argument that we would make if we kept the peninsula as a isolated community I can understand it from an echo role point of you will possibly for little rubber but I struggle to understand until the arguments for little time when it 's quicker to get from London to the council than it is from Scarborough or some no or other places maybe to the north little study so does anything unique about the little son situation that would mean that you know it should be treated as an isolated community enough so what 's the what 's the kind of arguments for that to occur when youth quakes happened littleton was cut off for quite a few weeks we 've got the tunnel which where I so there 's three points you can get to the three or four places that you can get a little to the tunnel there was the Summoner road that 's still closed so that remains went and then dies pass and give his past I mean potentially it can get cut off it is you know there is a the risk of that happening that 's all I can think of at the moment when I noticed some other reasons and the other concern that has been raised if we extend the wardens is taking account sumner or some of those Bay 's communities is that those areas will have councils a liquid for the entire Peninsula that that scene is unfair but if you look at the recent history of sense of amalgamation the little knock favorite area has always had the counselor it hasn 't had anyone from a Corolla so do you think it 's a fair reason if we were going to extend the boundary to take into consideration that that the population differences in terms of littleton and summer compared to say a most likely that the counselor will be elected from this a lot of about hills now Herbert because of the population died note that currently exists which seems to be the argument that we shouldn 't extend into summer because that will have even less chance of a local council be represented for that aurora area I think I understand your question yeah what can you do doesn 't it happen every week well but I mean I think if you look at our initial proposal the idea is to get more local wards to reflect the engagement that that we 've had from people so in terms of that fear and effective representation yeah that 's why I 'm interested in the ocean so can I just I 'm not still not quite sure I understand your question so agoura what I was saying that it 's unlikely that they 'll ever get a counselor from the award if the bank 's little wood gets extended to include the port hills communities Justine it 's increasingly unlikely that after all worry we 'll we 'll ever get a city he 's the bank 's financial ward that sumner would determine who the cancerous for that area because of the population yeah sheer numbers that seems more the likelihood is that would be the case I 'm just trying to understand how about how valid that consideration is given that under the current system it 's the little genetic immunity that determines who the council will be anywhere because of the population Dino it that currently exists so what we just had a number of votes and little turn out outweighs the number of votes in any other part of thanks Lynn chillers that we mean yeah well we have had a camp counselor from diamond harbour and the population on the southern vases about equal to Littleton at the moment in the population and a corollary with subdivision is about equal to Littleton to I mean it obviously the probability is that that this counselor for an enlarged thanks virtual award would come from Mount Pleasant or somewhere on that side of the portals am I still understand your question do you think yeah I mean so the argument not be extended into summer because that will reduce its effectiveness in terms of representation because that council may come from some up but that still means that a Kirara for example because of the population would whatever less chance of having a council well it reduces the probability that somebody from the knowledge and have a basin will be elected and it produces food that the probability that somebody from agora why we would have be elected is that what you were getting it yeah I 'm just trying to understand the arguments that if we have to put forward that we retain the pin answer as a whole the threat of a counselor coming from an area not within that that that existing war given the current situation yeah I mean obviously the the you know the the banks peninsula component is what 's driving a lot of the debate that we 're having so and the question I guess is around whether we should be just focused on the on thanks but unsure as a total or whether we should think of a coral why would rare does that actually extend to two little turn mount her but could that possibly be a community board that joins or part of a community board that joins another ward so I suppose well can I just be very clear that people in Littleton would be strongly opposed to being separated from beings furniture and that is that is the basis of our argument is advanced mature as it is now I must stay intact but but but we may not have that choice so if we don 't have that choice we 're just looking at all other options so the proposal that would put out there is to bring us together with Sumner in order to make up population yeah but I understand that and we were ok about that initially because it did keep things from sure intact right so anything that that so if the proposal was that there be a separate banks peninsula board but that in fact the the separate community board doesn 't connect with you know your community board doesn 't connect with the across the whole I mean a fuel community were able to retain banks modular but you but you not I see what Ben yeah sorry so you 'd rather have it that you you 'd rather have a fit if that happened you 'd rather stay with the summon award being included some are being included with the whole banks financial award the message we get from the residence of being mature as they would rather stay with our or whatever yes but if that 's not an option is it better to make the whole ward inclusive of Sumner or to allow your community board to join another another councillors Ward area if you see what I mean what I 'm trying to say is is that we could have we could have a bank 's potential award which includes a Carrara why we were and includes Littleton mount Heather so the ward as the ward but the community board might join with another ward so your council would be represented on the community board but you would have so free immunity for two or three members honor honor honor doing it was only other side of something well oh yeah young just the same where other community boards are doubled with two or three wards of making up a community board video yeah so that that 's the question as is that I mean work and many respects we 're looking for fall back positions on something I and don 't know yeah I 'm not sure that people would be that comfortable about that possibility so you 'd rather stay with a summer thanks financial award then to break your community board even though that would give you a broken community board anyway you see what I mean are you okay yeah so I 'm just anyway obviously not then we 'll play around around with him what were the options Andrew maybe Im put a couple of questions that we announced a slightly different way if the Littleton mount herbert communities border were not able to maintain the status quo would the little to mount herbert community population prefer to amalgamate with the a Corot while real community board to form a banks peninsula community board or to amalgamate with the existing ferry mead my instinct is that that they would rather amalgamate with the girl why reworked community board and keep banks furniture intent and to come back to the question that Jonnie was raising around isolation we 've heard from the communities on the ferry mead side that they essentially look into the city and don 't feel there 's a community of interest necessarily with littleton to the extent that the preferred model as put out yeah it I 'm working on an assumption the lyttelton harbour communities are connected strongly so governors Bay diamondharbour littleton and so on do you believe that when you take the lyttelton harbour community as a whole that looks out to the rest of the peninsula or feels a stronger connection with the rest of the peninsula than it does with the summer mount pleasant very mood and so on it 's kind of the same question as the community board honestly and the answer to that is that all the letters and harbor communities identify more strongly with banks peninsula they see themselves as being selection of people than they do then they do to remember only a few of them access those communities through the tunnel anyway yep so if you had I mean many of them coming through baking them ordered this is the this is the sort of kind of the other question which is can you really have it both ways your are a few one community why have you got two separate community boards would it be would it be a fullback position then that you have a banks peninsula community board that that would be that would def back position would be preferable to the alternative user coming over the hill so you do okay but now it 's mine yeah very helpful in response to your have a have it both ways the problem with having any weight doesn 't it 's not us it 's not you having it both ways it 's in terms of the argument that you put to the local government commercial which is we 're arguing an isolated community I 'm afraid you 're not that isolated from us no that 's true yeah so I 'm looking for all sorts might be a better outcome that what you 're saying is is that from your perspective it would be a better outcome I 'm not sure if a Corral why Rio would agree because it 's such a big job to connect with that community with with little time out here but so it 's yes it 's not last question well I 'll shape are we really saying to us look altogether thanks Peninsula is a very clear community of interest yes that I think for me that now is idea oh it doesn 't nail it as far as the local government in Russian goes okay because that 's not the only thing that drives them and it 's well outside the team percent range say that it 's a key perimeter yeah I am trying to be helpful despite the appearances to the contrary so all right I think thank you very much Paula and last but _"

    "text": "Davidson surely Papa noe community board another six synced submission thank you first let 's just like to acknowledge staff for their great work they 've done on this process I don 't want to concentrate too much on the council wards and we do support the 16 but obviously I guess is in the community community boards themselves we feel that having three awards connected to make a community borders to too large and when you look at our current water leap Avenue going out to be central Marshall and pepper know we 're stretching from morehouse air dried out to the Y Mac river and that 's a huge area and we just don 't feel it 's right and one of the problems have also got will obviously the increase of counselors it seems to be at a cost to the liquid community board members and community boards which we do not support at all our proposal would be actually to reduce it from three wards 22 currently pretty much what we 've got at the moment and increase the number of elected committee board members because of members in those two wards wouldn 't be enough so we 'd won a minimum of five the first five obviously that had been elected at-large I 'm obviously possibly he got to three from each each board if you wanted them elected and in the wards individually so it 's sort of where we stand is a couple of issues obviously which have heard about a brown the boundaries especially around the historic pepper nui area got some concerns up around the edge of McLain 's above saw his arms we feel that is more associated to that here which could help with the boundary changes to get a historic pepper nui area back in there pretty much that said no I never thing a but also we don 't really support heaven suburbs as the names of the wards well you look at pepper Noah there 's a lot more suburbs in the ER than just pepper nuit so Central 's a good name coast was a good name you know surely Pepin over completely is in shirley from our warden and there 's a lot of way in there it 's just doesn 't quite rent here very good oh that 's very interesting Pauling he 's a secretion and Mike my head to answer this from a personal opinion but we 've hit a submitter querying the boundaries on the I guess the northern boundary of the proposed Central Ward which is currently at least mr. in the police thing that they move up to illness to include Melbourne path in the ribbon suburbanization do you use an opinion about there yeah it 's someone that 's obviously lived in st. Albans for a long time I do feel the st. Albans or the central boundary is probably a street to not North enough so it wouldn 't need to go and Israel specially when you hear all this talk about moving central away from pappadeaux marshlands and put it into Boston land would if you do that and you keep the waters that 's proposed now just let in st. Albans again and the top part of st. Albans will not move move with it so that is of I 've consumed yea though 's around it 's especially to get the mix for the community ball was right would you be an agreement if the council was to recommend an additional committee board for the metropolitan part of part of the city yeah most definitely I know I think obviously banks furniture creates a few issues extra issues when you look at the 16 council Ward 's will be great if you could just say hey this make eight community boards from those six teens it 's not that that 's simple but definitely another Metropolitan Community Board i think is required in there there 's just the numbers aren 't quite right and i don 't think it 's fair representation for the elected community board members excellent okay David the proposals before us advocate a coastal Ward and connecting right along the coast which means part of the existing chili pepper nuit in the northern part would move to a coastal ward what are your thoughts on on that connectivity I think that 's a natural place for actual spencerville to be along with the coastal areas of Brighton so obviously land with the sticks sticks river but when we 're looking at creating boundary changes I think it becomes a natural border long that water thank you there any other and that obviously you you 're comfortable with the proposals that fiendish and my mari put up around some of the boundary changes that would enable the you know papanui RSA to remain in the pub know a side of things I will say yes but I wasn 't listening to more power sayings but I 'm sure it was smart I think I think that their existing boundary is condor wave and in what that does is that keeps the that little chunk of you know from Bligh 's road up to here would road i think it keeps that within the within the pub annoy side of things but i think there 's a bit of a quid pro quo round Miravalle priestling society but i haven 't_''_342.68 I haven 't seen what their specific boundaries are but i think they cross pub new road and to mere about but the thing is that the proposal was going well what 's a little flip into why Mary and they 've got quite a strong miss a business association they figure to us that they did not want their to hitters right it definitely needs to well now definitely needs to be altered to get the whole of that area of pepperoni back into the post pepper nuit yeah so but what happens at the mirror vowel in because essentially the way it is at the moment with the boundary down Pablo road you 've got a split on both sides of the Mirabelle shopping center in ones and your ward in ones and yeah which is not what us currently know so so you think that there is potential for alignment around the mirror veil area to keep that distinctly together while we create a blog League down the other end as well so you could come in a block to get their business area yeah in there because you know there 's a bit of merging between Miraval and in st. Albans and like we 've hit a lot you know the real estate I just obviously be called sin oven when I was young yeah well I lived in I lived in x ray for a while and we still called at st. Albans and people call it pepper newer you know it really depends on what you associate yourself with but I said you could possibly move that block out for Mirabelle out to probably as a Browns rounds road and come down there to capture those so that would be in pendleton y mari well with the new general to pendleton ward yeah okay cook thank you very much that 's very helpful all right thank you _"

    "text": "the work they have done we 've got a few points that we would like to highlight the first pointless that the name of the wards we feel it as a pity to leave why Mary out of the names because it 's a historical name from the way Murray County Council and I think it 's confusing for the members of the public that will drop those names and change them to something totally different because it takes the public a long time to catch up with what we 're doing the next thing is the Equality of the representation we feel that all the boards should be a similar size and we 're not we don 't feel that some boards should be coming together with two areas and so only having four board members and other other Ward 's having sex board members we don 't think that 's equal and I cannot imagine a board with only four members I don 't know how the debate would go you 'd only have two councillors with that it would be six people I don 't know that in some areas but in a lot of areas i don 't think i would be and then we go on to the specifics of the fiendish from memory he would Ward Ward the mirror of our area with the Mets at the moment is going to be split into three and we would like to be able to put the mirror Val precinct society into our area but then up at the top of pepper new road we don 't want the RSA which has been a pepper no II thing for a very very long time yeah we don 't really want that and we feel it should go over to pepper noe and there benefits not that you don 't want it 's just I know it 's not just so you just don 't believe that it belongs with we don 't know the law NOS what 's up a day yeah exactly we don 't believe it belongs with this we believe believe it belongs with Peponi pepper noe and also the mirai on springfield road we 've had this this last tomb and we given the money but we don 't feel that we have a connection with them and that really is another pep inori historical area that perhaps Peponi we should still have on springfield right here yeah and the other one is likely there 's a lot of areas that we don 't feel that we should be heaven we feel that the university should stay and one ward and shouldn 't be split in two so the old training college should be going into riccarton Wigram and not not to us and then that 's mainly a main comments that 's in a complete alignment with fam reklam program on the university side that it be a unified unified in terms of the boundaries for the for the wards and i think that 's that 's pretty powerful we realized that and I don 't think happen obito attitude about what 's we suggesting know so I 'm Pauline just a comment on this around the 0 her mother this is only included in their excluded from our shitty happening yet the last boundary tweaks he 's historically at his proposing it would go to central yeah yes under the existing proposal is it was central yet yes I think they would feel happier with that I think so too i think they have a strong connection was the settlements community yes yeah yes they don 't you thinking yeah i glean info i think thank you thanks tho wit just with the RSA where it is and he would wrote if you 're saying don 't included that what road or street would you have to bring that head I think you 'd have to go down Conda Conda wave all right and take her in harris christened and then we would take a bit of the Sonoran Zelia to pull into the mirror of our precinct society I think that it 's how that would work yeah okay thank you though so they 'll just to clarify and it 's probably especially where the University boundary calendar coincides with the proposed unicycle made Sukhoi room so if it goes to down dove down everything as a boundary in brooke has some mirror indicated wicked and would remote totally to sit Solway ever at the end of the teachers college the is it about wearable finish yes yes at weren 't yeah but that wouldn 't be a problem that sort of done there at the present time in your life so far though you cycle waving people become i think could become possibly we 'd have to look at the mish box maybe but but the cycle the cycle way parts foot there 's on our boundaries anyway so it 's the sack away is not a problem for yes and I don 't think it would be a problem for wicket and local my figure may be chemically andriy yeah thanks Bill any other no I think that it 's incredibly helpful and um I just did what I 'm a little unclear of is the Maryvale precinct society what are their boundaries have we got them written down somewhere I can get them for you hear that would be quite useful thank you yeah I can get them in semen there 's a brilliant thank you thank you right the _"

    "text": "thank you madam near you 've a copy of the board 's submission and you 've also heard and received from many residents and community groups in the heavy fury made ward during the pre consultation period earlier in the year and during the consultation September in October all members spoke with many individuals and groups in their community and are aware of the support for the current headley pyramid community board we would like to thank all of those groups and individuals for their submissions into their support and their work and for their communities the board does support the proposal for 16 boards but is not in support of some of the proposed boundaries or the names for the awards and the board also has concerns with the proposed banks peninsula summer ward in its representation which we 've covered in the submission and I 'll talk to Anna manage the attached to the board 's submission where maps provided with the support of staff showing alternative boundaries for the proposed and would bolster more it 's very similar to what Paul McMahon was showing you just earlier in a muttered key areas within those wards such as the ballston village itchy being in the Lynwood ward instead of in the ballston water and the proposed Mets that we 've provided would address this the board is not in support of the layout of the current proposed Central Ward annual have heard from community groups on this as well we support over being aligned to the east instead of to the north and and supportive submissions made by groups representing the residents in the central city and east to the alignment to the lung word instead of sent Albans the boundary for this water should represent the current communities of interests with a nut server several of the community groups in the inner city in inner city isa submitted on this Bailey from the NSC des residents group called at our family emerged from the Victoria neighborhood association talked about the old city neighborhoods in the central city woolston and would staying together these areas that have not just been linked together since community boards come along come along but since the early years of our city the Peninsula Ward and the community board and the subdivision does not accurately represent the areas in the subdivision the board suggests that bays would be more appropriate and community groups which we spoke to during consultation will clear about this and have also submitted on it Neela pod Linda Rutland suggesting an alternative coastal bays and its submission the board smuts and general support of the proposal for 16 councillors but has concerns with a proposal for one councillor to represent the proposed banks peninsula some reward the board submission questions the workload and ability for one counselor to represent the geographical area and its communities is achievable and will provide the representation proposed it is a case of fear numbers not being the same as effective representation and for that reason along with many groups and individuals the board requests the council argue to local government Commission for an exception to the plus or minus TM Bhasin fair representation requirements for beings peninsula one counselor to represent the proposed rule does not provide for effective representation and puts together communities that have significantly differing interests for example urban and on the meter in the hearings and while they have differing solutions the message is very clear it has been encouraging to see the discussion around the council table during these hearings and the willingness to look at the seguin the board is also not support the reduction in the number of community boards the proposal reduces representation of the grassroots level and the board submits in support of eight community boards for the for the christchurch city with the currently proposed 16 words the board submits that there should be six community boards and metropolitan christchurch and two in the proposed being spent on co simon award and given the board submission point earlier regarding the counselor representation their board acknowledges that the specifics of the a community boards would need to be reconsidered and the board would welcome the opportunity to be involved in thus the board submission refers to Mike Richardson 's report setting community boards and context prepared in 2008 for that royal commission on auckland governance there 's the comprehensive document which is some clear points on community boards the committee board chairs have been discussions on delegations on page 81 it sets out a framework for making community boards effective there are seven key elements two of which are directly related to the current representation review the first that they must have stable boundaries that reflect communities of interest many groups have talked about the good relationship that they have with the current community board and the relationships that they have with other groups which operate within the award a key example is too far away Marsha who you heard from last week splitting Linwood and Linwood from woolston would have a detrimental effect on its community of interest and make the work of the organizations much more difficult there is also a question over the completely different communities of interest which would be put together in the proposed Banks Peninsula ward which we have already addressed the second is that community boards will only be effective as long as they operate with integrity in build and maintain trust the seguin talks to the long-term relationships with the community that a board has and was a key concern for the groups that submitted in as well as those from the coastal bays area the board summits and supportive community boards being established from wards sharing communities of interest one of the key parts of us is that lung wood and wilston should be in the same community board area the board submission includes comment on the number of community board members elected or appointed to each community board as well and as per the local elytra lady root community board must consist of at least four members but not more than twelve the board submits and support of representation that includes a minimum of six members on each community board in Christchurch City while in three Ward community board areas this is easy having only elected for board members in one councillor in each of the proposed banks peninsula or in a toward community board area would be detrimental to the decision-making process is it would learn much diversity in debate and now questions questions are filled thanks for that Sarah and indeed your boards submission ties in very well with the other submissions we had from community groups in your area as you of questions for clarification and it 's around the Central Ward so are you really as your concern really with the boundaries of the Central Ward rather than having a central ward per se is it the current balance the proposed boundaries right okay thank you for that and the other question really is just around the than just for clarification again you 're really saying look for the for that community boards to work effectively you what what you would see needing a need for at least six members so in effect that would be an increase in the number that is that is proposed and there 's especially true for banks peninsula I say it so currently the banks peninsula community boards have six sort of five elected plus plus their counselor so it 's one fewer than the urban community boards and I know that there are issues we know there might be someone away or sick and in really view if you 've only got five and if the council is busy because there 's only one between the two boards or if there 's another of debate and diversity around the table and it might thank you Sarah for purifying that I mean my last question really is if f council as a way of sort of resolving the representation for community boards especially in the metropolitan area what would you be supportive of the possibility of having an additional community board for the metropolitan area yes yes we would like an additional community board problem from that which is proposed yeah and it could be that linwood and wilston become one community board area through it and coastal and spray tan and kashmir 60 thank you yep Andrew thank you Sarah for the submission I 'm particularly interested in the relationship between the fairy me part of your ward and banks peninsula and the way that that 's viewed as part of the initial proposal so you mentioned some capacity issues with capacity issues for the counselor that you felt might affect representation it 's at we 've heard from community groups on the city side of the port hills that they don 't necessarily feel that there is a community of interest with into woolston more as a community of interest that 's right um would that be the board 's view or do you feel that there is a community of interest between the communities on the city side of the port hills and the peninsula what we 've heard from the community is quite clear is that they do see themselves as being quite separate and and the the board of representing the community 's use in this so the the urban areas have submitted quite strongly that they feel more part of town than part of being spun insula and that they feel that having one councillor to represent their whole area where they listen II representation around the table and further question just on the current proposal you 're talking about six members community board yeah does that mean that if we were to continue to look at what 's currently to the little sense under community board you would support three members from the summer side of the hills and three members from lyttelton harbour the sex could include the one councillor so as it would be currently be three and three and the children harbor area heads quite a large geographic area that 's not something we have looked at with the three and three is aboard though oh thank you any other questions just palling sorry yep it could be including so currently being spun angela has six on the energy what including their appointed counselor i 'm thinking more of the city side yeah I 'm thinking either or five plus a counselor or six plus a counselor that wasn 't something we discussed as a board but it would make sense to have as much diversity and debate as possible for good decision-making and if you had say a Lynnwood woolston ward and a bill would coastal then you would only have four directly elected community board members plus the two counselors which would be one fewer for a community board area then does currently though the geographic area but would also be smaller so clean thank you are you a bit concerned and we had a similar thing from pamper for about if say Linwood was put in with beer wouldn 't close and effective representation that you know that would would be swamped a bit by that I the complexities of the coastal issues yeah yeah and the the red zone and coastal issues are really significant in the city um Linwood has a range of issues but they don 't gain as much prominence from often as those ones but they are long-standing issues and we heard very clearly last week from the Longwood organizations two to Fred Roy Marcia in the inner city east that they felt that they would be overlooked if they were part of a larger community board that included the other areas they also see that their key community of interest is with woolston and there are many groups which operate throughout that whole Linwood woolston area and they are ones which have a relationship with the board through various grants and funding and it would make that much more difficult if there was much any other questions no okay I look thank you very much thank you right so um _"

    "text": "because on what Graham community board might more thank you rapidly losing balloon too late thank you madam earring calculus this should be quite brief really and just appreciate the opportunity to when come and present to you two minor changes in their room and their proposed would boundaries that have gone out after some considerable consultation with the community and we reasonably comfortable with the proposal one of the things that that happened was there was a um a bit of an issue around the university of canterbury dugdale campus fear was some that was in the Fenton wood and and the other part of the campus was an in the briquette and Wigram would all the proposed hallsville Richard halls will hornby wicked so um and we 've agreed to to amend that who suggested that that be amended so that the whole of the campuses in one would and we continue to work closely with the neighboring and community board on any issues and the other run issue was the boundary between Rickett and ward and the proposed hornby ward where run safe peter 's church at been in in the home be wood so we did look at initially Clarence Street being the boundary kurla throat sorry cool it 's right but anyway and that 's got a mesh bak so but we 've what we proposed was to ground to move the boundary too well to English street and there was some discussion about whether that boundary should go further but anyway that decision was that recommendation was lost so what we 're asking the were presenting to to you today is that the that the area of Maine South Road English street and your test Road feed the boundary to include them the church corner so run the figures are all there and our submission for you and I don 't think we need to dwell on that anymore other than I 'm quite happy to answer any questions thanks very much Mohan we really appreciate the way the community boards are just sort of going through the the detailed analysis of it and I must admit that you know when I kind of looked at the University of Canterbury I think there 's Mary as the tradition really rather than findell turn because when you think of the campus at xylem and the connection really is worth with the students love and that 's reckon so and it just makes sense on a lot of levels so I really appreciate that if I mean I should take people from the neighboring ward though that I don 't know if Jamie 's got any question that you 'd like to to put on there no I completely agree with you and I think the feeling when Mario community board but you can cure as well great good thank you that 's very helpful Andrew and then Jimmy thank you thanks for the submission Mike and you 've obviously gone into quite a lot of local detail on those boundaries and that 's where you 're useful taking a higher level view council as you 're aware considered different numbers of councillors 14 16 and 19 in particular you haven 't_''_240.209 mentioned any view that the board might have of the number of councillors and the reason that you might support any particular number are well we 've actually kept out of that process because that was the process that went through consultation considerable effort with the with the council itself when it put out the draft proposals and we didn 't really want to as a community board we didn 't really want to interfere in that process the number of counsel suggested number of councillors was set for consultation and we haven 't Delft to go into that we haven 't really gone into into any other matters other than this is after the public consultation these proposed ward boundaries were put out we just seen that there was a minor adjustment done with the with the University of Canterbury and an internal and an internal one with the with the Rickett and hornby boundary hmm but we felt that it 's better to actually let the process go through without trying to modify anything it looks like stage fantastic Thank You Jimmy thank you thank you man my impressions regard you into the boundary said to the victim week when Camille boy you know have a comments or suggestions we got in last week the hosts were resident Association day particular mention no they consider the war boundary should allow projected a future growth because the house were areas faster most a fast across the population area but based on the council the draft a proposal a moment is nearly the tablet n each more than the 22,000 people what 's your point of view because if we consider the community interest you know to assess the kind of the school or community facility osito the waste of a Vaquero they surrounding the area around the two hundred westerns weather might be considered you know to transport on a house where world to Hampi the the world are your opinion well we haven 't gone into bed either but what we 've understood was that done it 's it 's a bit awkward at this stage to project into the few sure when we 're sitting and when we gone through boundary changes and I think there was something and we got a bit of a direction from is we know that this area is kind of increase in population but we from the last census and we can 't sort of bring out a crystal ball at the stage and see what the changes are going to be even though that we do know that that population is going to increase I 'm pretty sure that we are constrict constrained by the the mesh block system and the and the information if we got from lr seats or so i think i agree with you that we have got some that that will happen but i don 't think we can actually suggest to the local government commission and what are the earth to the that that we changed their rules and I might get need some clarification but I think that is the rules isn 't that we 've got to go on the information it was provided by the last thesis so that 's what we do need to use 2013 but we do have that leeway to go Tim person or over so we could just make the fast-growing Ward 's or one set of it you know to exceed under but I understood that there we were to look at how we thought population had shifted since then because I suspect that this is something that we 're going to have to consider in detail as we go through the specific boundaries because i mean i think that the numbers probably are outdated already and that there has been even more growth to the west and possibly even fear the reductions to the east so there 's own ones we want to target for the unders yeah so that 's it that 's it and then turn depths of sort of an internal within three wards of the of the of the wider band really and what we have been dabbling with with the record in part yeah but we haven 't done up until now we haven 't_''_518.0 up until Jimmy 's question counsel change question we haven 't considered that no no any other questions no look thank you very much Mike that 's great that you 're able to sort of draw our attention to that and well done to the community board thank you very much thank you thank you _"

    "text": "what come forward thank you thank you madam mayor councillors there 's microphones working well enough excellent and just to set up with some general Paul means and I want to congratulate the staff and the whole board want to congratulate staff on how they 've conducted this process in particular the pre consultation which I think has helped us I now we 're communities see themselves and the council did well to take that pre consultation seriously and come up with a rich breed a very reasonable compromise initial proposal and in local government people tend to make submissions on things that make them angry in the lack of submissions we 're at least indicate a lack of anger and suddenly a lack of outrage it seems to me from having listened to a lot of the submissions and read all the submissions that people are most concerned to keep their suburbs united and the board certainly shares these concerns we are very very pleased that Sid gnam welcome Eddington and send them all from Paddington those suburbs which have been split for a long time in which was now I just want to talk specifically about some boundary changes and and which all have all been signaled by our community and our in the submission at least this is a bit more legible than thee and then the written submission so over here we have that South hoon hay and the big picture with the oblong around it as South hoon hay which is like high water and right al Street water by hey road currently that is in halls well and it should be in her name and very much those people see themselves as part of hoon hay had various its submissions when people who live there a very strong feeling who know that they want that to be incorporated into the spread and ward and the same goes for that the the upper small the one on my upper right that is has been called hillmorton it 's the Warren presence area with it and in terms of making the numbers work and we 've done calculations on this you can do this if you remove summerfield or western summerfield you can put in cell remove that the next bit which I 'll talk about next but you have to keep that cardinal drive area which is actually connected to Aiden field by roads it 's much of what so with the ex the big red X that 's cardinal dr mish block you can remove that thanks Darrell and the final one on this page that my lower right that is a Western summerfield but a north of it as frankly street at the moment someone feels divided between kashmir and spreyton and it should end people in summerfield want to be and together and the same ward and the preference would be kashmir and in terms of making all the numbers work with getting owned a together and sprayer that 's the most sensible thing to do it 's uncontroversial everybody 's happy with that particular solution you know on the next page this is the Walston boundary now wilson 's not currently in our ward in the areas concerned at the north of it aren 't in our ward and so we haven 't_''_242.27 done as much work on this but just people in philipstown want to be in in the Walston world because of the school now but the one pet in terms of what was in our submission all of wilson proper needs to be in the Wilson Ward the old Wilson area down on the bottom right and and Eastern woolston north of fury road there needs to be connected with the rest of Austin it doesn 't make any sense that the area woolston village should be separated from the rest at woolston and the boundary should be Linwood air or the canal rather than in fury road and this is the terms of specific boundaries this is the last bit this is craycroft craycroft and lauded by kashmir over the north and it 's just a small section of streets but it 's a very discreet community they very cohesive high level social capital people know each other they just hit a massive Garrett sale there you had about was it 40 different households putting stuff out and is very successful this is a small area that 's currently put proposed to be in the halls well where they want to be at that the main thing is to have it all together and that 's currently not so that 's a basic solution to that that boundary issue and that 's that 's the specific proposals that I have the board is also noted that we wish to see the number of urban boards remain at six and sixteen water doesn 't make this a bit more difficult and wield Lee but it 's entirely feasible under the local literal actor have different sized community boards some em for instance you can have some taking up two of the proposed wards and some taking on three that 's entirely feasible but the only hesitancy around there is that if you 're only going to have two members Ward size 4 division to community forums that 's not really viable for board so they would have to have three each and I 'd be I 'd be happy for four ports to be bigger I think that that will be good but it 's entirely feasible and just as small notes on the peninsula it does sound it is if possible and our board submission is silent on this but I do want to note I having played with the numbers myself I think it would be very very difficult to get the boundaries done in a way that keeps the metro suburbs together as the community has spoken so strongly about while also keeping the peninsula as it is I think that probably the best way the most simple way of making network is to add a 17th ward which would give you more to play with I think it would be very difficult otherwise and I 'm sure that you know this but the status quo in terms of the current board arrangements isn 't going to meet the statutory requirements around keeping around not putting communities together that are unlike so that 's not really a solution either so I 'm happy to take questions now Christian 's Jimmy thank you we got into the one question your particular mention the home hey the south she 'll be in the home head area but whether that 's including the south of anderson street because asked a hospital resident association whilst their point of view but they mention because the henderson trees does traditional they are easy access to the kind of the community facility like a library service center etc and also assess to the school where we where we convenience so i 'm not sure nope on the appearance there is a corner of bordered by innocence road yes of debts and currently in record and web room yes in funny that the improvements of the of the guttering there go all the way to the record and warm water and stop at the spray death get water they that area there those people would like to be in the hoon hay in that spreyton ward however to make the numbers work and to keep the optimum amount of people included all of her and hey including that area there is slightly too big to be included with the the changes that we made so in terms of balancing the competing interests the that 's probably the best solution so this South who hey um has been and spray tan haircut for since the puppet Boyle County Council before then so seems to make sense thank you yep um Jamie thanks thank you Paul sorry to play devil 's advocate here I 'm not trying to be provocative but just out of curiosity what 's your view when the press R in their their own server and you 've got a clear majority saying that they of the respondents on you mean the scientific online survey yeah yes so there 's no need for sarcasm I mean it 's did it is just simply people you know responding to a request so you 've raised valid points in its fear and one other nitrogen she 's what 's your name hold on no no no no no he 's asked one question can you just listen to the question just interested what is the view and for whatever reason when a majority of see that they wanted no change and then a second poll that said eighty-seven percent see that they didn 't want more counselors editor what 's what 's the view on that yeah sorry I should have not interrupted you don 't think that 's a good basis for making decisions what I do think is a good basis for making decisions is the written and oral submissions and then there 's quite a different tone and with more levels of precision and where the submissions are pretty clear that a number of councillors is largely uncontroversial some people want fewer until the 14 some people would like more like I would like 19 there 's no secret but I don 't think a stuffed poll as any basis really even for a discussion thank you though thanks Paul cannot it just to clarify just that the board 's views around the hoone hey area it was in response two counts of Chin 's Christian so basically around there you would retain the war want to retain that current boundary of Henderson 's road yes that well yes that boundary of innocence wrote is fine that 's not initiated by just wanting to make sure that all the households on Henderson 's road so the mish blocks should be probably the other side but that there was no submission from households on the western side are in record and wig room and it 's a fine boundary but it 's a very very small number of boundaries so I don 't forget your change thank you and I also just want to ask you about your reasons for suggesting the possibility of say 17 wards and as your lu2 there 's been other deputations around the possibility of 19 but I just want to ask you I 'm assuming or have assumed that your rationale for needing more Wars is because of the difficulty of actually moving those populations if the council recommend retaining banks furniture as a single Ward is it around yes I me my place fundamentally I think that christchurch is under represented but sick into that is the fact that if we want to if we want to banks peninsula to remain as it is and we want to keep the community 's happy that have made lots of you know submissions very clear that they don 't want their community separated it 's going to be very difficult with 16 wards as far as i but i don 't envy the job of people trying to come up with a alternative solution is a it 's a very difficult job so in this is my last question so would the possibility of having an additional community board would that would that mitigate that difficulty do you believe or what 's your view on them if the council decide on an additional community board in the metropolitan area i know i don 't think that i think that 's a separate issue but it 's very clear from our community and from reading the submissions that people don 't want to see a reduction of the number of community boards and what came out and free consultation is that people really like the community boards you know and its really good as it forward gatech to hear that affirmation or the role that community was playing the community thank you might just ask a question just to get me a cleanse oh thank you then I 'm pips if we could have here some updated maps possible updating for what maps also we haven 't updated are them and they 're out that you 've got the document that went out okay that 's fine we may get some variations of the night we made well do but we 've got a directed staff to do that term and yarn ether orders come from what houses offices talking about the pre consultations of the boots involved around summer up to 3,000 people and yet we only had a few technically a few submissions compared to that number do you think from the feed baby you 've got from the communities that we 've talked to etcetera that the reason for that is that the free consultation process was extremely good or your thoughts on I think that is part of the reason I also think that the council theories put a very reasonable initial proposal now you know and I i want to add again that the concern for people whose dear communities not being separate separated in two separate Ward 's there there 's a number one concern I think that 's that 's a fair assessment yeah Yanni thank you um just on page different colors can just explain what those colors of honey it 's it 's the that there 's just a different mesh blocks right and what does each color represent are there it 's so dark green is decile one at least deprived can and read a creed there 's no dark red deer less than most deprived so yellows in the middle and then just um my understanding is that um you know you went up and talked with the local government tional you had some presentation around the process I just wanted I want no times up but if you could just go through the kind of tests that council is supposed to do as part of the review rather than just you know the cost and the number of councillors there 's a whole bunch of other stuff that my understanding is that council has to consider in terms of fear and effective democracy what we 've got that information that 's the that 's the legal requirement that we 're going through so I mean the overworked counts as one of the considerations that we take representation but cost cost is not a consideration you know I know that but we know what the rules are in terms of what our consideration is and we will we will have the entire checklist in front of us when we make the decision yeah but the somebody was asked to respond to a stuff survey and a bit yani could you just stop the please thank you thank you very much for presenting hall that was great _"

the constant change the FOI river community board has been involved in a considerable number of discussions last of all starting last year and then throughout the year so we had special meetings with our communities we had a draft that we put out to our community and then we formulated our submission from that so just remind us of what the in the 2005 decision when when we were looking at amalgamation with the city and the local government real but there was a local government reorganize or reorganization order notice number 8 126 that I decision that came out of that the local government Commission that Satan there below that talked about retaining beats furniture as a separate ward so I am I look at that and I think well what has changed since then and I also think that the love of local government Commission did direct that this exception beard looked at when we revert the echo I really better when it was being reviewed but at that time we hadn 't had the earthquake we hadn 't had a number of things that have happened to us since then so the edgar oh why we 're a community board is concerned that if we cannot come with a writ up with a reasonable structure for the Christchurch City Council the decision made by the local government Commission might severely affect us and we will lose our identity I would hate that decision to be made by the local government Commission me and we 're all split up so we continue to ask ourselves what has changed for thanks for lunch alone look at the earthquake we could even suggest that we 've today the repair of a number of facilities is taking time and a parar continues to receive many cruise ship passengers these cruise ship passengers continue to create issues for our community and many believe that this industry has impacted on our local tourist industry so there 's been considerable debate around that the new structure going forward and in getting the right population to that 's that 's required to fit that the same wealth of the the need of all areas to be more or less the same size and practically with a population with an ax plus or minus ten percent of each other so then I just carry on down there to outline a few things about our boundaries about our geography I talked a little bit about their about the isolated community that we still believe we are and then at the bottom there I just talked about a few more of those urban rural issues so then if we look just as our air arm our submission ourselves that we made and I think they 're quite clear and succinct moving forward but if will ever have a elected member from the Littleton or even the echo I rira area that it will be led by someone from the some near just purely because of population they 've got the numbers so is that very fear on our our community so is the rest of us that we will never be part of that or never be able to be a part of that process unless we 're woods kids or we 've got something eccentric about us and able to conjure something up with that commute that with those particular community or that particular community the summer community to consider us so I understand leave it at that most few comments that I 've got but they 're all there on there all those things are very important to us particularly the Runanga and them all being together we want to work together we already work together now and it will be said to know two disjoint them so i 'll leave it there yeah Pam I 'm sure that you 've been following the submissions as we 've been going through this question if we were able to present to the by way of our proposal that we notify the retention of the of the ward at the ward boundaries as they currently are with potentially a fallback position then you would be supportive of that yes yes when you say potentially as they are you mean as what they are you presenting them to us now we 'll know as they are oh the old they are not totally we 're been looking through that it 's been working well if it 's not broke why not nymphets I think our motivation has been to comply with what we believe to be the requirements of the of the previous decision of the local government commission but and and not reflecting on the fact that membership of the Commission 's changed but actually reflecting on our obligations we 've been out there we 've consulted and actually I have to say the Summerfield people feel just as strongly about it as do the little turn and agro of people so it has felt very strongly on both sides of the proposed new and so I think that gives us a pretty strong basis to go back to the local government Commission with a notified change that that sees that I mean I 'm not speaking for the rest of the council but I think that we 've all been impressed by the fact that it 's not been a one-sided argument it 's actually been across the board there 's been the view that the that the sward deserves to be separately represented our fill thanks Pam can I just ask you I 'm assuming from your comments and Lakewood that you would agree with what the little female rabbit or also saying and where they refer to that attack the etsy the Commission 's guidelines 2014 that the actor does it doesn 't require a fair representation when that would prevent effective representation of isolated community so you would agree with our title isn 't totally and mean fair representation it seems to be just based on numbers a population and we 're as effective as how effective Canuel member work and your community how can you network how could you or he will she nice tits so yes nope no thanks Pam yeah and I mean we are obliged to look at both you know fear and effective and I think you know that the case has been pretty strongly made on both sides of the of the hill Yanni I 'm just to correct something thank you for your submission the first is it 's my understanding that since the amalgamation there 's a West minute council collected from a little darker but here is never from the echo are everywhere so the argument that you make about some havin they 're havin an elected councillor for the entire areas you can make for that little some milk theory as well and that 's the echo my rear it from never head council or elected from dear component because of the population but we 've worked very closely with little to manage so what excites me so what I 'm trying to understand is what 's the rationale for little tone being separate sender than the wrist of Christchurch City because that 's what I can 't_''_557.29 I 'm to be seen as an isolated community and to have a different layer of representation well Littleton is part of us lyttelton harbour as part of us you know we think about littleton happen because it 's another harbour part of being spun Angela I suppose as well how we think about it but if if you 're thinking about Sumner some of the people don 't come back this way they don 't understand about the port they don 't understand about the coastal issues like with the whole country the rural issues littleton is more likely to have someone that will have a bit of a feel for that and and an understanding of what that what those sort of issues are right okay so that 's based on the historic boundary effects but the Volquez well no it 's not the historic boundary i think it 's the natural boundary of things financially that 's what it 's like could you merge the community boards and tough and 21 a karate littleton maybe as a last resort be very difficult i might be dead i might and the pressures of andrew 's caught on and the way he operates it would be an incredible pressure and staff wise our staff have worked littleton Mount Herbert and it is very difficult and challenging too so my second question was if the council and we 've had a number of snow to say we 'll just leave begs minutes earth as a single Ward if we went with that proposal would you support us increasing the urban wards so that the deviation wasn 't as great which would probably have a greater chance of success in terms of arguing that in terms that fair and effective pasa minus temper scene so if we reduce the deviation in the urban area recognizing the peninsula cipro is that something you would support cause it sounds right to me I can 't hear them I don 't think there are any issues with that you 're saying that the rest of Christchurch would have would look at it having it mate may have a higher deviation of what so having small awards then currently exists now maybe currently in a proposal is kept as it as it was I had I mean I 'm passionate about the furniture being kept together because it is a definite identity it sticks out of a Canterbury Plains it 's totally different so the urban area it 's about communities working together around communities of interest and making sure that they are working together to but they are not disjointed but I don 't want you to be leading to saying that an issue honestly believe that the people of Christchurch would be satisfied with an increase a number of councillors after I don 't what it 's 18 when I 'm here and I think that 's where we were being being taken and I think that it 's always a challenge because it may sound like it 's it 's an easy balancing act but actually it isn 't because the issues as you say on one side of the hill quite different than they are over and the city side and I think the city 's reaction to and significant increase in the number of councillors which of course they have to pay one Andrew thank you and thanks Pam for the presentation this morning the question was just raised what would your view of a banks peninsula community board be rather than the a Corot why real were a little to mount her arrangements that we currently have and you already mentioned travel times as possibly a disincentive for for you to stand as part of that board let alone anybody else what other considerations do you think there could be or should be if we were looking at one community board for banks peninsula if we kept banks peninsula together as it is as one ward what do you think the advantages or disadvantages of that banks peninsula community board might be all depends on who brings it all together and how its brought together the people that are involved and how they can get on I mean it naturally in any situation you have to make the situation work but I think it mean perhaps it may be that we need to see the use of more of new technology that will allow us perhaps to stay home and not to make it work I don 't know what are other opportunities there might be to do but we need to make sure that we 've got people that are that are happy to work together and able to make good decisions wise decisions on behalf of both sides of the hill and of course I have got it because I 'm gonna part of the zone committee sad thanks Mensch Conservation Trust I 'm part of a whole lot of organizations that can do it but moving forward it maybe not be so easy need to make sure that we can speak on behalf of or work with both sides of the effect happiness not preferable but no maybe do I dare say it that it may be something we have to make work no all right any other nope that 's all good thank you very much pain much appreciated and obviously you know that I ask a question I see my times not up up there yeah um we 've lost the local government Commission when was that act reviewed why is there no opportunity to have we 're up to or have you had a discussion no all which 2013 was the extra was additional calls Potter and there were very few submissions to a wee part of it did we did we become involved in this I don 't notice before my time yes I am where do we put as Yoko I can check that with a councilperson submission right to it so it 's obvious that next time we need to be having a bit of a nun port or looking at it more closely to see what I 'd actually see is and what it actually means for us it 's all that I think that the peps time just let me just put a little fly in the ointment so to speak which is that if you look at the direction that the country 's going on it 's amalgamations so i don 't know that i don 't i don 't know that it 's going to be opened up for a for a further review any time soon and there is no appetite down here for further amalgamations we whether the amalgamation with well that the original decision to separate Littleton from the city whether that was the right decision and then ultimately whether banks peninsula council amalgamated with the right council or whether it should have been split there 's been discussion around all of these issues over the last year it 's come to strew a Corral through to Christchurch so I still see that we 're a strong link with Christ Church that 's where I 'm angry and I also know that a lot of the a lot of the people that live on archaria are also residents of Christchurch City who have a holiday home Anna Caruso I know the connection very strongly but in order to drive to to that part of the constituency if I go round through tai tapu I go through the Selwyn District Council to get there so there isn 't a there isn 't a land link on that side that with with the two parts of our city and its it just seems to me that the challenges that face a smaller rural area are in common centres and that we 're right up against that challenge by having this very conversation anyway so thank you very much for for that but as I say the the the distance and the points of connection they are what is driving a lot of the a lot of this review so thank you very much for your contribution so could i invite _"

    "text": "repeat it again for the for the for the month so yeah just so people are with it and it 's kind of record it certain people did you click come interest and mystery from right our connection with service of the Japanese community i just want to mention the flavor David bowl of smut seemed an empress award yes and the end it just just will be good for the pizza Muir 's office to note that I would certainly recommend that we have a special tool Thank You ceremony today yeah it 's perfectly for many years to the crochet committee or what why don 't noted but I 'm just year we did I just wonder whether we could have a sort of a recognition here and you know it 's sort of one of the council meetings get them to come to a council meeting or some onion yeah okay thank you maybe around morning tee times so it can present them or something very good alright so now we come to the receipt of the audit report and it 's do we you 've come good to go okay right we 're just dealing what the last metem measure on the agenda which is the crush City Council annual report including obviously the audit report you 're in town yeah and Julian could you come and join us as well thank you right but where do you want to start with us I 'll just give a great introduction and then there 's any questions were happy to okay thank you thank you madam a thank you and we 're very pleased today to be able to present the annual report to football approval the operating result for the year was a small deficit of 23 million which after adjusting for capital revenues resulted in a surplus of 307 million and just to give you some background as to what the capital revenues were they were things such as NZTA subsidies reimbursement from Sarah for costs relating to the earthquake and the special earthquake levy that is collected from ratepayers we then put through the revaluation which was for the wastewater and roading assets and force ECHL subsidiaries and that has resulted in a final important to emphasize that this is a non-cash result it 's not because we 've overrated ratepayers as i said the operating result was a 23 million dollar deficit University of it as are the capital revenues which you are required to account for or accounting entries which come in as revenue within your hands our balance sheet remains strong and were in a strong position to deliver on our financial and infrastructure strategies we have received the accounting opinion from audit New Zealand and copies have been circulated to you all and the opinion is modified as it was last year largely unchanged from last year the disappointment for us this year was that despite revaluing the wastewater and roading assets we were unable to quantify the financial impact of the earthquake damage to a level with metal standard and you standards so that is still modified for that reason also there 's still uncertainty around our insurance receivables and obviously a good reason for not disclosing them and finally the component of the skirt work in progress audit have quite rightly pointed out that that included within it know what 's there until it arrives we 're unable to separate it out so we feel we did make some progress as years as better than last year but unfortunately not good enough and I would like to thank Julian and it 's team very much it has been another very hard auditor not like to thank you sincerely Julian for your help and of course Patricia and her team who worked all hours to produce the report and as I said we 're very happy to answer any questions that anyone they have thank you do you want to add anything Julian I mean that 's um I mean I want to reiterate what what Diana said you know you guys have worked extraordinarily hard yet again I know that our our accounts are extraordinarily challenging for a whole lot of reasons as Dan 's are already highlighted but we are very grateful and know that you know i mean it is disappointing on one level but it has to be that way because of the circumstances yeah thnkx millimeter there they are they are improvements all the year 's or the desert 2014 it we were able to clear the water supply assets and this year we clear the land and buildings and although it could not clear roading stormwater sssss we we are willing to help counsel get to a point where we can remove those qualifications and then my role involved with counselors agreement bringing in our specialist engineer to help counsel validate the clear roadmap to how the evaluation issues to be resolved so i have discussed that management they 're supportive i want to take it a bit further that 's clearing it with the opponent risk and management risk management committee hmm so if it may or may not expedite the next time in which we are able to clear those qualifications but at least you 're trying something different so so I think that 's just really one of one to say about they already report happy to take questions thank you thank you are there any questions Yanni you think Thank You Jay um I was just I was kind of interested in the why it 's so difficult for depreciation I mean skirt projects are pretty well defined we know the standards they 've been sorted through government what what standard that building to what why is it so difficult for us to actually have understand okay is this is because the accounting standards require completed assets to be transferred from your capital work in pro progress account to your to your real asset account so that the council can immediately begin providing depreciation that has not been possible because as as Linus mentioned the capital work in progress balance is a big lump sum of here and four million dollars so there 's no work done or possible to be done at balanced 82 auntie 's out the bit that relates to the genuine capital work in progress for which depreciation need not be provided the completed asset portion on which the precision has got to be provided but you have not got that information to calculate that and lastly the there is a proportion of expenditure captured we didn 't kept the work in progress that relates to operation expenditure that got to be flush out to so is there anything that we can do aside from you I find it extremely well in New Zealand bringing in a special engineer in value infrastructure when we 've got the most amount of money being spent through in a lion and the most amount of focus on temperatures will move over sorry i passed as you clarified that the bringing in the engineers in relation to your roading SS and your storm water assets where the the asset condition information is incomplete in fact insufficient inadequate due to the extent of damage to do to those assets so until such time you are able to determine precisely as a condition you are not in a position to quantify what might be the amount of damage and booked the the impairment charge yes the problem hasn 't already done that haven 't we just spend a fortune on skirt doing yeah is this the Oscar lesson so it 's AI grija we do know we know the condition and the value of the skirt assets it 's the condition of the remaining network for the rest of the city a horizontal infrastructure repair program that was outstanding that we did we don 't know off the top of my head I can 't recall but on some networks it 's actually quite a skirts only dealing with this very small proportion i 'm a total this is the impact of the earthquake on the stuff that 's not obviously damaged but it might actually impact the remaining useful life of that as it we getting an understanding of what that an acid it may would normally have an 80-year life what does after the impact of the earthquakes what impact has that had on an 80-year life that 's the next step that we 're trying that we need to get to is to say for things that aren 't obviously earthquake damage don 't need to be replaced immediately when all they need to be replaced in 18 years as they were typically or is it now 15 20 30 those are the Christians that are being asked that we need to have to look into okay so the issue for us is maybe one that work is 500 million is that I 've done on down well no but that the key issue is the timetable so I mean it 's not like a billion dollars needs to be spent next year might be a billion dollars over 30 years 40 years 50 years or 75 years I mean I might be five years loss of life it 's a pointer sisters it is a valuation oisin yes that impacts on a balance shade because we need to depreciate for the life of those essays yes and if we 're not depreciating then we are appreciate wasn 't really providing enough and yeah and that is the question we need to ask an answer so so in terms of us go that 's why I 'm forgetting and answer that question sorry come again at the time frame for getting an answer to that question that that is in the hands of counsel not us really the until like I said until you 're able to determine accurately the as a condition you 're not able really to determine might be the remaining useful life example that hmm what about stuff do we have a kind of target yes our target was last June which was disappointing um so we are now reassessing it we think roading may be one of the most easy of the three to resolve so we 'll work with that but the offer that Julian has made for our engineers to work with his engineer I think will help us a lot because quite often it was a matter of us knowing what we needed to provide that would help the auditors form an opinion so it 's not just a matter of shoveling more information at them it 's a matter of providing stuff that 's specialized that will help them and by working with order new zealand 's engineer I think we 'll be able to actually zero in better on what specifically needs to be done in the valuation that was done last year was there 's nothing wrong with the valuation and since it wasn 't the valuer it was simply the fact that most of the assets are underground and it 's very hard to work out number of years by testing and sampling and that has been done but what perhaps wasn 't done was pulling all that together to form an opinion and that 's I think the work we need to do this year so we will be working this year if we can get rid of roading and a wing get rid of waste water that would actually be quite a major thing that would leave only storm water and we won 't look to value storm water assets this year because our engineers tell us they 're still not comfortable with the condition so they themselves don 't know but on its own storm water is not a huge I think five percent of our total network alright um Andrew I no no no no no I 'm just having a challenging day um referring to page and 212 paragraph 31.4 I note that in the second column of text plan we 've got a note the council as Jones enchanter donated directors fees to the mayor 's welfare fund those are CDC sorry some cct directors fees I 'm aware that of directors of CDC would do the same thing so certainly it was my intention that my directors fees as director CDC would go to them as welfare fund what 's the status of those funds and why are they not appearing in the same way as the Chen and Jones ones we contacted those entities that and ask them what they had paid to the particular councillors CDC said they had not paid anything directly so that 's why the CDC fans aren 't showing and discs am CDC directors fees aunt Shalini cct had made the payments directly to the counselors and they had been been on paid by those counselors to them is Welfare Fund um I am I haven 't_''_899.39 confirmed yet if CDC have made the payment to the news welfare fund so it may be those funds are still sitting with web CDC and they are going to make a payment I will be following analysis all right great and then just walk through the question in that forum there 's a further figure of twenty five thousand four hundred and twenty seven dollars as I understand that the the payment of 2547 isn 't subject to the resolution the agreement of counselors that they would be paid to them as well be fun you know this from the joint it 's from the counselor of the counselors appointment to the transport GM now there had been some informal discussion about a report coming to counsel to resolve a number of issues around that original resolution on the way that it 's been applied or already are you able to give an update on where this and i did i 'm not there all right i think i 've got on hard drives like yeah yes don 't yeah thank you yeah just in terms of this qualified opinion and what beyond the things that you 've outlined in terms of the assets that you 've just outlined it works and drainage and things what else would need to happen for the council not to have qualified alert there are basically three matters my take is that the once the valuations are clear in other words evaluations are complying with the financial reporting standards out there will still be another six months for the skirt work to be analyzed so you 're really looking at color quite some distance out to get those qualifications our way that 's my my estimate there will still be what to get them out the way there was there will be the estimated elapsed time for the qualifications to be completely removed from the old report the estimated lips time being to two years two years so if you if you look at the time table that we all know skirts will program will finish in December 2016 yep and knowing what we know based on the history so far with councils ability to get information from skirt to analyze out the work in progress Bevin 's allow it says six months to get that information and book it and then allow the your relievers to do a decent job and in the same time getting the essay condition information already for for your value it really was to work on so that 's my estimate so in terms of your decision to qualify the report it 's only thing for the three thing insurance of course yes a generation of property plant and equipment to the City Council was unable to accurately classify the capital we can progress balance and we were unable to obtain sufficient audit evidence over carrying value of insurance receivables recognizing the financial statements are the three that is correct yes so in relation to the second one what do you want to see in order to get rid of your qualifications neither sickness let 's let us show you about the keplerian progress appreciation and valuation after that kept know the skilled work in progress yes just skip work in progress yes yeah oh it does yeah so there 's not not transferred no you you 've got to push skirt that 's test my answer you 've got to pressure skirt yes yeah they have they have improved haven 't they yes but at what rate of them get it was worth a slightly classier of a very low baby they have improved in that last year there was some very old work there yeah there was a very slow very balance is dropped and the and the average life is drop the work there is three months on average old which is not a bad record for passing it through but the problem is still within that 804 there is there is a large component of completed assets that we we have no visibility of and therefore we are unable to do anything I mean for things to be perfect we would be looking for skirt to transfer finishing jobs to us as soon as they finished and whereas they do it by sector or something XO doesn 't program yet so in practical terms is there anything that stops them completing like transferring the completed job to us given that they know what they 've done they 've planned out their entire work program they know what they 're going to do until the end of their time what would it stop them actually transferring kind of the week later on completion even I think the way they have their system set up i think is the form and the order process is under orders WT partnership on disappear understand it i 'm sorry to be so dense yeah well i have the same problem but isn 't this something that we could do to fix all that we did try and we did talk you senior skirt people and as i said they have made some improvements it 's probably worth having another one to see if we can move anything further because we did point out to them there was a major mmm issue because presumably is having an impact on our pets Jane could help us out I think that the Audit Committee will have seen a marked increase in the transfer of the skirt work that has been noticeable I think you need one of our engineers maybe Dave to explain exactly why it 's not as simple as just passing it over because we 'll get the liability with there 's actually a role for counsel to to sign on the line that they 're happy to receive it once it comes to us we can 't hold them to account for anything what 's not working so having said all of that was to say I 'm completely still not okay about it I really like us to just take this a bit further if we may at the program amazing from the paperback that would be really nice thanks time that 's all teams and I 'd like to know and thought that the pros and cons will be back early or not a slight we 're countering issues what the what the issues are fortunately does it just waited to see if we could get a report from the horizontal and destruction chasm is great you hear maybe what report directly to council rep becomes very obvious ITA audition rounds again with business ownership on the insurance which I don 't quite still understand so work in progress isn 't insured that we 've ensured up until the time that 's insured up in a good place good handed over to us know once they 've completed the job they 're their own insurance cover CSIS ya say and I mean our underground insurance we don 't Al 's pics I 'll fix it up once we take title but so surance program is kept anyway so we NT honestly we 're gonna have her a comprehensive report on all of the issues relating to you know we were up to the you know the whole lot the whole nine yards so we have a whole nine yards actually in Cape treatment in years if other people got questions for Julian I just wanted to change one thing on the and the report itself which is just the vision statement at the beginning because I was at the audit and risk meeting when we considered this and I simply said because we wanted to get rid of that dreadful phrase boutique city that to take the phrase from the government 's document and that 's been taken literally and so it now doesn 't read like a vision statement so if it could just be changed to that christ church remains a place where anything as possible a place that is open to new ideas new people in new ways of doing things and that way we pick up the essence of it but we don 't have a phrase that some we have a vision for it is that all right yes great was there anything else that people want to raise a gleaming yep or just on the only opinion something emerged in two weeks ago they 're having a modified audit report and I have been curious over any implications for no credit ratings etc so it says there are no direct consequences but any indirect consequences the you know nobody 's think so i think we we 've made sure that that our credit rating and banks understand where they are that they have they understand that audit have confidence in our underlying processes that 's simply the value of the assets so now i don 't think there 's any in do it Ellie can I just ask about the side completing a step cousin page and this page we when you 're looking at a vision you 're looking into the future and yet the word in there sounds of Fame is here so we 've seen Christchurch remains a place where anything is possible we 've just all you 've just changed I 've is that it remains a place that as these things yeah we can we can put crashes afraid yeah yeah Rogers nothing okay because Vicki is a recorder on Facebook of all things that happen at the meetings and in fact i received a complaint that I was absent from the last meeting which means that there weren 't regular updates that have been through on facebook because she was cheering the meeting so I just want you to know that people do take notice of it so it will read now christchurch as a place where anything is possible right great so i will now would someone I thought we we have a mover and a seconder for that I thought yeah ref and then Jamie had moved and seconded this so i will put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried and I think that as it I think we 've done on dust oh sorry we 're good now got to move that we accept the report as a whole and that will also be moved by ref and all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried i think i have to sign a letter now don 't accept all eyes in them or if I already done that I 'd sorry some advice from Giuliana so we have to accept his report and then moves that the annual report was his report for you doctor oh okay sorry go back I 'm not saying it go back to week it said that notes that it will receive a modified audit report on the basis that da-da-da-da-da has reviewed has reviewed the letter of representation approves the annual report and recommends it for adoption so somewhere in there do we need to say that that we 've reviewed the received the under pendant auditor 's report under the local government act the DNA report got to be adopted with the auditors repair right so I think if you clarify that in the resolution I no fully in a composite ACT ok so maybe one point to point for that said or shall we put IM approves the annual report with the inclusion of the jun 2015 and recommends that for adoptions well actually and adopt such because we 've approved their annual report with the inclusion no actually what we need to do is just change the word approves to adopt and take out the recommendation because what we 've got us the we 've got the committee 's recommendation but we haven 't actually turned to done to what the council 's decide the council was deciding now and we don 't need subject to the receipt of the audit report at the top because we 've got hurt so take our subject there has reviewed the draft it 's because this is that this hasn 't been turned into a council resolution that 's the trouble so lemme app apps have you there if it would be a lot clearer if you have a resolution first and foremost to approve the annual report yeah adoption then we receive the auditor 's report and then you adopt the in rapport with the auditor 's report and angling perfectly fine alright so so I quite like some of the detail that some one point we have you 're saying receive the draft 2015 annual report no the first the first step is to approve the n.o report fake action then you receive the auditor 's report okay and lastly adopt the inner report with the auditor 's report okay heads-up that the council approves the end the 2015 annual report no no we 've got that the council at the top so you just put approves the 2015 annual report yeah you need to take out one point yeah that 's right so just turn that into approves well you can just delete sorry I know for adoption full stop take out the rest of it we don 't need to have the we don 't with the council doesn 't need to review the statement of compliance for adoption no that 's already done so take out one point to point to and we don 't need to do the next one either and then so the next one is receives the order report audit report do we want to have anything in there about the nature of the qualified opinion or just

for ya is that right that 's right yeah it 's the annual report that 's what we need the auditor for so 24 the assault on the pier restaurant Lisa 's time on to new tomb now I 'm going to get ref because you cheered the strategy and Finance Committee meeting I wasn 't there to introduce this and I presume you 'd like to move it yeah I 'll move it and Jamie or second dirt right okay and this came to the committee directly because staff were concerned that they had an inconsistent policy on granting lease assignments and extensions what run on their lease they 've been trying to sell the business for a number of years and haven 't_''_123.7 been able to find a buyer and they found a buyer and the buyer would naturally like to have the lease assigned as part of the sales process but also have an extension to the current lease commercially that makes a lot of sense and that 's obviously up to the landlord which is us we don 't have a very clear policy on this generally we prefer leases to run to their end and then we put it out for public tender but there are several examples of where we have extended at least before expiry and start have asked for some guidance I 've asked them to come back with a new policy which provides consistency and guidance that will come to the next strategy of finance meeting so prior to that obviously we 've got to make a decision on this the committee discussed the pros and cons of extending the lease and the lease assignment and found in favor of doing that the current tenant wants to get in looks excited and I think we felt that it provides certainty to the community and that 's quite important at this time saves councils the costs of having to go out for a new tender in two years time and actually there was nobody else who had any interest in taking over the business some felt there was an issues around the process that it wasn 't enough I guess Public Engagement those who found in favor of it thought actually there was a very thorough sales process and that qualified for the public piece of that so we voted to approve that the council could progress with the buyer to work out the terms of a new lease which would obviously be on current policing practices and obviously current market values for that Lee so we 've left that for staff to and get on with so that 's where we ended up and you 've our staff to come back with a specific policy direction to assist them and future situations yeah because of the inconsistency of the decision making yes and general discussions with suggest that actually will probably come back with a policy which will allow for some flexibility as you get close to the the end of the lease but we just need some clarity for staff so that they know exactly what they 're supposed to be doing yeah now look I 'd like to take the two ward councillors first if I may and then I 'll come to you Pauline so Glenn David over questions yeah or just commentary or yeah because I mean I don 't know I think what a lot of questions have been asked and answered absolutely yeah I do see the other cases that have been made and put through council leases and various awards I cannot see a reason why not we would proceed with this that sovereign appearance considered one of the shining lights in New Brighton economically socially in fact this is more than extending a lease in my view this is actually answering a you know serving the ends of local government over the four well-beings it 's not just a commercial decision that wider than that so I encourage 'm Angie obviously we do need to have a policy that does have some flexibility yeah Dave thank you yes likewise I 'm very supportive of this recommendation it 's an unusual situation there council finds itself in periodically with these sorts of leases where there 's a short-term lease flipped a buyer comes along and naturally wants more than just a couple of years as left on the lease so I think it 's been well elucidated this morning that we 've had a number of other instances where this has occurred and I think in the case of commercial activity in New Brighton this is one success story of a complex that 's worked very well it 's a well patronized and well-loved venue and New Brighton and I think for us to go through a a procurement process on this would really just be another slap in the face for the eastern suburbs community and I think it makes absolute sense to go ahead and as the committee have recommended Pauline and then entry oh well I was just going to ask at least of it do is it a number of years and I know he has the current owner has tried to sell it over the last couple of years hobbies that yes because to me if that 's the case then we sort of we have satisfied the principles of giving opportunity to others and respect of the public asset they 've had an opportunity people had an opportunity to put photos of the market once Pauline and I didn 't sell but I 've managed to get a buyer yesterday obviously it 's conditional to us extending the legs and so to me I think that it 's given the opportunity for others to come in and have a go as a public asset which is what we we like to try and provide in our procurement so I 'm quite happy with the recommendation yeah Andrew yeah I totally understand the commercial considerations here I mean as someone who has had experience both as a commercial landlord and as a commercial tenant I 'm very familiar with the way that the assignment of these leases works and the way that the extensions in these sort of situations as well I 'm also very aware first hand at the way that a value of business can diminish when at least comes to his end and therefore there 's insecurity for a new buyer over what 's going to happen when that lease ends which inevitably has got an implication for the value of the business certainly also very aware of commercial consideration of looking after our own tenant in one of our buildings and the reputational risk I guess to counsel of the way that we conduct our business of leasing these facilities to to tenants they 're all the sort of things I would say if we were a commercial board and I almost certainly would be happy to grant both the assignment and the new lease if we were a commercial board on that basis but the reality remains that we 're not a commercial board and there 's a public policy consideration comes into play here as well now we need to make sure and that 's the reason why we have a procurement policy that we get good outcomes facility adds value to the community from a social aspect and that we get the best outcome for ratepayers as well as communities as well so at the committing I certainly took a very strong stance that the public policy and the policy that we have around the way that we deal with these assets should be the thing that we were absolutely wedded to and we should let that take precedence over the the commercial needs in this case of the the land of the the current tenants and the the future talent so the assignments of the league 's I didn 't have a problem with it was the extension of the lease or the granting of the new term but I did have a problem with and I would make the point here as well that going out for a commercial sale and purchase process of a business is quite different than going through a procurement process to initiate a new lease however we 've had the benefit of input today from the two ward councillors and we 've also had the benefits over night of the in relation to this specific case and I 'm happy to defer to the wishes of the ward councillors they knew they know New Brighton far better than I do and if the right outcome for new brighton is that we not only assign this lease but we also grant that new lease then I 'm happy in this case for that to occur but realizing that once again we 're making an exception to a policy and one where there are a number of recent exceptions that have been made quite high profile extensions and where there are some others where we haven 't made the same extension so we 're looking at some real inconsistencies here and that 's the reason that I 'm very pleased to hear that we will review this policy in the near future so that we can then get some consistency in this space if we 've got a policy that we 're consistently making exceptions to then that consider that suggests that we need to to consider how appropriate that policy actually is so despite I spoke strongly against this at the I 'm happy to do what I 'm told is the best for New Brighton and let this proceed but really only in the context of knowing that we 've got that policy review coming up Johnny thank you so I just want to be clear that what we 're proposing is not just one inconsistency this is not like the other ones that have been done in the past and here 's why because it 's not just one dealing unilaterally with the assignee and extending the lease it 's taking away this report going to the local community board it 's delegating away from council and community board something off on the lease and as not going through that procurement policy so there 's actually three inconsistencies work this report where a council has talked about giving more to community boards encouraging community boards to be involved and we heard the comment that if we don 't agree to this it 's a slap in the face to the community actually I think it 's not fair to the local community board to simply deviate from the standard all of those other ones as I understand it win through community boards in fact just recently we were discussing the halls will the new hosel library cafe and that report had come through the community board with recommendations to us as the council 's so actually it 's not a minor thing here actually it 's quite I think symbolic of whether we trust community boards too involved in these processes and if we do then we should actually allow them to participate not exclude them from that I think there 's interesting things for example we haven 't done an updated valuation so the last radiation was done over two years ago two and a half years ago so I kind of had a question of staff of when we 're doing the evaluation I don 't know where the stuff can can answer that today there 's a number of questions and here which staff have actually put on and I know some of the other problems with head in the past with these hospitality operations has been the suitability of the operators and in people I got a bit of comment on that and here in 20 silent sorry I 'm here last part um well just in terms of from an operator that 's got a lot of possibility experience to an operator that has meal and what the risks are for us based on I guess previous experience either we 've had with other places ok well the assignee has poured a pretty solid business plan they 're essentially looking to retain the current arrangement with a few improvements just on your comment regarding the reeds in New least it would be a valuation sort so those terms you need to be defined but we aren 't recommending a new lease so the staff here is not a new lace but the committee 's here is to extend the device yep so I 'm presuming in the nature of the conversation that will probably carry the committee recommendation i 'll be carried yeah so as part of that process will you get a new valuation yes and that could quite considerably change just as Matt Reis right so what I guess what I 'm or a business yeah but but us not not knowing what the outgoings would be in terms of the ring we haven 't been dirty little racist surely the staff have gone through all this and we 've had if we 've had a report from the staff over there negotiations I don 't think we should be this is what I tried to go straight to the debate because the issues had been well canvass the questions have been asked and answered it 's been through a committee process but I wasn 't_''_898.98 at the committee process from other people a perfectly valid question was asked which was which which I didn 't give people an opportunity to ask and it wasn 't us was was there going to be a new valuation done we 've had the answer yes so if we could come to a conclusion and your contribution so what emerged as minimizing the roster to us as a council if the committee recommendation goes here I can remind you what happened at the committee there were comments made around the advice that we had coming was talking about the counselors not the star hey hey hey hey hey excuse me excuse me I wasn 't_''_938.19 at the meeting but I have had reported to me certain elements of the meeting we do not need to traverse behaviour here that are unacceptable around a council tova table now just carry on come to a conclusion so what I 'm trying to understand like but what my concern is right is that if you assign this lace and the sale goes ahead and yet the the market valuation that we do comes up with quite a different rent structure then the person that 's acquired the business at the price that they 've acquired a dinners faced with and of uncertainty around being able to meet those whatever those rebels might be so how do we how do we mitigate that from a risk point of view because we do have cases where we 've got people that are in some of our facilities who who are behind in the orenco is struggling because for whatever reason and so to me that 's a real risk yeah of terms with the assignee for the new lease before their business transaction takes place yeah so they would know exactly what they 're getting into before they purchase the business all right thank you so um Jamie and then Paul yeah well I think it 's been well traversed and I 'm glad to hear the councillors both in the water yet see the value in this III think the reality is you know not one disagreeing with what yannis same but the crux of this as do we crash a sale for a really good business to a really good new owner or do we just let them get on with their lives you know it 's quite quite significant for them I think looks done that sectional job on this I genuine before he was done actually at council and work for a commercial property company we 're very lucky to heaven but i think what hamstrings us is that we we don 't have a policy around this and i 'm not envious of staff trying to come up with them because i don 't know at the committee but the nature of business and properly is that it is a dynamic environment and the old adage of you don 't know what you don 't know could not be more true to this industry because stuff just crops up and at the end of the day the value of this business is actually in the lease is closing the name it 's called soul from the pier so if they 're not on the pier they don 't have a business you can 't get a better part of half a million dollars for a couple of cans of soda and a deep fryer so they they do need to actually have this business here this happens all the time in all honesty and the only reason that we had the rig that we did is because we are slightly hamstrung by this policy so I think it 's a good opportunity for counselors to do actually what our job is is to come in and bring a human and commercial element to it and try and pass some judgment that 's in the best better place and I think having an intelligent conversation with our tenants and to say of course will be a good landlord of course we 'll come to the party you have run your business very well you 've contributed well to New Brighton you 've had a change of circumstances you 're looking at selling your business we don 't want to stand in the way of that is a great new operator that 's coming in and in continuing your good work and we only want to enable there you know strong update from saying i 'm i 'm here on Counsell trying to find ways that things can help and not find ways that they can 't and I think this is just this is pragmatic it 's logical it 's common sense and i think it 's combining a good community outcome actually with a pragmatic and sensible commercial outcome as well so very supportive of the committee recommendation Paul look I already glad that this is being dealt with today and the way it 's been done with and the strong opposition from both sides number of leases we 've seen commercial or otherwise coming to the council and the inconsistencies they actually show I 'm really pleased that this has brought it to a head where we can su now look at the policy and get it sorted at once and for all so we actually can go forward in a consistent manner however I am taking the local councillors points of view and I want to support the recommendation but only again like councillor Turner and like the fact we are going to get a consistent policy and from here on in we can actually apply it that consistently amor y the lease is going forward all right i will put the motion oh we 've we 've got a moved and seconded all those in favor say aye those opposed say no the pose and that 's carried thank you so I think that 's all _"

clean Mike invaded Nick thank you you know what if their staff to come up just so with you have any more may hell yeah but in case any questions arise yeah Jeff Robert O 'Connor Lewiston and Joanne Walton exhaust the panel so you 'll see the information there that obviously there 's a lot of history involved with this as I 've just said this really is more a process question where the panel report is asking the council to start again due to the original narrow wording which did not permit projections and two objections we received in beginning this process there are many issues there many layers as far as the Hutt scope that proposal there is to actually put them on a secure legal footing and once we go down the path of a management plan that could well throw up with different time frame over that at least for instance coming out a lot more I could say there but you know I really have to hope that you 've read the report there 's a lot of history how this matter has really gone from counsel to counsel to counsel and that we 've inherited it and have to try and find a way forward and obviously we want us to I think we need to act reasonably there are you know there 's certain attachment to the land then obviously some legal considerations public-private the beta citroen so but these are the experts yeah Paul and then Andrew that 's what else made some decisions around Taylor 's mistake folder by Emily gardens and I just want to make sure that with those decisions were going to be do we have to be consistent with the way we treat this here and white of those decisions for tivo their endless private lake mary gardeners corporate consistency would be desirable but each individual reserve should we looked at individually it 's my reading us that the chalice mistake was more of a situation of legal road this is actually a parcel knowledge of the other issues that would be my initial formation yeah Andrew thank you my immediate concern with this probably relates most to paragraph 2.4 the sergeant 15 the leases be granted to the bus folders for a period of up to five years with no right of renewal now given that the hearings panel is to be reconvened in the process is essentially to start again if I was one of the hut owners I would be concerned by the content of paragraph 2.5 clearly the things that the panel will be considering once reconvened a matter or so fun historic and heritage value and the current use of that land alongside any cultural considerations and any other matters what it would be wrong to suggest anything about that hearings panel because that 's a massacre panel but in terms of the effect of the outcome of the the hearings on the content of 2.5 the five-year non-renewable legs is it possible that that could then be quite different as a result of the deliberations an outcome of the here expand it 's my understanding old defer to without wanting to second guess it 's always not wise the second gifts but that could well change coming out of the measurement plan process okay council that because of learning Livingston 's correct as i understand at the hearings panel intended that the classification the dual classification was was on on an interim basis so that a time could be taken to complete a full reserves act management plan that reserves act management plan would produce the permanent solution and so that Lisa 's granted and the interim would be for a short period there 's a second aspect to the period of of the lease also in that the reserves act only permits leases of up to five years for these types of the parcels of land so those two reasons why that that for that short period of time was was was recorded therefore the lease terms so I 'm assuming that we 're expecting this matter to the resolve permanently with in that five-year period exact yet great so if I was to take the attitude but what we 're dealing with today is a matter with when the final recommendation of the hearing comes back that would be a good approach yeah great thank you so except for Knight d4 do we really need that was no why from you all in there was just to make clear that is a short term process and a long term solution will will emerge from the reserves management- Management Plan process it 's just to make it clear that 's a message isn 't it going out there these people have been there for generations yea though the five years is a short time to do this was this was a particular desire of one one of the members of the hearings panels it short period be given and the de permanent solution be dealt with through the management claim process later that the permanent solution may well offer a longer form of tenure although as I alluded to in my my answer to councillor Turner the reserves it will only ever allow us to grant five year leases yes I 'm so pleased to accept this even even even the permanent solution which may allow batches level down we will only ever be able to grant five year leases just have to be there on earth does they have to be there is there a requirement of the ex that you have to be that explicit in heaven brackets with no right I think I think it 's there for information to make it clear that batch owners are not going to get 50 year leases yes but it doesn 't mean that they won 't get a Russia from you then they weren 't the so that doesn 't mean they won 't be able to remove the least should the management the hearings Canada side you but we 're delegating authority to the property consultancy manager to grant visas to the hut holders through a period of up to five years with no right of renewal so what we 're delegating to the council property consultancy manager is just this ability so I mean oh it 's just making it clear that that that person can 't_''_434.49 put on a right of renewal that it 's another process to go through I thinkers that if the hearings panel came to the view that perhaps would be all right for them to stay on for another five or team or whatever who knows it would have but that bad it stop them from doing it because they have not had to come back anyway because this is onia and terim steer okay all right this is just what 's the deed to Lhasa to license to occupies that directive is actually expired so this puts them on illegal this this will put this water just will put on an interim basis the batches on illegal their occupancy on a legal basis which they don 't have a demand here illegally can I just preps add that under the current licenses they have an expectation to take their tenancy out till 2020 so by actually going through this process if we do and then issued leases as we 're allowed to do under the reserves act for a period of five years we 're giving them what they would have currently all right okay i 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye as a place they know it 's carried awesome _"

    "text": "seems eminently sensible to get rid of a piece of redundant legislation right do people have any questions that they want to ask of Judah Andrew yeah this is a question for Judah there 's more of a process question I 'm not aware of this having come through the submissions panel is is that the case or did I miss that some way now isn 't kind of submissions panel I think the delegations the submissions panel sees that things go to the panelist is not time to go to the council and although it was yet a bit of a squeeze to skip this into the council system we consider there was enough time to give it to the council before the submissions are due date if there 's any changes or message that the council want addressed i guess in the submission or change a thing my suggestion is that the council with them further those from today to the submissions panel to asana offer final submission but that 's why i didn 't go the solutions panel yeah great now thanks for that clarification so did 'm picky um things are still supposed to go the submissions panel but then they 're supposed to be reported back to Council no honey there isn 't correct that isn 't what the delegation sees but leaving all that aside as we want to change the delegation than then there 's just one question I had which I 'm you 've talked about a number of things around proposes to Sparkle and portable to polls just on one through seven just wonder whether we 've gone far enough in terms of issue requirements on the retailers I personally wondered whether we should have a requirement that they have to actually register the address of the spa or the swim pool um is that possible how you look at page 137 yeah that 's the submission from 2013 submission of the post submission signing off on today 's pages 1 for 7 to 11 time five for the pistol unsatisfied one more simple one by far is this yeah so just is there anything in here that just would require the retailer to it actually or someone selling secondhand to we currently work out whose phone call but you know don 't maybe we take aerial photos but it does I just mean to me that it would make it a lot easier for us to have our ongoing system of a large bullet point on recently the the amendments to the bill don 't making your acquaintance relation to see contained sales of holes good given that spa holes I mean the council is not going after own skates baffles or hot tubs or portable poles the second-hand sale of those holes hips as it is it get council wants to but if we don 't have to inspect them why do we want to register them why don 't we why do we want any notification if we don 't inspect them I mean this seems to me to be a sensible so a number of set on a number of these and so often there 's issues around building consent being approved but it not complying with this one for xmas christmas is getting ridic rid of their swim pool deck so it 's all done under building cuz as bill doesn 't it 's not gonna be needed for work um barrier for fireballs cause you know i understand that but if say so to put the sparkles i can 't sell your swimming pool no you can but if he had a swimming pool that was installed is there any requirement for the TAA the the local authority TOA to be notified because sometimes what happens as they put the Fallen later after they 've got the certificate of compliance and then we 've gone back and found all sorts of non-compliance anybody who wants to build a receipt your pulpit is or installer with each report is I have to get a parent and abilities right and tell me do we want to appear in person or to support the submission or not they were really key poisonous that impressed upon and international yep yeah I 'm happy to do yep all right I guess so that that would be people are generally happy that we appear in support and that we appoint a team led to do that well it may be in whether we yeah pee-wee 's it works no she doesn 't have to demonstrate but she 'll have to have fun she 'll have Judith with her anyway so ya ali i just wanted to make a point procedurally because this is really important i don 't understand why it 's causing some concern on or around the 21st of october jerk forwarded all of the information to me that was the drafted boom the digest in previous information relating to this it was forwarded to you all would be Express instruction that had you any changes or concerns you were to get back to me by the end of business the following thursday to give staff enough time to make changes so we didn 't take this discussion today essentially okay so if you don 't get that email if you don 't understand the process can you tell me and I 'll alter it 's like it 's all go gee that 's witty he would think this just wanted a son Dave I 'm just quite happy to support this and having chaired a submission spend on actually here we went through 93 porn certification spiteful certifications they were all very mundane all the pulse had lockable lids on them and it was really just a quite a inappropriate use of staff time to have to go through all that process and this this amendment this bill would change all that we wouldn 't have to be going down that track and certifying a lot of poems that sparkles particularly that already comply and I think for noting in the submission one part was quite clear there was to be a clear directive to retailers of sparkles to actually make sure that their obligations are well well known and supplying them with lockable lids to this bar pools and all this sort of stuff so our count our staff is spent in an order an amount of time on these these issues which this amendment will save them huge huge time just a question following on from there do does anyone know if when you buy a sparkle now they all here Flocka bullets is it compulsory because it seems to me retailers are obliged to identify logical way to go to actually have it unlockable is obligatory on onstar course if we 're not going to inspect them you it would make sense either no can I just clarify their submission we talked about captain sparkle covers is it what we give a biblical there yet so do you know if you I don 't know if there 's a requirement on manufacturers to sell them with lockable lids got it like I me I don 't know that anybody wouldn 't so it would it be if it 's not obligatory would it be in our scope as a council to require that in order to alleviate us from inspecting no because at the moment the wreck one even a lockable Sparkle it isn 't it doesn 't make your requirements of the pizza of Swing palsy you have to seek an exemption from the act if you 've got a lot of all that so the requirement for the from the council perspective is a few to the spark or what should heaven a fence around here but after this goes through after this have and provided as a lockable lid yeah I 'm coming from so we 're using the lockable lid to build into this but it is no obligation to have a lockable but then they need a builder is the same if you haven 't been their leader there is only really don 't see me so everyone 's going to have a lockable bug you know and I don 't they 'll need a burning building code yeah or they 'll have to have another barrier like a feeds issue so it 's going to take some really clear messaging to get this out to people well no it 's only a bill you 're making a submission on a bill the government will consider the bill and when the bill is completed then obviously will be wanting to be part of a nationwide education yeah I 'm playing around not intended unforced until the first of January 2017 service there 's plenty of time so what we should because we should ask to be good we don 't necessarily need to be heard in person and this they coming down to Christchurch but otherwise we could just do a video or oral yep yep audio be good yeah all right which means that others could actually attend as well so all right so Ellie you 'd like

    "text": "it 's now we have the application to the Metropolitan 2015-16 discretionary response and would someone like to move the staff recommendation andrew is seeking to tim is there any discussion do we need stuff yes yes nothing more to these questions yeah okay okay clean then Pauline thank you just on the obviously all the applications have suggested that they be declined but with the birthing unit there no for Christchurch I note that nationally this is not recognized I can 't see why prostitute could not lead the way considering that we have a social and Democrat our geographic constituency that 's a part of town actually so I can see the rationality but why couldn 't the council make a contribution and what are the other options are the equally well good morning everyone and absolutely agree with you and I think a beacon taste it goes just from a financial point of view and they also add the fenders we think would be more appropriate but I would love to see crush it lead the way but that 's a personal then and I had to just thinking whether or not we could provide those funds or whether or not the Murray ones metal-free could actually go on in seek funding elsewhere yep reporting that was pretty much my question to do we help them point them in other directions for function I will be absolutely thought was funny autumn wood and also if they apply to us in case these other two don 't succeed because the total cost was sinful so they may will succeed with the other time I believe so I believe so from what I understand from what I 've spoken to the woman about it there 's huge support and cdhb have been interested but and able to fund at the moment bed there at legend sees have indication entries by wanting to talk about it more ok so I just wanted to make sure that we do help them to to apply elsewhere and puts more appropriate family so that 's good thinking Jonny life yeah i mean i understand intent of this project request and think it 's got a lot of mirror but do we make with to the health board antenna talking about these groups that are coming to us or what effectively as their funding or should be being this clean Thunder through the health school it sneaks one question I not met with the cdhb I 've actually got to see Jerry background and there 's protein for me to going to speak with them with them up it 's an appropriate thing for me to do but only do you think it would be good for us at a government 's level I would have a meeting with you know that health food and actually just talk through some of these these issues because it does come up throughout funding on quite a regular basis leave so I put this huge potential for them maybe I could suggest that as a recommendation Vanessa sleeping lies yeah so um well that the council that the council mate with the cdhb to discuss matters equivalent to a soul council meet with your board of the cdhb i think so i could be quite good quite timely we used to ever Joint Working Party that looked people felt that was actually quite a good playing originally but obviously that that 's moved on but I think it would be I think it would be good for us to meet but yeah but so at a government sleeve I think it would be good yet the other question I had was around my tahoe with are there been any approach to know tahoe iran from what i understand frame rate you see his impression i tell you i mean this is really from what I understand of this project it is still there 's potential for it it depends on whether not boo what President this be an indication of blue bird will be closing eventually so this really is them not even sitting at the spear thing you do is providing a feasibility study to see whether or not this actually going the engagement and interest from the related communities so we 're just going to meet with them to discuss the funding of community groups or are we going to meet with them to discuss something more than a well I think it should be our housing chubb that there 's other things maybe around the original I mean who knows but it does seem to me it no no we 'd have to establish it an agenda I 'm extremely busy at the moment as you might imagine as our way and so that the full council meet with the cdhb board to discuss what I don 't want to list i want to narrow this down i want to risk even in a gene no no I don 't mean an agenda now I mean usage we need to be puttin that ginger together so why don 't we why don 't_''_343.36 we ask Mary it to put together an agenda yep ok so we to discuss a range of matters to be agreed yeah yeah okay right I 'll pop that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried x _"

    "text": "transport and environment and now that feels here we 'll take it full moved and terminal cinder and i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried and now we 'll move on to item 9 the canterbury civil defense emergency management groups capability assessment report and invite Murray Sinclair to come to the table and perhaps you 'd like to run through that for us thanks sorry thank you presume the speakers on this report as they report for the full Canterbury subpoena appearance that covers from kaikoura right down to why meeting each of the TAS and emergency services required to do a self-assessment covering the goals and the two neighbors that are mentioned in the report and then the ministry take that those results along with the cannery silicates group office is based in chester street to come up with us finalized report they then moderate the self assessment scores to come up with the overall score and i would like to submit one error in my report to you and 3.9 where i 've made that the was 68.6 that was actually the group self-assessment school and moderate in school was sixteen point six pm so there has been an increase improvement under the scoring of the whole can recruit from 2016 is now going up to sixty six point three percent which puts us in the advanced in category there is one tire level category that we can get into which is the mature but that the from am exempt point of view we are in a very acceptable level being in the advancing level the report of the mentioned goes through the four goals and those goals come out of the National silver fleets a strategy first one be into a crease community awareness understanding preparedness and participation and sleet in subjective mental sick members reduce the risks from heathers to New Zealand the third goal is to enhance the capability to manage silicates emergencies and then this fourth one is to enhance their capability to recover from emergencies they then put in two enablers went around the governance and management arrangements and then the second enablers round organizational resilience to support vector format crisis other resilience work that 's been done as well the reports pretty thorough as far as it goes through it identifies under each of them the strengths for the Canterbury group in the areas for improvement and in the report I put that our own self assessment which was Appendix B to the report mirrors in many ways the same result as the overall cannery report does for our goal 1 and increasing community awareness we scored ourselves higher than the group average we invest quite a bit in this area through through staffing and I think the other thing that the report does comment on the different sizes and some of the council 's we 've got a large team here by comparison to other can read cas some of the likes of hora y media and have a part-time person and they might only has been one day for a week effect on their some of its arrangements with its relevance of the scale and population of thought but we are reasonably well resourced for the 17th activities and Christchurch I don 't know whether you want to portal here you want down but I 'm happy there are two questions of the go through and pulling Thank You Miriam welcome I 'm just wondering about civil defense training how long does it take in one some to train to be capable of doing an emergency or seven persons depend on what role if we looking at our moods operations staff the that 's probably if you added ups probably following weeks training but the sort of things that you talk about suitably trained and competent yes staff so it 's that gaining that competency which is as they usually the issue and that 's done through the exercise look where people have opportunity to either go to another area where there 's been an emergency or for love our staff their comp C came through the 2010-11 death question particularly is because what one Basin my question was after the neither September is quake community board members particularly felt outside of the civil defense you know grouping there 's the sort of felt that they didn 't have guidance on what to do and a lot of 'm a review that it would be quite good to Train elected members in civil defense because they know their communities really well so what 's your thought on there are definitely what we can take through that what we feel is EOC one which operation is as a no of your helmet operations in our beliefs that be very good one for the board members to go through ya see one ya I think I 'm we refer to it is but it would also be worthwhile going through some of the wealthier training which is the key area for the well-being issues which I suspect which we 're the board 's focus would want to be and that would cover roughly the sort of work we 're trying to engage now communities but media response been so a lot of it 's not just the response but the preparation work I voice Eddie then this what we do and preparedness pays dividend through through response in in also in recovery so we can run through any board member or do by boards or click the trainer not imagine evenings a couple of hours positions up like that let it be great yeah I 'm Phil Andruw Yanni thanks Murray and it 's a good clear report and take your point that it 's a overview of kendry and christchurch fits into there and just sort of following pulleys christian for this one like in terms of that part i do know too that there 's things on page 19 it 's clear reference to how the reason preps there hasn 't been more involvement is because of what 's called region-wide fatigue as a consequences of 2,000 team so that betters um that 's clear in the reports clear to on areas that need improvement and so with the sort of the area of community response planning to i 'm just wondering if following hawlings question if in the future that might be an area which in fact council could delegate to community boards as a clear delegation of responsibility as part of governance does that would is that a possibility oh I think they because I mean we 've been to a couple of boards what those with the communities we work for the strengthening community teams are based at the service centers and the boards are engaging with the various community group so we 're not trying to reinvent groups or networks we want to go and with the strengthening communities put the boards and it is very good to have a say about six monthly report guns abort or involvement and get boards on board when they are looking at working with the community groups developer going mergency plans okay thanks man i should say note on that one of the key things coming out of the the februari 2011 quakes was there are a number of community groups that self start a graceful and searching for a good example littleton for this time beckenham and of what they didn 't know was how to connect them to something fierce and that 's been one of our low and annoyances i cover those three things the community need identify what are the community that to be geographically faith could be if that what was also do they have themselves and then the key thing from the a lot of external rangements are done free it has to be done Priya Venus thanks very Andrew yarn even Jimmy Thank You Marie you 've gone some way to answering the question I 'm going to put in your response to the two previous questions but yeah I certainly wanted to focus on what I would term community-led civil defense so a grassroots up approach a theory that the community knows itself better than anybody else knows that community and where there 's capability in that community we need to harness that to get the best civil defense outcome which is owned by that community and you 'll be certainly very aware of some of the early conversations that were had in littleton where there was definitely energy and capability and there were some frustrations around that as well I 'm encouraged by some of the comments in the report but I guess I was just looking for a level of confidence that we 've really moved on in our thinking to a more grassroots approach from the point that we were at maybe in 2010-2011 maybe 18 more of a hierarchical structure before so the community were part of that hierarchy turn that upside down it 's got to be the other way around we should be there to support the community not to tell the community how to do things so that 's where the weather changes come on now with the community response plans that it 's there there they know their community better they know what resources I 've got to a cup of themselves and an example of that after the September 2010 earthquaker today I went out to the Brooklyn 's community of a discussion of Mount via and I thought only going to our volunteers between a full room of the whole community there was some criticism of us about resourcing and they lot about generator but that a woman down the back stood up and said look I 'm belong to the resident Association if you ask me I could have told you where there is a degenerated winter community so again it 's encouraging the communities themselves to talk to each other and that 's what we 're trying a cross-section of the community and what we do rely on with on that on that basis those emergency planning is having drivers key leaders from the community take the lead from without those leaders the plans will fall over that 's why we don 't want to really pick up but we might learn previously so what will look after us that we need to be working with the community so they take the ownership of the plane just say I 'm still they know the their own community and our resources and we just need to connect them with our networks within the wider community Danny yeah thank you thank you for that I 'll just interested is their kind of a paper that sucked at lessons learned from the earthquakes and the flooding and incarnate isin to have what the response was and what we could do to improve the ministry took the lead on the record there 's a review of the 2011 fifth way and make them took the the lead on the correct connection plan then and they categorize them into about 12 102 have just signed off on those that they were completed last month but how do how do we know as a council the lessons learned from those earthquakes document is but the question is how do we put them into practice ourselves and that 's what we 're working through with the kid regrouping ourself to identify those ones the specific arriving to a local level and a number them are at the national level which we don 't even control live on one example but with a minute or so it fits as locate it was previous with Department till fears well that 's going across to the partner Kevin promissory camera well be on there but there are a number of those recommendations that we are keeping an eye on and making sure we 've implemented our own 30 quick connection planning the other the other concern I heard from this was the areas of improvement was the public education and also the public information management plan coordinated and given priority too and it just seems to me like when you have things like possible events but there take high winds for example there 's very little information that comes out you see all the street signs fallen over I mean there may be work that 's going on behind the scenes but in terms of the public information seems very kind of limited as is there anything that we can do as a council to improve them one of the ideas i 'll put for previously has just one sort of red button that the mirror could push or someone could push and it just sends a mess email or distribution to text to kind of give people a bit of a heads up we are evaluating some of the apps that are available at the moment there 's a company of New York and called cloud in then auckland use that they 've got a net that they just put people got a lot log onto that 's that 's a difficulty of the Ministry of still defense are currently investigating they 've got a scoping out for interest of a moment for the development of a national of Bolivian system which is based around cell off a cell phone area put the message out through that one that can be controlled locally but there 's still a lot of work to be done on that one Red Cross have got an appt council also we 've got a scuffle wit gun on right at the moment that out what apps are out available that we could be using locally so we haven 't finished that will just scoped out that but a week so we 're talking to clarity and we 're talking to recross and there are a number of apps are available they don 't get too confused on how many apps we use but there is a there is a gap we fared safe on getting that initial thing out to the community that moment alerting them something 's coming on so so we did actually resolve that I 'm during the long term plan that if the Civil Defence section could find the money from its existing budget that we would look at signing on to the was it the cloud iam clearly option and that and I 've signed up that it just will send messages through if there 's a message to be seen through but you do need people to log on to it but an Auckland they 've had quite a good uptake haven 't they poof yeah so and I think that with the amount of uptake about you know these smartphones I think that it wouldn 't be hard to get people to sign up to it if we were to go down this track the advantage of that the particular model that they 've proposed that should civil defense bring in one for the whole country that we can just simply change to that without an attachment what I was interested in at a regional level is that we spent thousands of hours getting databases so we had stronger Christchurch traffic it was originally then we had CD in public info we have all these huge databases of people that have already signed up to get regular information but we don 't seem to activate those if ones are going to say here 's five things you can do to minimize the impact we we couldn 't actually develop one one thing there but do we do we need to put more money on budget for that public information is that as that Dakota critical phone well I think I 've said to me at the moment we 're going to go for the the cloud in at we would find that funding from your own budget was something about 35,000 Cranham the the Red Cross have come out one that 's also got on the looting capable of unit and their one 's free so this is why we 're sort of at the moment currently evaluating watch the out there before we take that step and sign up with any particular one but what about just one thing for us as a city just what like a mass email was what 's wrong with that idea that doesn 't cost us any money there 's effectively free and and we can actually get this information out to people I 'm not quite sure he do messy male could people who still need to reach the run to the air somehow as well you want hurt me what we wouldn 't want to be managing at the stuff you did really want people subscribing to it but they manage it so and that 's effectively what the clarity met does so they subscribe into it and then you can shoot at once alone you just shoot out the me to say hi ones coming up or whatever the messages game for texting you 're limited to 160 characters company but you still get a regional message out there walk high winds coming up refer to council website of some fence or something like that you have to be careful Yannick because my knowledge of this and it 's not as extensive as others but if you hear if you use emails for things that are not relevant to what people need information for so if you send information to people and they don 't need it they 'll stop they 'll stop using it and that 's why having an act that 's specific to you know a civil defense message is actually really vital and I mean I 'm a big supporter ltp but he put pressure on married and find the money from his existing budget so we 're expecting a report back on that hopefully sometime soon to three months yep just the final question though i had was around that has there been any debrief around the flooding and any lessons learned from though there was a debrief round the flooding you talking that public education messages and or just anything in terms of a certain defense response well this comes locally so it comes back into the council for that for local flooding as opposed to the regional group I think we 've included anything that we come I think again that 's just game hitting the messages out prior to the morning the weather forecasts and getting those messages out to people it is still a difficult one to do because there 's no certainty in stuff for rainfall impact so and then some of the mitigation measures that counsel them with the end rate of recovery plan hopefully want me to get some of those issues as well but again we 're trying to encourage the themselves what they can do and how they can support each other and the more we encourage community support each other that effectively that means let 's there there were horses there to help each other out with us supporting them in any way we can yeah Jimmy okay yeah well questianus and regarding to the three-point okay the area strength for improvement included especially for white to increase community aware understanding preparedness in the participation city yet I 'm contigo consented to kind of category one is that our training training the other one is the information the provision training a moment your way up to us Quaker quite a few workers in quite your country cottage and the more community specialty communities kind of multicultural community etc a moment whether we have a figure we got into either community the training regarding c d e f of volunteer one interpreter training how much percent you for those the multicultural group whether they have this kind of training in other ones we got into the information especially you know how to dealing with the earthquake issue essential nature as fright as one page they keep to name maybe clearly you know how to do it yes yeah what we do work with the cool communities on there and there are the the get really get through public education document is available about five different six different languages so any time we 're going out to any of those ethnic groups will take the appropriate language one with them they 're available on website as well we tell people so to try and get the same thing miss just through that to preparedness the hazards that are facing that people want facial in christchurch as well if I hope how many of kind of volunteer from the SD blue imma be straining how many volunteer yeah volunteering is targeted she 's targeting for people come and helps out in the wealthiest centers within the community I would say of these thick minorities that would be I 'm application of figured it 'd be well listen fiber see it 's a small very small but we are we do try and engage with the ethnic groups and going out and talking welcome volunteers but we will try and target the that group can go out and talk to them specifically about the issues that they might be facing if they want about what Bell volunteer we would work with them as well incall just go back to the database terrace and you can be the kid with databases say his laws around spamming in and the purpose of why you 're sending out emails or you fish you subscribe to so I think the self log on to your ideas issue sipping a bit of way to go some people why people have databases put down that you use them properly and database is a half minutes thanks so if we leave it to people to subscribe themselves there 's some men do yep right so it 's someone like to move that the report be received Jamie seeking to pull I put that motion all those in favor say aye there 's a person no that 's carried thanks Marie thanks very much _"

    "text": "till with some here Pauline would you like to take us through that yep first off we have the most energy action plan so we because we 're actually we already have a sustainable energy strategy 2008 to 18 we agree that we didn 't require a require review of that and we would just work on implementing the the six program areas that the committee recommendation is also requested staff it was an informal group of the committee developed to develop these key actions to opening the strategy so I mean this is a really really good program we 've already with these six serious is a lot of it already happening with the internal energy management program we 've got eco on board with it to measure and manage our internal energy with our commercial energy efficiency we 've got target sustainability which is helping many many businesses and commercial buildings to actually save a lot of money every year on their energy programs we 've got the bill beck smarter program for the residential we 've got our transport energy efficiency renewable energy program are supporting our program we 're looking at data portals which some sound impressive i 'm not sure how they work but to use public communication informational portal to develop this to publicize the types and quantities of energy use and christchurch and how this relates to carbon emissions so that 's really exciting too and then we 've got our energy efficient renewable energy crisis tourism program which is actually going to look at attracting tourism to look at how we are running our energy in our cities reducing our emissions and setting ourselves up there 's a bit of a leader in this area which is actually what we 've been asked to do this year an idea in my view so though that 's a bit of a rundown it and did you want to move these recommendations secretly easily so if you could move or move the um what was the committee recommendation so it just got the little video blogging you this right so Paul unkosher moved seconded by Bucky back quite just explained yet the concept of living with the working group of the infrastructure committee was because the concepts are there but the actual date by which they will be implemented is not quite so clear so an action plan that actually follows on from these big concepts some of the very simple ones for example to Hathaway the horse will center has actually been built without solar panels but we are now looking at putting the solar panels and after but it would be sensible in new builds to look at them going in and there is a company in town that will put them in at no cost and do the capital cost and you you contract free electricity for a period of time where we 're actually paying for the electricity because you 're paying a reduced amount that makes sense for us to put solar panels on their new builds and but just just what we wanted to do was to make sure that we had clear timelines and that we were achieving and on the whole thing all right i 'll put that motion yep yep i just had a quick because listen we are just lining the soft out of the page 36 is that right yeah yeah so if my question is because own recommendation sees agree that a full review of the sustainable energy strategy is not required the share this year so it will be done in the next and your plan period is that rifle what we well we 've got a sustainable energy strategy 2008 to 18 that 's the 10-year period clearly we 've had of quakes and the whole environment has changed immensely has that it what does that not need to be addressed I thought that that was the point that they were making is that it 's a perfectly good plan it still as I don 't know I don 't need to answer the question for others I 'll reason but they want to develop key actions to implement the strategy for presentation to the next meeting but under the residential which is in the next I have some questions around lateral supporting right fruit some Crips Cuban could answer it mean okay your sister to follow on from that the strategy still has those key objectives they were all so the action so it was considered by staff it 's quite a costly exercise to do a strategy you 've already got one there the two key objectives still stand so the action plan is actually to get out there and do something based under those strategy objectives so sorry and of course because those strategies I 'm assuming that increase in the share of renewable energies that right am I correct them to its current and ex well as reduction in total energy use that 's correct so my question is with thousands and thousands of houses being rebuilt in Christchurch and I know we 've got Phil vex Marcia but I 'm talking personal experience as well I would strongly suggest that there isn 't enough focus on solar and sustainability of builds and what they need to be addressed in the strategy as a result of the earthquake so this doesn 't quite cut it so early actually that 's what we 've tried to address them the district plan review where we 've tried to raise the build for residential 26 to host our sex this not understand that I 'm not talking about host assets I 'm talking about right person distance and Christchurch being able to access not only information that sorcerer role for example or solo records to be perfectly frank is all around and making that much more accessible loot liya and making that a really key important part of the strategy that needs to be addressed in my opinion because of the situation we find ourselves an unclean place why don 't we just add that to the target and I 'm sorry if this is a problematic at the slight snag but absolutely the question would be to keep it as that and here 's some with it is i think the intentions definitely look at renewable energy where it 's practical the good news is we 've got and if a representative from eager here eco with talk nikka about this residential area in solar power and from my understanding they are launching a new tool next year and to help consumers better make that decision on the top 10 things to look at in there adiel built information it has got to be our job as a solicitation right so that 's why I think it 's got to be part of our strategy that 's why we 've got to have a strategy that says here 's what we 're actually doing and when we 're doing it by until we have that well it 's always liked radiations what we haven 't got is the action plan that says this so what I think they bad CICS connection between continuum of the policy that was you know drafted 2008 2009 anyway remember so the working group will address said because it 's actually in the spin the strategy for renewable energy angle there so we can we can bring it unto the h and O 'Malley point is that if you 're rebuilding your house or fixing your house how do you know we are all those things are is the go-to place for all that information mm-hm and if you don 't do it then we 'll have to thank you nanny yeah can I just ask on that we 've had two things projector in an eco design advisor that was based on a kind of show show home and then I think fell over three lack of funding and I think it 's what Nelson City Council dunas apparently quite quite a good intervention rather decides independent people giving you advice rather than the companies that provide the products and services and the signal as we had the deputation to the cheetah committee around that model around that death housing from the architects end and I just I mean I know we can 't get into all the details here but where we talking about under three the energy efficient homes is no recognition of those other opportunities of existing things we could be doing so is there a way we can kind of get those put into this process enough so he 'll but I 'm feeling constrained because i 'm actually using Bob minute to read it to rebuild our house so I don 't want to call me too clunky thing in relation to that but in relation to the 10 homes that were in Eddington there was a to people and certainly a lot of people have been through that but if you want to add something to it and I only just edit and we 'll consider that that we can group or come on the weekend group so when you see ya we don 't yeah we 're solution anything yeah okay Annie do you want to go on the week and greg 's as well I absolutely no interest in Rhodesia yeah is that it that 's it great yep right okay whoever whatever hey boy whatever I learned how to speak their language right okay so i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried electric vehicle car sharing 14 right so now this is very another very interesting one I think that this is looking at Council really leaving this one again it also looks back into the project energy action plan with the objectives of course and its really looking at part of the modal shift as Christchurch is currently has the highest rate of car ownership in New Zealand so we 're going to take a while to bring in we have to look once again at gathering the data and you know we 've it 's not actually intended to be as daily use of you know right from the beginning but it has actually grown in popularity over the last 10 years but the restrictions are that the still very few cities that have widespread networks of plug-in EV facilities so a willing operator would need the assurance of of this charging infrastructure and that 's why we 've asked staff to release of stuff to make this as easy as possible so we 're looking at this modal shift we 've obviously got the slow zone and the CBD what cycleways programs developing really well safe pedestrian working hard on our public transport and so this is not another layer and eating our transport and energy systems going really well so the the public electric vehicle sharing program will support all the goals that we 've already gotten our own strategy with their own progeny an introduction plan and we want to encourage the uptake of electric vehicles by transport strategic plan which is the goal to create opportunities for environmental enhancement and renewable transport innovations to support our low carbon emissions in christchurch so to me i 'm looking at option one is the preferred option i really do hope you support it because going back to the sheer an idea it 's what people wanted they want a degree in city they want a safe city and we can we really got to look at reducing our carbon emissions globally and we want Christchurch be leading this and this is our opportunity to really get it behind so it is still an investigative stage as it still does need the data in the measurements to actually feed into the splits the beginning so I support Richie to support this I 'm pergi these two actually this was quite an exciting as he committee the work of it was all about a really cool stuff and so this one item number two the electric vehicle pass hearing and the next item the shared fleet options and proposal and very linked and so what may well happen is that not just the saving of money but also the electrification of the fleet and you 'll notice that as a note and recommendations it also means that we can share with other government agencies and potentially others as well but what may come out of that is in fact part of that fleet being used for example at night as part of the cashiering that we the public cashiering as well so my hunch is that the car-sharing will probably be part of the shared fleet options and proposal which goes out in February of next year but the car sharing in itself I mean there is a number of really important things about that electrification of corporate fleets and government and council fleets actually increases dramatically the uptake of second-hand electric vehicles within the country and that 's really important that we lead on it and rotate it I don 't even think its leading just a reasonably fast approach to it and and sixty percent I think of our and fossil fuel usage in the city is at the moment in the transport fleet so if we 're government 's it is going going to sit in Paris we have to address the transport industry there is there is no other way of doing it so the joy of car sharing is that you actually just pay for the vehicle as you use it we all own vehicles that use them but leave them in the garages for a vast array of time we all have electric vehicle sharings electric vehicle charging stations in our garages so there 's one and a half a million of them in the country we will probably need about five and in and around the central city in and around the city as a whole to overcome a lot electric vehicle owners have which is a thing called range anxiety and that they 're going to run out of places that they can travel to that don 't have carry that don 't have charging stations that stuff did with Iker a stunning and presentation on to hotels and businesses and malls on putting out charging stations in those and there has already been up some uptake of those from at least are private people who want to come in and put charging stations into the city that prepared to fund them so there is an enormous amount happening in this area I suspect what will happen in Christchurch is that will do the shared fleet and part of that will result in a proposal which has car sharing for the public as part of it and that will lead both of those will have a very clear pathway to major electrification of the fleet the joy of cashiering is if you need a car to go skiing you can share that car if you need a car because you 're shifting houses so many of us are you can just use that car or that vehicle for the weekend you don 't have to actually own those vehicles and you don 't have to pay for the cost of storing them all at the time I think it 's something that will be incredibly exciting and the work that staff are doing on electric vehicle cashier will well I suspect lead to two major outcomes one major saving for the council vehicles which eventually will pass on and which increases the uptake of electric vehicles across the whole city which is exciting Paul le the one thing that 's operative here are the reporters and talks about the long alkyl a lot of patent applications we come to replace vehicles with only budget for sixteen or seventeen thousand dollars but if we 're fleet sharing the cost of original papers which is obviously thirty to forty thousand dollars we reduce because we wanted to buy as many cars because we really there for everybody it is way more about that I just don 't think it comes across the report yet that sort of shoulders a negative rather than a C+ for sure should be no good question so depending on the business case later in the year it might mean that council goes to market for the supply of vehicles so we may not depending on business case and council decision actually own the vehicles so they could be so the report did right if we were looking at electrification it would take years to to change it now that be a cheaper model to go to market you know this that 's another question on that so we have a vehicle fleets in the car park on that 's costs us a huge amount of money we caught an actual fact that after at the hours of use we could actually have those fleets available for public use all surface as well something actually they would negate the necessity for as much practice leavin opening exactly that 's a real benefit for the city and as counselor looking back was saying potential electrification as well le excuse me 42 5.28 the funding reprioritization of the 2015-16 strategic policy and planning activity work program what does that mean and we will the money come from leaving something else unfunded I just wanted to put more information around there please so that sorry was out in the regards to the shared fleet protein that 's with regard to the early cool it 's under option one for food develop a policy framework for electric vehicles in the area that 's the cashier in component of it just just point out the the 2015-16 strategic policy and an activity work program that 's for the for the for the policy work yes so for those ears while I 'm guessing up relates to the 12,000 dollars well within strategy and Finance they have a variety of work on their program we reprioritize that work so that this work gets done yes my question is what see drop drop I don 't know yeah I mean I does it meet her oh well I just like a bit more detail it 's in so certain the means right it said simply do with staff time and in terms of us needing to reprioritize I don 't think we 've got any plans to drop anything just at the moment it 's more a matter of pushing some stuff back and peps elevating the civ council wants this to be a priority for us so it 's this kind of constant juggling neck that we go through in terms of our work program to kind of meet the demands that come through council can be confident that it 's not you know key work I mean it 's okay but that there are a few things that we would have liked to a started but probably haven 't_''_1212.02 at this stage so I think we 'll have to see how much leagues the skits and tubes the you know how much resource we have to throw in it and then we still need to have a discussion with you about our work program so you know at that stage will go well this is the implications of us continue to spend a lot of Primus other things may have to fall by the wayside but that 's a discussion of storage okay thank you yeah I yani yeah I just had two questions one was the council would have a process on an annual basis we would sign off on the strategy policy and planning work program is that coming to us and if so when yes we 're looking to get a break in time for you as soon as we can so we 're hoping that that 'll be imminent okay so maybe there will be a report to council after their 's the opportunity to to work out what 's happening that 's that 's good thank you um and then um this council kind of lead the way and needs another time for electric buses but buses have kind of been dropped off is it been in discussion around you know actually the greatest shared vehicle which is probably a bus for business so i really like us to do some work on them um how do we get work progressing with us don 't_''_1284.02 we have to don 't don 't we have to get the regulator to insist on electric buses owners nikken these issues what 's the size of electric buses in the weight of the money averages but we 're looking at I think there 's some new ones being developed overseas and I want it so much smaller ones and and actually given the number of people that I see on the bus and may not be a bad idea exactly I mean we didn 't have to work for the regulators have a yellow shuttles going around the central city but we pay for try one and I but I was thinking about that on the way to work this morning after having looked at this thinking we could actually we could actually go ahead and trial an electric bass the smaller smaller size and and and see what that delivers but I wouldn 't want it just to be around the CBD I 'd actually want us to trial that a much more effective and efficient service to the city so so that 's always really keen for us to kind of a learn the lessons of the other shuttles because they were really good good in terms of branding an image probably the electric stuff there was somebody since learned about the technology at the time but but it 's quite a interesting case study and then what you 'll hopefully look at what we could do going forward because I but I just like us to try and progress that is this the right place or is it part of that working party that certainly those discussions are ongoing as part of the public transport working group and there was a come back to that group with some information but as councillor quarter mentioned there are some issues in terms of the way sighs technology but technology sydney advanced quite a bit since a few years ago but and that 's why we can 't keep the yellow ones everything is right there very good pastor but passing well as we wanted to get them out but it 's going to be you know like everything 's going to increase exponentially you know very quickly you know it 's just I don 't know where the people kind of really realize just how how quickly things are going to change and we need to be I mean we 've got the ideal opportunity we 're rebuilding our silly we 've got the opportunity to be a world leader in this regard and not into be at the front end not not free I mean at the thing is as people worried that it 's going to cost more but it 's actually going to cost more if we don 't actually change the way we do things fundamentally change the way her support we 're not in debate are we were just a question so anyway so no resolutions now around the buses just this work going on with others and probably public with program we can razor is initiative o 'clock well this is that this is the cook called me put a a request for four proposals around electorate a pilot a pilot electric bus pilot approaches which is just even if even if we could have a phrase inthere that indicates that we came for staff to develop you know some work around a pilot bus electric bus option for Christchurch um what they got do you think the word shuttle won 't be a bit about the bus no no just on one route hips something yeah it 's tough um yep did just one comment with with the energy action claim that you 've adopted and part of the discussions with the working group it 's looking at electrification of vehicles from organisations so we can put it in under there okay and with EK will work very closely with them so when there 's a timings right to trial we can work with EK around that okay we 've got it covered under year yeah okay so we don 't need to write a specific reference into this resolution I don 't believe so at the moment but with the Working Party we won 't discuss head and hair we can have a nation discussing version differences okay yeah and you promise that you will oh it 's no danger I know I know this is a high risk of leaving it to Bucky because she 's just not interested sorry it was facetious and for anyone it 's routine right okay so this is moved by pauline seconded by Bucky and is there any discussion yeah me I 'm just a big break I mean I really support us doing this work as part of the LTP we changed activity management plan to our staff to report at regular intervals around innovative transport solutions for our city and I see this is kind of the first one of those so thank you to the committee and staff for the work that 's been done the point that we have the most amazing opportunity to different it 's completely differently because of the earthquake and because of the opportunities of that presents it would be a real shame if we couldn 't catch some of the progressive things that we 've done previously like those electric yellow shuttles or looking at new technologies and cars to around electrification or other even other technologies that that are being developed so I 'm really supportive of us I think you know it 's great to see that the activity management plan levels of service that we 've set are now sort of working their way through to getting the outcomes that we 've that we 've expected and um yeah thank you for those people that have been involved I strongly support this great excellent oh and I just said it this is the beginning of something it 's amazing so it 's about look at providing the guidance for our requirements for this and for the long-term sustainability of our city and you know that is happening around the world in other places but if we have a small population as I say it 's part of the modal change we 've got to give him behind us and it 's a chicken and an egg so if we thought that people will jump on and join it so it sounds a little bit out there at the moment particularly because we are so we did to our own cars and I don 't think I 'd like anyone sharing mine actually but anyway that 's another it 's a lot of area but it really is a beginning point in our think Christchurch we should be proud that we are leading away and these sustainable initiatives and staff have done huge in roof on it fishing lucky lucky to have you so yeah now I certainly support this and Paul it 's quicker nokia i think that by doing this work now I think the exponential change is coming and it 's going to be here before we even though and if we don 't start this route now we are going to behind the a think so i think get in behind it and we talked about you know the university not being the center of our city doesn 't actually necessary an interview we need our students living in the city now if we have our students living in the city we need a shovel or a bus service that goes backwards and forwards on regular basis and and sustainably and move people around whether want to go do quickly and i think this is a real with satsang pretty supportive yep alright i 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye as opposed i know that 's carried and then to the shared fleet options in proposal again pauline you 'd like to move that in buckhead like second what kind of covered most of it off really have conversations at once again it is the council leading us but also we 're agreeing that that we support eager to manage and facilitate this so eager as being incredibly supportive than these initiatives for us so i don 't know if there 's much more to be reseated about this the key we 've kind of covered most of it had together yeah it 's good on with it yes yeah no I mean it 's just I just think that this is absolutely the way of the future the idea that every single government department every single council every single you know sort of agency that provides service has to have their own fleet of cars there 's just its historic merits it 's out of date and we have you actually got to lead the way so I 'm really supportive of this I think it could not only project incredible savings for government and local government but actually could start to change people 's perceptions of of using cars and move to that electrification that will make a difference that 's right and it 's about working on partnering agencies and picking up more of them along the way and once a few people get on board and agencies that more will come and the whole thing will grow and it just works yep yeah good i 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye as opposed i know that 's carried cooking on guess mouth shut all right so is as you recall we were waiting on the reports from the comments from the agencies that you 've wrote a letter to the N and particularly Knight are who you had some definite concerns about it particularly relating to the interpretation for treated for a Tony in a report and so and also in the financial side of it before the report was done there was a preps of misconception that the existing stop banks would no longer be required and from the report that 's been revealed that that 's not the case so that makes a very big difference financially to the viability of a title barrier which she knows and the millions and millions of dollars to to build it so that has made a big difference in the liability so the recommendation that we 've come to us that we not proceed to a full feasibility study at this stage under the land drainage recovery program and we 've also put a note view at the because we had a deputation from the South Shore residents association just just noting sea level rise I 'd actually like to amend the wording of 5.2 if I may it hasn 't sort of reflected it very well in my view yeah so could I just have it read them they had that note the feedback from the South Shore residents association of the potential threat to boot habitat and feeding areas posed by sea level rise that 's all we need um I 'm I was a little confused by this i mean i 'm going to take people 's kitchens but i was confused by this because the staff recommendation talked about the information being considered as one of the engineering optional add protection is and the minimum please yeah remove the story right okay okay well that 's good so right but i also wanted to kind of clarify as to why the committee didn 't I mean I can understand them not agreeing with 4.2 but I can 't understand why 4.3 is not included and the committee recommendation well the reason we didn 't include that Leanne was because the report was about the continuing on with a levels point 23 as different it says to continue to work closely with Sarah on the options for floodplain management as part of the technical work on the future use of the residential red zone I want to know why bet is not included on the recommendation from the kamati it 's probably an oversight and it could easily go and and the issues with the committee was that yes sir that was the intention you 're right so so quirky Cecina so they put so yeah 4.3 could be moved at annas in 5.3 yeah yeah it was really awkward to that yeah it was interpreters I wanted going truck and trailer with them sort of barrier so they were a bit renault about including that as well no I in a different view to that yeah i thought we definitely have to love it yeah yeah okay did all the options is fine so yeah yeah and actually it should be the other way around so 5.2 should become 5.3 so yeah so swap them around that 's right and why why are you noting just the feedback from the from the ester II trust because he 's a different angle was just noting that the sea level rise was going to sweeten good feeding inhibit its and food feeding areas that 's all Soviet the other ones for more in relation to the extra barrier and we could note all of the feedback if you want to I 'm not yeah I just think that it might be better oh the other ones are more about the interest yet sure and the you know the amenity the costings all those things that actually and the technical report it 's yeah wasn 't just there um wasn 't my reading of it not there is no happy to put a note here things if you want to it 's good there 's when people come I know you just put 5.1 and your 5.2 which are the same as the staff recommendation and then just take makes five we went three as a min yes yeah I voted against that inclusion of that original 5.2 in the committee recommendation principally on the point that we are making feedback and providing some protection and yet we are as a council and not prepared to offer our community any form of mitigation from flooding length coastal erosion or anything in that area and yet we are quite happy to put off a protection for bird year it 's just amazing for vote yeah no I understand mate I 'm going to put it put it separately but um what it 's simply noting the view of the social residents association so at it and that 's my part of a motion then there 's no it 's anointed it 's supposed to be a note not really there 's a nice is a Mac to the hasn 't his motion not part of the resolution yeah yeah the NX fine we 'll put it secretly you know I mean it as a noting provision but my viewers is that if we 're going to note that we actually should note the others because there was more feedback than the social residents association and I think that if we are going to vote against the staff recommendation that the information and as one of the engineering options for flood protection the development of the council 's three water 's strategy then I want us to say that we had feedback from a large number of organizations so we had feedback from he can which didn 't express with you because it 's the regulator so and because it 's the regulator at can 't_``_2258.789 express of you but it did express concerns about measures that they could be involved with helping us resolve and you know and I 'm not reading between the lines but I just feel that there wasn 't it wasn 't the enthusiasm for that I might have seen otherwise certainly wasn 't supported by no Tahoe wasn 't supported by the the the two-story trust so that associations that have been set up and it wasn 't supported by the South Shore residents association so you know that do you want to notice all those all those vultures I just think that we should be noting that we requested feedback from a range of organizations and and I don 't know whether we should specifically say then that we should say what each of them responded to so are you suggesting perhaps we just remove the note around 5.3 to make things a lot easier or we could say that it notes that the feedback from a range of organizations that were invited to comment on the pre-feasibility study did not support the proceeding with a with any further abilities feasibility work what I 'm hearing from staff and I 'm reading this and maybe we should get someone from staff to come and speak to this is that am I reading 4.1 and two together as saying that this shouldn 't proceed as part of the land drainage recovery program but that fear the work should be done in terms of the three water strategy because it says the information be considered as one of the engineering options so maybe Helen certainly the the three water 's strategy is a much broader document than a feasibility study of a particular engineering solution so the three water 's strategy is looking at waste water potable water n stormwater and we have specifically expanded the storm water including river and title flood protection and the lower Aven and the heath cut so the strategy will look at those sort of options and a broad sense but it would not take the step of them going to engineering feasibility okay so so I 'm just I 'm just unclear as to why the information and the pre feasibility report on a tidal barrier be considered as one of the engineering options for flood protection the development of the council 's three water strategy does that mean that we could then subsequently get a report saying we want to go ahead with a feasibility study on the title barrier because I think you 're getting from Council that we 're not interested in going down that track I read it as retaining the information to be put up against other why would we spend a vast amount of money on a pre fizzled feasibility study and then just this can throw it away all together should be used to compare stack up against other options but in 4.1 we are saying that we are not going to proceed with joining motion that we 've already done yeah they 're in our follow-up assessment so the information collated and the pre feasibility report be made available for for flood protection work and the development of the countless three water 's strategy I mean what I 'm trying to say is is that we 're not interested on a and a title barrier and I don 't think Sarah 's interested either after having looked at the pre-feasibility it to be honest the the recommendation is perhaps entirely redundant because the three water strategy will consider all of the information that we here and we 're certainly not so everyone right would certainly not deliberately ignore it okay so we took a full feasibility study on a title Barry does not proceed at this day under the land drainage recovery program and maybe we should just put at the end of that noting that a that the feedback from a range of organizations did not support the title barrier and then we 've got it noted that we we sought feedback him and the feedback was pretty pretty crystal clear yep a full feasibility study on Antarctic so go and then just go comma at the end of land drainage reproach yeah comma noting that feedback from a range of organizations did not support a full feasibility study because that 's included on the report that it continue to work closely with Sarah on the options for floodplain management as part of the technical work on the future use the residential red zone and the question is do we need 5.3 on that basis look I 'm happy to take it out you 've noted the feedback from the organization 's we 've had a discussion about anyone was interesting that they brought it up at the in the air feedback okay so so you 're happy to move there and are you happy to stick and that on that basis Oh still not retaining or using any of the information yeah just heard that from staff where it doesn 't say in the remit any of those illusion okay so okay and tongue but can we put on some words let just you know because I 'm trying to find going to be used but we 're not going to it doesn 't say that it doesn 't 4.2 yes I know who report and tear it up yeah that 's the debt and after so a new 5.3 saying no note that staff will utilize all of the information that was provided and the pre-feasibility study and developing the three water strategy does that work I think David just one a bit late yeah yeah we 're not going to let the information go yeah yeah but it was it was interesting because these you might recall that he can came to the long term plan hearings and said that they hadn 't been they hadn 't been included at the outset of any discussion on whether there should be a title barrier in the first place and the reason was that it was driven off the skirt project with an you know authorized by by Sarah basically so it hadn 't come to counsel before the pre-feasibility work was done but you 're quite right we wouldn 't want to waste the information that has been obtained all we 're not ones making this decision is has just been pointed out this is hug this is Sarah NZTA and council but it 's not it 's a horizontal infrastructure governance growth that 's responsible for the total barrier for study so shouldn 't we be directing them so that it 's really clear because what I worry about is that they 'll just go away and do it anyway so as the start of this process so I just wanted to check whether we need to a resolution that makes it really clear that we don 't want that group cursing it tag I think it 's the young the report yesterday and basically get past exactly the resolution also i commissioned to what country are so these are the totals line between it doesn 't exclude obviously it 'd be one of those times how we go again and emotion doing whatever that we just covered so how much esters cost right to date how much has this process cost today yeah I think few hundred thousand but I just the other question I had was um what it was it is there was a brief reference and 3.3 that was presented to the Hagley pyramid community board I don 't know about food with Pegasus okay can I just clarify then that um if I can 't one so if we don 't want the tidal barrage barrier to go ahead for all sorts of reasons do we vote for 5.1 odors 5.1 just put it into another process for consideration because I 'd like today to actually buy against going ahead with a total barrage based on the information we 've got in the concern from the community it does he if I may I lived open to another time and process obviously in the wording at the stage and then under that program so you I can see what yani is getting it up its the doors to like them the subsequent council yeah that 's right and I mean if the if the you know the thing is is that you know the technology changes all the time I mean I 'm not in favor of a title barrier i think it 's think it 's um it 's yeah willing nature to do something that will completely ignore and i just think that that there are too many environmental risks to the to the ester e to the city it creates a false sense of security and there are a whole lot of reasons that i could give as to why i don 't personally think that we should proceed with a title barrier but we actually haven 't had a a feasibility study onit prepared we 've had a pre-feasibility study and that says to me that we do not proceed to a full feasibility study and that 's what we 're voting on today this is my children 5.1 we 're just taking it out of one program and we 're leaving it open for others six months for me we want other cracking jokes oh well order the program when it come to does not from the hague screw optimization a number of programs each and that this match into the schedule anization is named budget yeah so that 's another problem that we 've got so um so issues the horizontal destruction groovetown providing bolton small amount of money and now really dealing with them in the land range area repairing broken salt water pipes almost at sort of the bow sir is not for blood banks and things like that which is part of that residential ribs are you we 're going to look at their whole picture what is the best solution you know everything 's up in the air for that second part of that solution first we this does it stops the work that we 're doing we will assume commitment they 're clocking up to 200,000 rounded Walton but there 's no money really soon I don 't you speak events of a mirror I just I just what I 'm concerned oh look look look take out the woods lane drainage recovery program I just want to get on with it a full feasibility study does not proceed at the stage not proceed noting feedback from a range of organizations that did not support a call feasibility sorry yep that would be good right right I shall put that motion all those carried thank you right _"

    "text": "welcome good morning too many people go the wrong way down one-way streets we need to put warning lights on the back of the runway light and sections there have been many near misses in people killed unfortunately I know the two people that were in the mage X 's on Salisbury and Durham street three weeks ago unfortunately one of them passed away and the other person is recovering that obviously there 's a very long way I started a petition a better week after the accident and I currently have 1203 supporters i also have a support letter from the higley fury mean community board as well um myself I don 't know about any of you have you have suffered a tragic loss to homicide I 've suffered two one was a family member and then this one was to extremely close friends that I 've known for a very long time obviously there is a cost involved I have looked into there and the approximate cost to do all the intersections in Christchurch is approximately about to 2.7 million i would like to present the petition people in Christchurch people from overseas and people from all over New Zealand obviously my aim is to get this up and running hopefully with the support and Christchurch but then widen that to all of New Zealand to hopefully avoid any other family having to go through what these families have had to suffer thank you thank you I certainly would like to see this petition referred to our infrastructure transport and Environment Committee so that we can get some staff reporting on it and obviously invite people to make submissions on it obviously this overseas experience that we could draw on there 's these probably issues around different parts of the country that we could draw on a certainty would want some advice from the Transport Agency so there 's a lot of a lot of players involved I 'm not going to pretend it 's not a significant amount of money because it is 2.7 million represents what on rates three quarters of one percent so just under one percent of rates which is a significant you know amount of money so other ways of funding it well so there 's lots of different things that we 'd want to look at but we really appreciate and you know recognize that tragic circumstances have brought you here but appreciate the fact that often that 's what it takes to to raise in a show and to and to make meaning of tragedy so has anyone got any questions that they 'd like to ask Pauline when you looked at postings I know they probably lord were there any solar options and their word on something he might be achieved us all watch it is this option so the initial price is 10,000 pure light and it 's I 've added the 5,000 obviously for installation to account for that as well all right I mean there is through my fatna called RTL who currently does all the signers and there that we 're currently using through the rebuild and Christchurch okay let 's really interesting because what we could you know you don 't have to do the whole lot at once you could start a priority list for hips and use our way through than perhaps intersections and others did you know thinking all right so um well I 'd like to to move that the petition be referred to the infrastructure transport and Environment Committee whether what well whether staff report and and also advice from the New Zealand Transport Agency or that would that make sense including advice from a New Zealand Transport Agency it would is it them or of the Ministry of Transport better it doesn 't matter I 'm not don 't know why I 'm looking at here yeah yeah yeah that 'll pick it up and cadets reports also include maybe suggestions or a list of priorities of those intersections etc so you know we know that we 're going through a huge change with their one-way systems and eroding in the central city and you know what I think that whether it 's going to be part of it as well as he talked at citra I think the council actually recommended and its proposed draft said he planned that the one-way streets be got rid of all together so yeah and I 'm just significant as much would you like to stick in there yeah I mean oh happy a second there I just wanted to just rise with it we should actually include sarah or CCD a given X Israel transport plan and obviously if you think about the existing funding that we have I don 't mean just to speak very briefly to this um you know we do have budget existing budgets that are thin the plan for wayfinding in the central city or four fancy section improvement so I think we shouldn 't just think it 's an increase in rates actually there 's existing budgets that could be looked at as we go through the improvement process so I just want to make that point but I support us getting the report what the different

    "text": "recently seen on saturday at the diwali festival which was absolutely fantastic by the way Thank You Lou it 's an honor to carry your message back to the organizing community place to buy stereos I think others went as well it was just stunning they 're so before I start my submission I would actually like to make honest admission I have been following this over the live streaming and it has been a great experience and before the afternoon tea break I I think heard Vicki say that if shirish comes on time you will end sooner so I did start driving immediately but I 've been no shape because I play people go over there speaking time so my name is shirish branch may I have been a resident of Christchurch for all 14 years of my life in New Zealand I 'm a resident of a one head and have been so for over eight years it 's great to meet some new people today and reconnect with many others I know it 's indeed a privilege to be in this room and the part of have been following some of the submissions through the live streaming and it has been a learning experience i have been amazed on how the word with the smallest population has figured in perhaps the most submissions this is my first ever personal submission and I believe your last one for the day first of all I would like to comment the team which has put together the initial proposal my submission is an endeavor to further refine the excellent work which has been done by the team let me share a small personal story one of the message as I was propagating in 2013 was for the migrant community specifically to first enroll and then both in the local elections I found that many residents did not realize that they had the right and more importantly the responsibility to elect their representative some days later a friend living in a van head said that he had indeed done what I had asked him to do but was surprised to find that he had been enrolled in the Wigram electorate rather than the pendant and why Murray which I had or the election office does not care about the local wad names when they send out enrollment confirmations they only used the parliamentary ward names imagine adding Maclean 's to the above story now my submission therefore is towards this dream of having a larger participation in the elections as you know we have been suffering a downward water turn out here on here my submission is towards making it simpler and easier for the common man and to have an aligned overall system and I say overall where the local boundaries and names the same as with the parliamentary boundaries as much as we can this is not going to happen overnight in fact it will take years as this is an iterative process the initial proposal is already a big step in the right direction kudos to those involved for example I support removing parts of a one-eyed area from the previous riccarton Wigram council water I hope that the next parliamentary review will see parts of a one head which are currently under the vikram electorate moved to the island parliamentary ward where they logically belong my alignment wadd names and what boundaries the third step is beyond the purview of this specific review it will need to be addressed in the next parliamentary review my written submission is with you for whatever reasons be it population data different considerations between parliamentary and local governments or simply time if we cannot align the boundaries one hundred percent with the Parliament rewards we must at least ensure that the same names are used as I have marked in my submission once again thanks for this opportunity I look forward to the outcome on 20th November which hopefully will include some or all of my recommendations thank you thank you very much I must admit that we 're sitting up here and I 'm going this is the you know the most clear-cut simple solution three for each of the parliamentary boards plus 14 thanks Peninsula and it just it just works on every level it would remove a lot of confusion it would just put everything in the irony is is that it 's not one of the things that we consider you know under the latest sort the boundaries that has to take into account the local government boundaries not the other way around but I really really like I really like your idea Jimmy okay sure is thank you so much you know for your the deputation waving with just me my locations would like to know because they are central carbon is actuated and okok i 'm rachael ray actually steer the difference for install a new recommendation naga from waste of the state highway you know that HR is belong to us Owen District Council rather than is the City Council and also some of the kind of the new proposed the war you know is public regarding the name in the world still started difference for instance like a horse where you know you combine that we qin a to the host wait a moment belong to sense of calmness toe toe heel toe heel and also does the the spray tan spray tan a moment 's be known to the week when belong to the Weaver and thanks kaneez nah you didn 't mention about a recipe don 't to the portal would like to consider what restructure you not just keep off because the name you know sent fight fighter than the name since you come and don 't come he 's at the same so far your point of view here look I have not analyzed each word in detail AAA and I understand that the numbers are different and the boundaries can be different I am just looking from a common man 's point of view so you know if i look at vikram for example we know dr. Megan woods is over MP you to represent that what and these community members represent that mod so it 's perfect alignment otherwise I for example I am in one council wat but another podria meet reward and that creates confusion for many people so I know it 's not perhaps possible to have one hundred percent alignment I acknowledge that as much as we can do I think we will help the democratic process thank you these two wards that a problematic for us once the cell one board which is sick powder butters and the cell and District marker area is split between the two councils as well so but apart from there it just looks looks neat yeah but I think that what what you 're sort of identifying is is that if we can make things as similar as possible then it also makes things easier for people to participate which is also one of the things that we should be taking into account does anyone got any questions no so last but definitely not least thank you very much it has been an honor yeah no thank you very much and thanks for putting the effort on _"

    "text": "ah good afternoon madam chair and councillors I come here today as an individual because I believe that the proposal before you is fundamentally flawed and it 's anti-democratic I 'm not going to quote Petronius but I will go back to the American Revolution which was the forerunner really of our modern democracies and it 's based on two principles and that is accountability and transparency and this proposal will mean there will not be accountability and transparency in the community boards at present and i 'll just take record and Wigram as an example of the community boards the two City counsellors are voted for by all the people living in the community board area no matter where the two councillors lived themselves they represent the whole of record and Wigram they are therefore accountable to the whole of record and Wigram who vote them in the same with the five elected community board members no matter where they come from they represent the whole area and are answerable to the whole area the advantage of the prison system is that board members are forced to work together for the benefit of the whole area because they have to go back to the voters to be re-elected under this proposal let 's play cricket and Wigram again the people that represent a narrow Ward like riccarton will can be outvoted in the community board because two of the groups on the community board can join together to our vote the Riccarton counselor and the Riccarton community board members I believe this will lead to factions I will leave I believe it will lead to our this pork barrel politics where there will be back room deals done ah I 'll vote for you the projects you want you wait for the projects we want and we have got the majority six out of nine and that 's not the way I believe a community board should work now what do make it clear that I am NOT referring here to the bank 's financial situation I 'm referring to the community boards as they exist now it is in my opinion really important that everybody on the community board is accountable to all the people in the whole there 's another issue with the City Council situation at present okay these boards had two councillors if one is sick if one is on leave if one goes AWOL there 's another one that the the residents and ratepayers can turn to for assistance and continue working until the other gets back on board under the proposed system you 're going to have one council working by himself or herself trying to persuade a majority of 15 other counselors to come on board and I think that 's just going to add to the burden that councillors already have trying to get a job done and I think this is not going to be good it 's really concerned to me to that there 's a huge elephant in the room and that is conflict of interest okay legislation says you can put forward a proposal but really unless a person the clears categorically that they will not be standing for a community board or the city council it makes it really difficult to look at this objectively and dispassionately in my view really that position of mare is proposal and we have already seen our tabloid media and christchurch i start playing this game of you know political fight for life all these two people are going to square off against each other and such and such award without any of the important issues being addressed namely democracy and transparency matter men are so those are my major concern that is that at present we 've got a good system working in in our community board the chairperson the deputy chairperson they are accountable to everybody in record and Wigram no matter where they come from and what you know political grouping they may espouse but under this new proposal that 's not going to happen because the two elected board members for all spooked riccarton or won 't be very answerable only to the people who vote them in and I don 't think that 's good for democracy maybe let me put it back to you in a different way so how about we we characterize the role of the counselors as representing around the table with the influence obviously of the area that they come a whole when they sit around this table they they put aside the the you know the personal issues obviously there formed because they represent a particular area but in terms of their overarching role like for example when we did the long term plan we all talked very you know carefully about not not pushing our own barrows or not pushing a particular issue but actually thinking of the city as a whole I 'm aware of that ma 'am Amir because you take an oath to that effect absolutely yes but this isn 't the same situation as the community board what you 're doing under this proposal is causing what happens or could happen in theory on the council now on to the community board and it 's pushing further and further away direct accountability you keep taking it one stage backwards this is a step backwards what about halls war who don 't feel that they have a voice you know a growing area it 's part of your ward recordarme Graham you know that I 'm just reflecting on what was said there 's no the highest density population in Christ you it does have the highest easily pop and as collagen has reminded counselors are numerous occasions since we 're very 2011 the population has escalated and if you you know if anybody doesn 't doubt if anybody doubts us come for a walk with me and deliver some use letters in our area and see how many thousands of litter boxes there are simply in the central record on which is quite a narrow area quite a small geographical area so you know um Yanni you think you um thank you for your submission I was interested if you will compile when they had the old record in Ward and the old would reward my impression from that time and I was elected to a community board for the hague reward didn 't join the pyramid but was that there was a different feeling about local governance the city was recognized internationally through bertelsmann has been one of the best governed cities in the world local communities felt they had much more accessibility to their community words and proper resourcing to get things different picture of when you have two or three separate Ward 's making up a community board that 's going to have a negative consequence and I 'm really interested in just understanding reflecting on whether city has come from as to why that might be the case because my impression was previously when we had small awards and more local accountability that we actually had a bit of a moment city and if you take for example when councilman from 24 to 12 the reduction in standing committees in fact no Finance Committee and then you look at some of the issues around loss of consenting the insurance etc etc so I 'm just interested in new views on that given well well obviously are much older than you and I go back to the time when there was a record in Borough Council and the y Mairi County Council and I challenge anybody in this room to ask people who have lived in those areas at the time all of them will say things were much better under a written Borough Council and the wine marin county council make it you know the principle of subsidiarity that 's you know spouse in the european union and that decisions are made at the most local level then why if you 're going to have 16 Ward 's Catholic like I 'd you have been 16 community boards I don 't mean a whole be a rock receding with them but you know they share a bureaucracy with other community boards and then the decisions would be made at the local level and you possibly add the best of both worlds where you had what you 're describing plus in our regional in this case christchurch city system that deals with larger issues rather than the watch I 'm ref and then Jimmy yeah thnkx on that point so what would you make of a system where the community board members were elected out of their community board areas so that the distinct wards but the counselors were elected out of the community board area with that so you 'd actually have the I guess that the local representation coming out at the ward level but the councillors coming out you 're totally so let 's say you 've got six councillors being elected by the whole only population know the whole of the community board whereas the community board members being elected out of the individual Ward 's within the community board yes well no siree councils then would be accountable to that other yeah the whole communities in what area like your eyes that you 've got a situation where you 've got six people who aren 't so you 've got effectively a majority who aren 't accountable to the whole area you know I think our ward you know works well I think it 's really good having a chairperson and a deputy chair who are accountable to everybody rather than just representing a narrow focus and they 're going to have to represent that narrow focus because they have to go back to the voters in that narrow area to get reelected notice since the personal my thing thank you is a good Jimmy yeah just one question you know because the current leader cast is a lagger Victor whooping communipaw and also vixen week to the proposed the communal Bowl consists of three small world but the consulate work alone in the chemical workload actually still difference also communipaw on behalf no poker community but cancer not only on behalf of local community but also not to be kind of citywide to play a governance or make a decision so do you think regarding boy you know electic an account detective still the same or not oh you you agree you know even come here for like a whole square area you may have to focus on horse where were the local issue look we in our wood we 've had people elected a different political persuasion we 've had people that are independent and with a people leather sort of part of political briefing and they have to work together and we 've got a board that had summer been elected under a name and others are independent there are strong people independent and probably in other words even stronger people that are independent you say in it people i have to work together and that 's for the best but when of _''_825.329 to City Council 's only have to deal with they live in others under this system one city council 's got to deal with 15 others and I don 't think that 's practical in the modern world I mean this is not just big Dunedin is it this is christ church under extraordinary circumstances and I 'm really alarmed to read in the New Zealand Herald this morning and I suggested you 'll have a look at this online where one political party has got tired of people I thought were members of the party voting independently and they are now going to set up a party and drag with a different name of course because they don 't want the national brand affected and in order to drive through party policies and I 'm concerned that this could happen here with 16 people and people working by themselves effective or Kevin to it by themselves it 's going to be doggy dog here because of the voting system and I don 't think that 's good for the city bhai not a community boarding no well that 's much for your interest and also for making the effort to come along and and submission of really appreciate it and now I 'd like to invite sure _"

    "text": "good at night I just like to make it clear to the representation review panel that I have been very happy with what we 've already have the fact we have our 7th ward system has been a very pleasing system to work with but I 'm also very concerned at the fact that we are considering this proposal with the fact that at a time potentially two months before an election this document could still be being considered in court according to your timetable at the front and therefore what on earth are we doing considering an initial proposal only one year out from the next election statutory time frame this decision well I think it 's something regardless it really leaves me with concern that an issue like this should be something the council should be talking with others at a high level about and be discussing it in the maybe year after the last election was helped and so on so that it always occurs on that basis for maybe a six year review and that 's why I put my first comment in there but I because of the timing it will have so it to be put into action if it was still being argued at the highest level 28 October next year that 's very short time for it to be turned over to practicality the second thing is I 'm very happy with the seven community boards and I would be very concerned if it was reduced to fight it only means a large area for people to work with and I really feel that when I go to a community board where there are two boards working to Ward 's at one ward I get a far better hearing and I do think that they are also more focused on the area of community that you 've got because that 's what your plan shows and I do think therefore that to have three wards represented by one community board is just not on and i feel that is a very poor step backwards i feel that is the real crux of what i wanted want to say to you on things there but you you were also saying earlier as the that you were receiving on this issue well if only a hundred or so of us have been putting into submissions out to 400,000 people in this city is that really justification to go and change everything because at least when we were talking about the buses they got 2569 and that 's was I thought a very good level of submissions that he can got I think that number you you tell us you 've got it 's very very low to justify change and I mean it takes me back madam chair to one statement that was made a couple of thousand years ago which you will need to think of the gentleman said this we trained hard and as soon as we formed up into teams I was told we were going to be reorganized I was to learn later in life that we tend to meet every new situation with reorganization it is the most wonderful method for creating the illusion of progress while doing nothing more than creating demoralisation inefficiency and confusion and caius Petronius the Roman soldier who said that I think sums up make change because I don 't think for instance the way the ward nap is drawn for surely avenue e butchering the likes of yannis electorate and area he represents his Wars taking them into the surely papanui area it really shows justifiable change and thought about where people who are currently represented by him are to be represented from elsewhere and those people up there are a totally different group of people in the surely papanui area than to attach them thank you on to that area Hadley ferry me I know from the people i work with on the disability community side of things i treat in a very different way and with a totally different level of thinking than people up in shirley papanui or people invent and the idea that the map of Pendleton ward you go through this narrow little gap and look at it on there that narrow little gap over there that looks like a funny dogs head does it are they really Pendleton people who are they really on that map and how does that justify really should it not have been more common sense area and these whole maps i think really need rethinking again thank you so you would be in favor of retaining the wards that we 've got that requires the local government commission to be satisfied that we 've properly considered the position of the disparity on banks peninsula so banks furniture is way outside the ten percent deviation and we 've been directed from previous decisions to have a good look at it and you 're saying that we 've had a good look at it doesn 't work leave things as they are well madam chairman how can you ever change the likes of banks peninsula because it is a small number of people living over there like you have in various places like I lived in North Canterbury there you have clusters of people living and naturally with all of the hills over there how can you guarantee that the people on banks peninsula are going to get the same level of service and support or need what is say being offered to sumner or being offered to people in New Brighton it 's one has to think about the fact that they are a smaller community and I know of people who live over there who have said to me there happy and they just hope that they don 't get their ward butchered around but the point that I 'm making is that the local government Commission has told us that we have to look at it because the disparity is so great we are way outside the team percent limit and when we go into the city this is the impact of it so what you 're saying is that and I 'm asking you a question we want you want us to say to the local government Commission we 've tested what happens to the rest of the city when we pull banks peninsula across the hills it doesn 't work leave it as it is I would think that you that that might be the best answer possible right because I do do not feel that looking at these plans in the as this is the initial proposal anyway and so that does not mean to say because it no and that I mean that dog 's head controlling be taken out of the fennel t 'en war and but once you get numbers once you pull numb because you might call it a dog 's here but it 's actually people living there and once you play around with the numbers you get into the ten percent problem I think both you and I haven 't been worked in the political area know exactly what we do with numbers when we start to talk about electorates and everything we 're doing exactly the same thing here we have to some stage have various sizes of of wards and various sizes of community areas that the law says we can 't deviate from the ten percent under and over you know unless we 've got a very good reason the only area we 've got a very good reason as banks don shula well then I I still don 't think that we need to chop it and change it because as I sent you very simply at the beginning I am very happy with the representation that we it 's been laid out and I think that should be said to the local government Commission there does come a time when you do have to say to people leave things alone yeah right okay just quickly term an infill um big fella meet those girls of talking numbers you mentioned-- with the best consultation just over 2,000 people and you thought that was a good representation our Stafford has been said by many that came here have done an incredibly good job with regards to the information of this they 've worked with between 3,000 people and with those two or three thousand people to get the submissions that we have could that not be read is a good reflection on the good work that was done by that staff and the majority of the people are are okay with what 's been proposed I 'm only following back with what I said to you what was published in the papers and what was published on the radio that the council at the time when I was preparing this document said they had only received 34 more submissions we spoke to thousands of people and that 's the point that Tim 's making then yes but that 's one thing that you can always say and should always be said as well that you have spoken with with thousands of people it might give a better view to the public than the constant comments that I was hearing from people that well if you 've only received 30 submissions what 's the worth of changement we really it 's the other can I just say that there was a submission before afternoon tea from halls walk saying if we lift it as it is at the moment they would feel left out that is an area of high growth they believe that their population has increased significantly since the since the two thousand thirteen cents us by which we measure the the mesh blocks and the challenges and the halls wall area they feel would be left unanswered if we left things as they were so maybe there 's a in between point of view where we could leave things as they were but perhaps look at maybe world well madam chairman just final answer you you and I as I said before we all know that every so often things like this have to be done just because a just because boundaries for numbers are moved doesn 't basically mean to say that you have to reduce say seven community boards 59 yeah so we can we can look at that but thank you very much it 's much appreciated the time that you 've taken to come on and make your submission thanking you right so we 've got _"

    "text": "welcome thank you and start whenever you feel comfortable thanks for the opportunity to come here today and I live within the four avenues so I 'm in Central Ward of they need for 28 years so I got a little bit of history and we 've been really well represented by the hague Lea Ferran made community board in the past they 've been really great and does not say that I think my submission was trying to suggest that we have a central city and the grouping of wards should echo that and that you have a central central hub area and then we sort of the setting sort of radiates out from that thinking the grouping of the wards should should kind of match that so to group my ward central with pepper noe in marshland is nowhere near it but if you groped us with central with Lynwood and lost and then that would give you the sink a sort of more central hub for award and central for a community board and then the rest of a sudden kind of could radiate out and the already have history in that direction heading east and that 's that 's worked well the other reason I don 't like grouping then grouped with Kavanaugh en masse lenders we do not have a common border with mushrooms and that is the only grouping that doesn 't have one of tho a common water I think that 's quite important because yeah nice to have a connecting fence between neighborhoods between neighbors the other thing I just like to say is that the central city is supposedly supposed to go to thirty thousand dollars 30,000 people yeah so it would it would be a good idea to kind of future proof for their nicest beach so that makes six years time we don 't have to you know there 's not not a lot of costs and money and associated and trying to read jag it all again so maybe having a smaller central hub war community board with three small smaller area hubs awards already would be that process could follow along a lot more simply and the later of you when the central city contains 30,000 people for horse well as well human have fast it 's growing yes so your preference is to go with the areas that you 've traditionally been aligned with and differently you don 't want anything to do with Shirley moshlings here um well it 's just there what we 've got some other issues I guess within and we are smaller sections smaller hair older houses we have that kind of some sort of look and yeah so that that would be my preference and I think perhaps you need to think about this review as being an intermediate state step between the next one when the central city will contain a lot more population okay thank you other any questions guys Wendy this is the dreaded surely don 't make seedless that 's not the question I 'm just for you done that you 've done it really looks really good and quite innovative so thank you thank you and also do you see bbm is like a boundary between author or a division between say the central city in the northern part of the city as like a uses it but we took a lot of Sun Auburn stitch there 's similar to seem to leave all our houses and older houses so I think they had similar kind of us uses us and so no I don 't think it needs to be a boundary but it is always seen as a down Ruth but you 're not supporting the north side of not sponsored Albans being kind of central or just popping over you know nice seem to take some quiet it 's just unreason always getting this for you yeah ok nobody else ok thank you very much indeed thank you for _"

    "text": "int it welcome in in submissions on page 154 although obviously much but sinners he 's going to tell us now yeah yep welcome in thank you again for letting me come along here today kind of the most welcome anytime yeah so God my submissions been written down there and I before I start I just want to say my number ten on my my sheet and the littles and some of the community board now I wrote my submission at the last minute which may be that Cleveland they were the hen rock the grammar and stuff but I have changed my mind because I misread the numbers and look in that wood and I had the summer subsection as the is the total population hat so I no longer believe that although I think there 's a slight disproportionate representation in that ward and towards a little tin rather than something that 's the only thing I 'd say on there on that so I generally support this I am the 16 board model and eggy am or exit em or actually bigger one but the major the representation because by Selah single will models to our closer to you representation now I said my submission i have previously stood for chili pepper new community board and i found that really hard to get round and while i was campaigning around the whole ward to talk to people and people who lived out in belfast didn 't actually associate they were in chili pepper nuit so smaller smaller areas to represent I thinkers is a very good move I also and as in my submission mentioned that there 's a with the version first-past-the-post_:_138.85 we have in the council where you click to two counselors for award there is a tendency to block vote so I think less so on the last council election but if you go back over the history there is a quite common pattern where someone and they 're running mate ends up being elected so you get bloc voting amongst people and in some cases they could have only been a few hundred votes between the third-place person at the second place person a third place person and you ended up with of one the previous election but I won 't dwell on which one it is and and if we were to go to that the council would have to move to east TV voting like they do in Dunedin or willington if you won 't want to do the multi the multi young member woods and the the other thing is that as I mentioned earlier the naming of places if you 're going around and you 're representing surely pepper nuit and which was the ward that I was standing in for the community board last time well the boundaries that actually moved in chili pepper new he said large swaths of pepper knew you weren 't in pepper nuit and little bit too surely went in paranoid but Belfast was so I think the name I I suggested Sir namings for the community boards by to represent that their parts of Christ chips like Eastern Christian southern Christchurch I think that people identify would not employ more than that I think you have the same problem with the wards and and and how you split them that people pepper nuit being being the award I don 't think there 's a way to fix these problems but I just what to your attention and the other thing that I think I just put on the sheet and as that I 'm that were some of the wards some of the large Awards there i was looking at marstons was contained Preston 's is likely to be a ward where the populations likely to increase faster than say and one was then then then the pepper new award next to that so I i think by bought by the split that that 's done there you are likely to when you next every review you you 're going to have to do some significant boundary changes least so with the smaller size of the central population because I do hope people will move into the central question again at some point and but definitely in some of those out awards with with new subdivisions are going on and I did also mention the sort of division in of surely of them st. Albans between the central and the pepper will make some submissions on that so I haven 't bonded too much detail that 's why I 've got to say thank you very much any questions felt Thank You Ian and so basically one of the things it sounds like you would support the single member wards because at work in one area you referred to was a distinct difference really between Papa Noah 's award and ensuring summer right that I don 't think this there 's not much difference there but I think there 's a the will surely paranoia yeah i live on when my turn smaller than the other so it 's it is it isn 't that much different but I 'd say when you get further out to them towards casebook and problems they are quite different to leave those are the city suburbs so the other thing to picked up from you as a former Canada is that when it comes to your sort of exercising your democratic rights and putting forward in fact for you to stand it is much easier and more workable to stand in one wards well people are going to me you also are more likely to know your population or where you live all boundaries always yeah it 's always difficult because I live saw them on the edge of a boundary so some of the people live not far for me XD couldn 't close me and and so when you refer to two difficulty getting around the area I presume you 're so mean such such a larger combined more difficult you right thank you I 've got its calm quiet after lunch there 's none ok thank you very much indeed _"

    "text": "come and sit down here and make yourself at home this is on page 151 submission and welcome and we 're completely in your hands you 've got 10 minutes I think to do what you will with thank you and yes look I don 't have a copy of the total of all of the submissions in front of me but I don 't think it made us too much anyway look I 'm here on behalf of myself and also the Phillips town community I 've been speaking with me rien just regarding the boundary sources or an email sorry came through from the neighborhood watch and so I said I 'll put a submission and to support that they wanted the boundary change so I don 't know whether Marianne is here today or not yeah that 's right so I 'll just read the the bottom part of my submission really so philipstown is a well-established historic community whose borders a Fitzgerald kettle or wounds road and fury roads however the new boundaries proposal puts the border between Linwood ward and the woolston Lord along Sherman this potentially will have an adverse and unfair effect on our representation we ask therefore that the border between these two wards be moved to or northwards from chums street and Harrow streets to casual street to properly reflect our suburb we have a natural fit with walleston and with the closure of the philipstown school our children now go to t Walker which is the Walston school and we also consider that in this current post-quake or eliminate there it would be in the phillips town 's best interest to be in the Wolfson ward so that 's what they 're that submission is there really just to support that boundary change so they can be included and the air does their concern there that that you separate the community and as I 've said in mine and eventually you know it 's like who takes responsibility for the the issues that need to be dealt with and you know you kind of divide people up and there 's nothing left after a wee while so that was really the point of the submission and in terms of the 'll get it do i think that the community of interest will be fairly represented represented by the proposed number of councillors wards and community boards well I guess that 's as put I disagree there I 'm really there honestly I don 't know the answer to that that will really come down to what the actual results are you know how the boards work together with the communities and in terms of that and I guess it 's I suppose it 'll be a bit of a trial and error thing to see but my main concern and for the the community as well and I 'm also a member of crime watch I 've been pepper nuit the community patrols the you know we have crime here in Christchurch we also have corporate crime so on myself and I 'm with them also is looking at standards within the community so my hope is that the the community boards will at least give the opportunity for communities to come forward with actual ideas that can really solve some of the issues that need to be addressed them if local government and you know the government in general can to solve what needs to be obviously solved on a permanent basis within weird you know coming forward with standards of our own to be able to to do something about the issues that need to be addressed so we do hope that yes we can do that within the wards and the boards of the you know of the council and it will be great if we could work together to really resolve and find solutions for the issues that really need to be addressed you know not just to keep the status quo going you know proper permanent solution that 's what we 're looking for and we 're going to make sure that that happens and I do hope this the boards any any awards all divided up there you know work for us to do that because at the end of the day that will know by looking at the results we 're going to be a lot more focused in terms of what are the goals of the community what are the goals in as you know residents and citizens and business owners and everybody else how can we work towards having a better society for all of us you know we want to do we have a right to you know to love them to be loved with well-being and safety and security happiness and you know we can look at hopefully this is a way to address some of those issues that are not being addressed yeah and that 's all I need to say thank you indefinitely this makes sense to me keeping in with a spirit of that peeping keepin people together remove that boundary for those people philipstown that want to to be included with woolston they have a very good reason for doing so and i think i do hope that will will come about that 's all anybody doesn 't actually thank you for taking the time to make a submission air to comment as well other in questions of Lisa alright see you 're just so clear Victor your submission is incredibly clear so thank you very much indeed and thank you for taking the time you thanks and _"

    "text": "if Jim 's not here he comes later we 'll just take him a bit later enter me that leaves us with you mr. remor his ass the rumor was on page 143 welcome nice to see you here as well right we 're in your hands Anthony has to speak to you know how to do this completely or wouldn 't go that far this is only the second time I 've ever done a submission to counsel so what 's twice a year so unless here we go well thank you for the opportunity to present my submission on the representation review I want to make a couple of points today the first one well they 're both hopefully quite simple first of all I am in favor of options which devolve as much responsibility and authority as possible to the local community our three yearly horse races be at the nationwide government or local body representation is a vital part of democracy but i think the foundation of a true democracy is power of the people by the people and for the people that old-fashioned notion which that 's actually best done when and where decision-making powers devolved as closely as possible to the local community and for that reason that was my submission stated my preference for the 19 councillor single Ward and eight community board model I believe it provides the best direct access for local communities to their elected representatives for me the 19 councillor single would model in particular brings us much more in line with nationwide averages for representation and I think the more direct and intimate access to a counselor and board member that an individual and her community group has the more empowered I believe she bows feels and in fact is now better ratios of representatives to people doesn 't always guarantee quality engagement but I believe it certainly enhances the opportunity for dead and the more I see my counselor and the community board members being accountable to my local community the more engaged I wish to become and I suppose the jury of this process is that different views come and I happen to believe quite the reverse of the previous of matter there in fact smaller and more representative because by nature your connect the people from an area and you 're seeing it that 's the first part of in the comments I got in there are already there I don 't propose to get into any detail today I guess my second point that I want to make is to take a moment actually to do something which may be rather boring to some but that is actually to thank the council and the counts of staff for the quality of work that 's actually gone into this particular process I happen to believe that there 's been an awful lot of of engagement certainly prior to these coming up and I want to acknowledge the validity of the primary option even though it 's not my preferred one the 16 council a single Ward said and community board option the nature of the submissions process means that most people come and rightly so to present their alternatives to what has been proposed as indeed I have briefly done I think the risk with that of course is that somehow to often the impression has been put in by staff and council as fundamentally flawed now of course that can be so sometimes even with the best staff and the best intentions proposals can see the light of day that in hindsight should have remained fully closeted away and my first submission as far as I 'm concerned related to one of those but we 're not here to read about that but in fact that 's not always the case or even often the case I don 't want to go to on record today saying that in this instance I want to commend the council and its staff for all that are seeking to achieve in this process no doubt that there are some specific boundaries that people will wish to see moved and no doubt questions around the representation of the banks peninsula community which has already been mentioned they 'll continue to exercise your collective minds and of course no doubt those like me who prefer another model will continue to push for that that is as it should three that 's democracy at work and in my case for of the 19 counts the model that I prefer is the higher costs a real difficulty in a time of tight financial constraints and already significant rate rises and we 're wanted you to be asking you that question of hope you just answered it for you because I know that that 's one of the issues that people have raised with it but the joy this process I think is that people get to bring those and to be asked questions and to debate them and there will always be competing priorities in any proposal I think the sign of a robust proposal is when people can acknowledge the rationale for decisions that have been taken even if they do not fully agree again I make my point for me I prefer the 19 counselor model I think that it 's more representative I think it is it 's better value I acknowledge the costs but also I believe that in a positive robust approach that has this one has been I believe that the outcomes are such that you can be justifiably proud of your efforts and those up to my submission and submissions of others and I 'm hopeful you see the value of an even greater increase the number of councillors otherwise I wouldn 't have come today but in this instance I 'm confident that if you choose not to amend the 16 counselor single ward of saving community board proposal in my favor so to speak you will still have come up with a model that I believe will stand our city in good stead for years to come I think you 've not allowed purely political considerations to drive your decision making but if truly sought to place the interests of the people of Christchurch to the fore so well done for what it 's worth you have actually raised the competence of this rate payer and the council and its staff through this proposal and for that I am thankful thank you very much indeed in turn a bit sloppy and other questions enjoy and thank you very much indeed for the submission now I know from the submission you are in signum do you have any view on the grouping of the area that you live in is appropriate or whether you would like to see them group differently well I mean as i said i mean my preference was the 19 and eight because i think that there was a better model in terms of the groupings i 've looked at the community boards n indeed even though my submission says i agree with the boundaries just one mine I think it 's kind of difficult because I had some agreement with them and some challenges I certainly agree with the boundaries of the nineteen ward model it made more sense to me I think there are some challenges around this at one of the risks of the seven community board model is that you are losing some of the connections in looking at the committee board model that 's here in the 16 council seven ward 1 I probably feel a little bit less connected to the community board level in my case I 'm willing to go with that if I get single board counselors because I think that 's actually a key part of it for me was Anthony so clear that there are no questions these different excellent you 've done a good job on this I have to say I 've been really impressed and I 'm not sure you always get told it so please take it away from this person for what it 's worth thank you very much and that was your ticularly for staff yeah thanks very much indeed Anthony right _"

    "text": "ref might be an apology for a wee bit of lateness and Pauline might be as well we 've got a latest well I 'm hoping it 's a wee that it certainly a wee wee bit ok so welcome back to stop Daniela welcome um have you been here for any of this tenure ok so basically you can use the time and you 've got teen Mads and whatever way you want so you can speak to your submission or you can just wait for questions or you can however you feel like yeah Don yeah that 's on as far as like Canyon heroes it goes yeah yeah I 'll just liked so few things whatever yep it won 't cure de that oh and I I 've lived in central Christchurch for about 30 years and most of those in the same lower income area towards least and prior to that had lived in other places foreign places as well as North Island and I grew up in Italy and someone else actually pointed out an article in the priests a reporting how a very low and so I made a brief submission including the only point I could comment on only a few that i felt i could comment on and I 'd like to speak to those oh I and others would have liked an opportunity to hear some debate and public meetings about this consultation to better understand the issues I spoke to a number of people around me geographically in terms of across town I spoke to a few people and the ones i SPECT felt they didn 't have enough information and no chance to ask questions or understand the reasons for the proposals and also it was pointed out to me and I 've observed at myself that many people not only in our area are still struggling through post-earthquake rebuild or repair and the flow-on effects of that many feel overwhelmed by the speed of change the lack of stability and feel other unable to fully engage in the democratic process or they feel that their views are not going to be listened to any way and some refer to previous things that have happened and very quick succession a possible reason for on paucity of submissions and it is a concern of mine that not enough people are engaging in the sort of democratic debate as regards the number of councillors I 'm fully aware of the need to limit the size of counsel for different reasons and not only for costs reason for other reasons as well workability of the committee etc but I feel the current proposal that 's to elect only one counselor Ward effectively would be a first-past-the-post system would not improve her presentation one counselor Ward would not allow for difference differences of opinion within each Ward to be represented and we need minority views not token representation from what could be easily identifiable new minority groups but we need representations representatives of ways of thinking that are different from those of the majority and if we think of Parliament as an example in Parliament we 've had valuable contributions from smaller parties made by the smaller parties whether we agree with them or not and I 'm thinking for example contributions made up by groups like the Green Party the Maori Party have made important contributions and we need those views we need to hear those views to put forward different ways of examining issues to enable more effective critical evaluation of issues and ultimately better decision making so I don 't think it would be an advantage to have 16 Ward 's as opposed to the current 7 I would like to suggest that we have few awards or stick to the current number awards and continue to elect to counselors from which ward the question about the proposed boundaries the question said specifically will the proposed boundaries reflect your community and all your communities of interest I felt that question was very important one but again I 've been unable to gather enough information to or in unable to get a sufficient discussion with others to make an informed contribution on this all I can say is that i would expect we will need a very careful detailed look at census information as well as information on current and then updated information and information on current trends in expected changes in population population movement population density and the profiles of just another small point on the issue of the proposed amalgamation of sumner and banks peninsula i can only say that I suspect there sumner which is a coastal city suburb and most of bank spanners peninsula which is made up of isolated settlements do not have much in common I don 't live anywhere near these places but from what I know of them this is my understanding and in fact may be better to have a separate ward covering what is essentially a rural area with with special characteristics that 's all I wanted to say to me thank you very much indeed in here I that was actually incredibly thoughtful thank you SVA um as the question settle Yanni thank you John what Daniel I thank you for your submission um if we stuck with the current wards and and in fact some people have said we should even go bigger and just let three counts was across that system how do we ensure that the areas the communities that have low voter turnout I represented around the council table which additionally have been those lower socioeconomic to represent which was hagley ward at a voter turnout of thirty-five percent it went from a glee park albans road when it combined with very mid ward which were from all lands road to Taylor 's mistake up through summer they had a voter turnout of sixty-five percent so the ferryman Ward basically always kind of determines who wins the election because of the voter turnout and I guess the initial fee but we head through the early engagement what we did have quite a lot of people involved was people wanted more local wards because they felt they had better chance of having local representation so to me that 's the kind of really interesting kind of question because it goes the other yeah so that I just interested in your thoughts yes it 's the low voter turnout is a huge issue in the area I lovin and thinking of the general elections rather than specifically council elections um I actually made it a little project a mind to go round asking a number of people and listening especially listening I actually heard more through listening than the growth of of the number of people who felt completely disaffected I mean that there are a number of trends that I 've noticed in our area growth of people who feel they 're foreigners and their own country I mean I 'm a foreigner and if I feel a foreigner that 's what I am I 'm Italian and I live here and I belong to this community as well for that 's where I come from but the growth of people who feel completely left behind and that 's and these are not my words feeling like a foreigner in your own country there are other people 's words in the growth of the number of people i noticed who were saying they didn 't bother voting this is again national election because they felt that the party they went voting for had already won and took me a while to understand that what they were talking about was the use of the pawls the opinion polls the way they were represented in the media and people responding to that and believing that there was so sort and a lot of other people who don 't understand what the issues are and therefore they want bother and I think whatever the size of the of the ward whether it 's small ward or a big award voter turnout is going to continue being an issue and I just think we need to really roll our sleeves up and go out there and encourage people to participate with evilly of use otherwise I know that regardless of the size of the ward will be the more affluent better educated people who will bother to turn out regardless of the size of the ward you okay think I know if that 's answered your question it was an interesting um it was very interesting anyway even if you didn 't so it 's pathetic phones got a very quick question just to clarify things but like you I don 't if you 're weird but in physical the early engagement that council did around around this was over 2,000 people made made comment so I 'm just wondering if you think it might also be possible that because in engaged that in fact and and that others might have decide look I 'm not going to need to come and talk to counselors overall I 'm relatively ok as well as it empathy that you referred to yeah well that may apply to to those or two people another bar morally speaking sure about the people that I 've been able to you talk to you okay thank you thank you very much indeed for coming and making your submissions thank you for your time thanks to know _"

    "text": "yes and I 'm David Hall welcome okay thank you and thank you for the opportunity to make a submission and speak in support of our written submission and as an association we certainly appreciate the importance of this process because it 's going to set the ground rules that we 're all going to be working under further the next little while we had a our regular meeting monthly meeting last night and one of the things that we talked about is that something that 's not really been addressed in the current proposal is the choice between a net large and award based Council and there 's a long based long-standing body of theory and local government politics around representation structure and X is that ward based councils make decisions that don 't have the interests of the whole city at heart and worse than that that the representation representatives from the various Ward 's engage in horse trading between themselves to advance their own ideas but an hour opinion this has not been the case in Christchurch and largely to this group 's credit I think from officer level have worked in the interests of the whole city and not just particular localities and there 's now a strong body of evidence coming in forward in support of the ward system especially where there 's an underpinning committee system like that that we now have in Christchurch if we think now of the size of council and community boards and its really interesting listening to them to easier to earlier submitters there 's a couple of observations that we would like to make from our submission firstly that the current number of councillors are overworked and secondly that the existing record and Wigram community board has worked well for us in hallsville in terms of overworked councillors our viewers just on our general observations it 's really hard to pin something down but it does seem to ask that it 's probably a bit of a byproduct of the midi structure that i just talked about but it 's it 's something that we really feel that counselors really do have their work cut out for them I 've got a note here that the Minister for 's good enough for us what 's I don 't think I 've seen that quote thanks I eat was quoted in the press in terms of working well and three things come to our wives our view firstly we 're able to take issues directly to the community boards through the delegation system and when we get there something that 's really important is that the board has sufficient local knowledge to know that we 're talking about an example that we would have is that there 's a long-standing need for a youth facility in balls well we 've run several delegations to community board and they know exactly where we 're coming from an executive situation we 're talking about second example of working well as that community boards are able to take care issues to council officers and get action an example here was the incomplete project at the end of Templeton 's drive where the cycle lane was covered over by Road cones for what seemed like months awaiting ceiling i emailed on behalf of halls residents association and nothing happened Debbie Mora from our where the inquiry system had failed the third example of the community board working well for us is that councillors on the community board are able to escalate issues of necessary again with all important local knowledge and an example here has been the status of toilets and causal domain where councillor chin helped out and he got an immediate answer for us from a senior council officer which was really helpful to our association as we know now submission to many community boards and the voice at council level and with council officers gets diluted to few has the potential to obscure the link with community so we think that the proposal is rounded out right in terms of boundaries as we have stated in our submission we totally agree that short hauls Walt should have its own ward a strength of the ward system as it allows local voices to be heard and because of its rapid growth in recent years and growth that is expected to continue horsell needs to have a voice to bring these growth related issues directly to the council table it 's really area of rapid growth you do tend to have more issues that crop up and these typically need political intervention a dedicated ward will help our voice to be heard but as we noted above we don 't think that this will be to the detriment of citywide decision the issue that we have with the boundaries and again this has been really interesting listening to the earlier submitters is that the proposed population size and boundary make calls for one of the biggest Ward 's on both population and area counties whereas it should be among the smallest because of the inevitable in accuracy associated with a system based on the previous census the 2013 census I 'm sure is already out of date and by the time we get to the next representation review it will be quite laughable so I know that there 's only a limited amount of slop and the system in terms of the population size that year at veer variability that you 're allowed that we think even so that our ward should be smaller not emphasized that it is so that is summarize what we 've got and an hour written submission and a little bit thank you very much Oh Jimmy thank you thank you very sure they got into the palm tree and also the smaller you persecution because those words most a faster growth a population area but yesterday and today the sum of the summation Y is regarding to the way smaller some people might suggest Jess you know to seek from the public house will walk to the kashmir war that 's the first one second is just earlier you know the people on behalf that Coover people particularly suggest the around the 60 people a moment living in Hong Kong hey but based on it based on the proposed you know in the house where whether you know to sifter to the hand of spreading war essential so what is your point of view okay so if we take the first one yeah about Westmoreland is quite interesting because when we were discussing this at our association I said oh this was my personal view I said on westmoreland out there more obviously with Kashmir ni-lewis with the Association we had comments from Westmoreland residents that they certainly did not see themselves as part of Kashmir rookie I don 't know anyone in Westmoreland who 's expressed an opinion and you 'd have to go and ask them but that was that was the view that was taken and the second one about oh yeah yeah yeah that 's that and really interesting because one of the things that 's coming up is the new as sub-divisional development at meadowlands which is on the southern side of Henderson 's road what you 're inevitably here is you got to draw a line somewhere and where that line goes I don 't know Debbie more of who 's on the community board lives on our side of innocence wrote and whether the boundary is naturally on down the middle of Henderson 's road or on the south side of Henderson 's road is dread of a hard one to judge and again I think that there are so many opinions on that that 's you know it 's hard us as an association to make a viewpoint natural dividing lines the RZA and age-related dividing line in terms of that the how long standing the particular development has been and in that regard Henderson 's road is definitely whom hey but you know when you think of what 's going to go into Meadowlands maybe they 'll turn around and look south rather than look to the center of the town to us that one of the major dividing lines as previous speakers talked about it for hip cat river another really major dividing line is actually the motorway but the motorway is you know if we chopped off on the ones that south eastern side of motorway well that would make Wilson far too small so that this whole community of interesting is it 's a bit fraught but I suppose the other thing in terms of where you know communities of interest like possible people there local high school the end zone high school is hill modern high school so people in hallsville do look toward the Hoenn high area as well so probably haven 't really answered your question but it 's s that and how you define a community of interest as is quite an interesting question but yeah thank you think it I 'm turn thank you thank you very much submission am I did talk with the chair of the wee small and residents association we want to go get a different issue but he assured me that he felt that they were halls will rather than that quiche mean saying and but there wasn 't any ruckus or anything yeah just what 's regard to the previous speakers corner of penises and sparks throw these a dogleg via with pattern it 's in hallsville and part of its or still in hallsville and I was just think of your thoughts on for open so one of the bit of time just to tidy things out that those that are inside that corner that hour and all fearful we 've heard that felt that the palatine high so they would idiot do you see an issue or a major issue with regards to just reversing that bit line you know one of the things inevitably is that in an area where has been much more in the growth areas so that established areas tend to miss a alphabet I suppose yeah and in someone speaks it you know again this is not we haven 't talked about the dog Leah get our association yeah but you can see that there 's still would be advantages with those people going with the with the hoone high side of things because of the you know they aren 't going to get the level of input probably from a more problem based approach to things where we end up going around putting out fires a lot of the time cheers thank you yeah and you raise an issue that I think is of significant importance and that 's the population basis for the ward based on the two thousand thirteen senses and the fact that Paul 's will has grown since then and actually will continue to grow on projections in terms of developments that are going to be occurring in that area and it does it does raise some issues around you know again the appropriateness of doing this at this time because be and if we 're going to be reviewing this and six years time you know we actually can do it in three years time but why would we change all the boards and then change them all again next time when we have some bitter figures I mean it 's just a it 's just a rant really I haven 't really got a question that goes with us well my I guess my response to that would be is you can 't fix things in one head no aimed and if you look at the way that the boundaries are going to be in Christchurch I think they 're going to be changing present continuous teams for the next 20 years and I think that we need to seize the opportunities that we have and certainly for the status quo I think people and also would feel very hard done by but I think one of the real strengths of the current proposal is that we do get a a local representative to bring our consents and it to the council table here so you 're you 're of the actors and isolated community and in that regard because you 're just State distance distance removed and don 't have a single representative to call your own yeah and it 's an accident of democracy at the moment but neither of the counselors counselor and councillor chin and deputy mayor back resident in our ward and yes sorry wrong way and be a part of the board they 're absolutely embedded in the ward as hell we all know there is no one who would doubt it comes in a chain and counselor but represent yeah yeah yeah my apologies with it but no yes um and I think you know in terms of community board members here be more is only in by the skin of their teeth all right an excellent of one side of the road or the other and Nike and the other community board members don 't come from horse walk and as I say it 's an incident of democracy but we do feel that that our representation has been you know it 's certainly not cast aspersions at any of these that what you 're doing is highlighting the you know the significance of the growth that 's occurring out there at a time where we 've got a structure that was designed for a for an earlier time absolutely yeah yeah i glean thank you thank you David I 've been looking into your the bullet points about whether or not we 're overworked because these a sense in which we like pushing my said and open Internet though we 've got nothing to do with the decision that we make all right then all of it the Palmerston North City Council has 15 councillors plus aamir for a population of 78,000 it hasn 't had a major event as we have so do you have any comments that compared to this proposal of 16 plus a mere 4 400 I spent about six or seven years and pounds to North other the little light-hearted comedy that I was glad to leave here that the issues that they have I think it 's kinda the issues that they have I think and some ways is quite some leather Christchurch they surprised if they needed 70 but yeah I guess it 's well I think again if we come back to what I said earlier in response to the mere you know we fix things little by little rather than heading things in one go and to me moving from 13 counselors to 16 counselors and seeing how that goes at the next representation review is a really good way of looking at it rather than necessarily going and having a look at you know places like parmesan north or wherever and seeing you know can we be guided by the so so my response to that is you know let 's ignore palmerston north and let 's sort of move things step by step with the system that we 've got right I was trying to find a way around using the two overworked so that 's why there yeah well there 's a joke that goes you know you know you from Christchurch comparison book sounds like a good idea anyway so I 'm Morgana more than farmers to North I 'll tell you that like don 't want go and I 'm sure the mirror of parvis the north will be on the photo shoot is for fun that 's what I 've seen anyway no thank you very much for your contribution it 's actually been incredibly helpful and certainly has helped me understand some issues better than perhaps I did before so that 's great thank you very much now we 're going to adjourn the meeting and _"

    "text": "Louis flowers yeah Lance 's supporting the parents know she 's good I can say good morning because it 's two minutes to midday and welcome thank you good morning me and counselors I know you 're very busy and it must be hard listening to everybody for so long I 'm a long term at resident of spreadin and I speak in favor of the 14 would model as proposed by the barrington issues group which keeps the current number of boards my reasons are that this model requires the least change it involves little cost increase it continues with the Hagley ferry mead board and wood and it is the most community friendly also the 14 ward model adheres most closely to the system we have now and to what people already know I believe that the people of Canterbury have suffered enough stressful change in the last few years after thousands of earthquakes that you all know about and the trauma involved in repairs I consider canopy people deserve to be allowed to keep as much that is familiar as possible I believe that this helps people distress some of the changes we are undergoing involve a costly rebuild with rate rises and asset sales and although the 16 would model does not involve great cost it still means increased costs in contrast I understand the 14 ward model can be made to involve few extra costs that is if community board members are reduced from five to four I note that the 16 ward model increases the number of councillors by three from 13 to 16 and incur the loss of the Hagley ferry mood board to me this is serious since it makes representation top-heavy with counselors and at the same time gives less representation to communities this together with the large number of changes toward boundaries cuts across communities of interest and destroys well established relationships and we 've already heard about this from the last two or three speakers I do not believe that additional counselors necessarily equates with more community involvement regarding boundaries the proposed 16 Ward model peeps together the communities of addington and walsim which I applaud but some of the old horn hoon hay and hillmorton are split up with halls will and hornby and may well be disadvantaged through having little say in comparison to if they were placed in one ward together similarly disadvantaged by being split up will be woolston which is partially in wis Fraden should woolston residents have an over say traffic and some of them belong to willesden Ward and the rest is Braden I think their ideas would have less clout than if they were all in one Ward together likewise hallsville Kashmir and banks financial awards Kashmir and Westmoreland have little in common with banks peninsula Horsell and should not be grouped with the either of these indeed with some small changes to boundary lines the 14 Ward model can be made to reflect community interests much more easily than the 16 Ward scheme who is to do it and how will we know if it is suitable that is another question my view is that it is best to make the health court River a clear boundary which the 16 Ward proposal does not do the city is shifting west and south as shown by the construction of a new consideration in boundary divisions and is reflected better by the 14 Ward model than the 16 ward system I understand that the aim of all this is to assist the population in general to make known their views to council and I consider the 14 Ward model with the current number of boards and 14 counselors as proposed by the barrington issues group does this best thank you very much and thank you for coming on if it you 've heard me sort of say today that you know if we one of the drivers one of the significant driver is the bank 's financial being so far out of the ten percent range if we were able to resolve that would you support us just retaining our current boundaries for another tomb and doing this and the next term you know good I mean currently as you pointed out we 've got 13 councillors we 've got community boards which people have spoken extremely highly of you I mean I write down one of your statement security in times of distress keeping things the same helps people deal with if we were able to persuade the local government commission that the bank 's financial award could stay the same that actually the rest of the city could stay the same and we could do this again with much deeper involvement um you know it 's only a hundred less than 200 submissions I think had come through which seems very few compared to you know I mean watch of you on there that would keep it at thirteen plus the mere I understand that this would require a change of law no no it would just simply require the local government Commission to accept a submission from us that it be rolled over I think that would be very good I think one of the reasons for the apathy at the moment is because people who have just had too much to cope with and really they can 't cope with anything more I myself found this very hard to get my head around and without Maps two or three maps and I was lost oh you 've done amazingly wow did think you do does anyone have any Jimmy as all right Thank You Lars and thank you very much you 're considered an articulate submission I 'm following on from what the mayor said and also the theme of your submission do you feel the current system n provides you an adequate way to meaningful engage meaningfully engage if there are issues which which come up to you because we obviously want to be able to be responsive and we here for the residents do you find that there is the current system allows for you to meaningfully engage in the democratic processes I think that people just don 't know how to get in touch with community boards and I feel that a lot of education is needed and it 's good that we have these small Bruce like we 've had the hillmorton group we 've heard from the Summerfield group today and I I have gone along to the Barrington issues group and that 's how I 've learnt and if people don 't know to do this or they don 't know that they can interact with the community boards they just don it easy for them as well I think that irony is is that the people that were very engaged and what was you know a process that we 've received a lot of compliments from I should say that people have come and made submissions and said you know the process has been really great because we 've gone out and we 've engaged with people but the people that we 've engaged with haven 't necessarily made submissions because this isn 't as you say an ideal process you know it 's the process that we have and it 's the one that we have to work with but you know as you say epithelia veering but just having too much on our plates yes that 's that is my feeling yeah yani thank you for your submission we we had a lot of early engagement and we you know I think over 3,000 pieces of feedback and I guess you know we 've heard that people there 's been some comment that say people just too busy but do you think is also a group of people that initial proposal and therefore haven 't bothered to make submissions I couldn 't speak for them I don 't know I 'd be making assumptions if I agreed with you maybe maybe they just got lost and something else I find that 's what 's happens to me I 'm interested in something then other things come up which a higher priority and so I have to engage with them and leave the other well I think we 've been extraordinarily lucky to have you present to us today so thank you very much for taking the trouble and yeah making the contribution that you 've made thank you very much good you good yeah _"

    "text": "sorry missus having brought together a large number of people to so much thank you for doing there thank you for taking the time to UM to listen that 's I 'm quite overwhelming to see you all here um my name is Susie sarah and i live in hoon hay and had done so for the last 19 10 years i lived there with my husband Peter and my three daughters one is 8 1 is 6 and 1 is 4 and and I 've got a real heart for community I grew up in a rural area and and in that rural area people got along and helped one another and you know I knew as a kid I needed to be good in front of everybody not just my own parents because I 'd get it tell enough from anyone and and just that love and connection and sense of belonging that being part of a community is is really really strong in my heart um and so it 's worth that that passion for community that I have been investing in the last 10 years in a number of different liberals the first way was just Pete and I moving into the area and saying this is our home this is where we belong now and then our church Southwest Baptist started making communities and the actual geographical area our focus of where we would serve and and commit to and where we could actually demonstrate Jesus 's love for the community and so in that we 've got a group of 42 maybe 80 people that go to the church that are hoon hay residents and amongst that group we have people that live in the north and the south of hearne hey and also at the start of this year phase work met with people to start a Residents Association for who night and it was through that that I realized that the boundary that was being put forward was right through sparks road and right through half of whom he 'd live in live in the south although the hell end of hoon hay the radio Street the Kawara area that little pocket separated and then it came to our attention that there attached to this geographical area like the spread and hillmorton shopping center type area so I thought well that 's not going to be great if we want to to represent our community to have it separated like that a little bit like Trish just said to have to have residents association that looks after a whole community that is n 11 board in one area with one counselor as ideal so I facilitated a couple of meetings and and have I guess hood opinions from a variety of different perspectives and I put those in this admission I 'll just briefly cover them but basically there was a group of people from the south of hoon hay who felt concerned about this we pocket being isolated from horse wall but being put in with that that would especially as horse was growing and and they don 't particularly identify with whose well they identify more with the barrington site and in the school community also has people in that hoon hay area that are all clumped together we had one jolly person who seemed to think it would be they 'd rather face the city but that make it work either way there was people from hillmorton who felt they were quite separate from the aiding field area that they were being being put with with this proposal and that they identified with the whole morton shops the Lincoln Road area the local school the whole morgan hi they felt that they she had more in common with whom hey and so would like to stay as part of that area and then there was people on the Hendersons road and sparks corner urea who who felt there was just so much growth in pressure and horse all these people actually currently are part of the horse will area but they would like to see themselves and become part of tune hey because they said there 's so much growth and pressure and hulls wall that they feared that hoon hey people would lose their voice and I guess the one interesting thing that one of the couples brought up was that they 're currently in the halls reward and Henderson 's road has cut halfway through what sort wrote it road end and they their gutters different that the new guttering got put in have you know partway down but the apart has not been put with new gutters and so they have to on a regular basis taking it upon themselves to ring the council to ask them to come by and actually clean them properly because other big deep gutters so they just you know we just feel like we have been a little bit let down and lift out and we just want to come back into what we see as our community in an addition to that there was the school perspective wanting to keep that community together hoon high school as the only body or organization that holds the hoenn a name and and the students come from from the south as well as the north of whom hey so that 's yeah that would be our ideal situation is to keep keep hillmorton and hoon hay all tequila would be a really really beneficial thing for our community especially for the residents association just starting out it 'll help keep things clearer it or a positive person is probably better with um would make it work either way that efforts possible and we 'd like it to be squeaked around a little bit so you 'd rather look to having a single community board really to engage with ya and end us although you could have a single community board but be split across two councillors which might give you two for the price of one but might be another way of looking at it but I was it could I take it from your from your smile that you 'll prepare to look at it things optimistic they 've made like you guys do you want to attempt a metal fill the regards about the instant sparks Royal interception as it is that 's an another water with regards to how they are now given you would like ideally to to incorporate that the sparks protein to send their earlier slide it into the new the new Ward rather than BC price we were to you yeah so that 's a change from the current situation and a change from the rather than are adjusting it would be yeah okay thank you how thick it fell no think Susie look at it 's going to hear from people like you about part of what is currently a wood so I just want to configure and you made it quite clearly that the people in this area and also on the other side pendants is right really look towards hoon hay and so what might take up my take on that is you really want to stay in the sprayed and water yeah okay and and I 'm really your where that why I 'm asking clarifying there is because previously we had a just earlier we had a submission with some other another group of residency look who know it could go into hallsville okay really you don 't get to it most people feel like they relate to barrington and they talked about the Barrington shopping center and the pioneer pool as areas that they congregate and you is and and they don 't necessarily go to the horse cool side as much there was a couple of people a and horse also we wouldn 't mind but the majority of people face towards the city in there currently and the and the sprayed and ward yeah Glenn and then Jimmy thank you Susie I picked up a cup of things in your submission one and the printed part you can talk about actually probably more than 16 boards would be better and then you talk about hoon a potentially losing its voice if it 's incorporated also that 's I think coming from the church background tour is that something you feel is quite important that communities retain their their voice I do um and I I think you guys are doing a marvelous job with what you 've got and and i am just outstanding yeah amazed at how you 've achieved what you have with such a small group of people it would be good to have more of you we 'd like to add like to see more of you some are out having coffee but is usually to me what I mean is I would like more representation but for there to be more space yeah Thank You area just one question so based on your understanding moment how many the people lovely live in a home head would like to stay in the spread and rather in the host well how many a moment out of the people that I spoke to yes we about 60 people at meetings yes and there were two people that said it didn 't really bother them or two people that said that rather stay with hallsville that 's the two gentlemen that play bowls there and the others all felt inclined towards the city sprayed inside yes yeah okay thank you that 's great look thank you very much much appreciated and thank you for what you 're doing you know it 's just great to see residents association being and I was sort of emerging from your involvement in the community so congratulations and thank you thank you oh um low _"

    "text": "them Julie took to bail was from the Summerfield residents association good morning and um thank you very much for the opportunity to speak to you all about summerfield residents association and how we see the representation footing them with our area I 've actually got copies as it possible to hinder these copies of a summary of our of our proposals in summary we have three proposals that we would like that you can he me and that would like to put forward and the first proposal as that Summerfield area is to represent both proposed of the proposed areas of a field in burien to south units and if need be to rename them if they need to be within units is possibly some field east so fueled West is per met one their short course on earth so this maintains the same identity recognition from our communities of interest such as our local schools are churches preschools and other local community groups in all our local residents so this we intend to sort of try to remain identifiable in easily locatable for the emergency services so that rather than rename it another area is Barrington south which our review is either Barrington Street or Barrington mole sort of thing so are we also wish to reduce the level of confusion for local residents businesses and the community groups by not introducing a new name by entered into tea for the area so so that 's basically the map one basically proposal to we wish for some of your boundary to be more clearly identified and easily separated by the frankly emotion Street boundary basically is permit to rather than it has proposed and the 16 Ward to do it down Rose Street which would then eliminate some of the area as you can see in the area that would make half of it and to spray them and half of it under Kashmir by doing the proposed new boundaries is permit to that would it would probably be more likely in the kashmir area and that would counter and balance the population numbers so that would actually increase the population numbers in kashmir and decrease their population numbers and freedom which to go with you know the even numbers that would actually support that it would also reduce confusion about where Summerfield area is as you can see on all these three maps in front of you and it 's consistent it identifies summerfield and one area as to whether it needs to be renamed in different areas to make it into units i can understand that and also if you keep it all in the kashmir area it will be easier for the likes of Summerfield residents association who imma cheer of to basically to represent easier rather than having to go to two different community boards or different represent own representatives basically so yeah I 'm overall is that we want to reduce confusion for our residents for our business and our schools it is also in keeping with google it is in keeping with neighborly also the school areas how the schools identify the areas as well and also is the bottom met that 's actually the city cycleways so at some 13 birthday as well and keeping with that so yeah so that some so it hopefully creates easier representation for our residents council staff as well it makes it more clear cup and the probe proposal through the main thing we would like for the new representation review as the community board staff members either remain unchanged or become increased to improve their local community representation general community board members are the ones that we normally would approach first so that that 's important to us and I think that 's hopefully that explains everything that we were like and any questions yeah i 've got i 'll just add off because so you would have heard me sort of comment on banksville on chiller a show so I so let 's pretend that we can resolve that and that the local government Commission agreed that would mean that some more population would go on to the Kashmir one at the other end so if we could move the whole block of Summerfield into sprayed on that would work too as long as you 're issuers is that the block remains together yes yeah please Andrew thank you very much indeed for the submission it 's always good to hear from local this is particularly useful in that regard you make all of your comments in the context of the 16 ward proposal which is the men we obviously went to a consultation for other submitters have made comments around the 40 model the 19 model of other models that we considered I 'm assuming in as much as you don 't comment on that and all of your comments are in the 16 model context that you 're happy with the model of 16 councillors I guess we have focused on what it 's important within our area and we acknowledge that you know the council and they need to be changes obviously with own crush it study and according to dividing up in making it fairly for management of crushes that he as a whole so Allah say so long as we get adequate community board representation and then it 's not such an a concern to us a kiss and yeah as long as we get good representation is the main thing how that 's done by the council really fit to your expertise um the main thing is and keep that community intact and at least confusion anyone else yep and help I am Julie you refer to a preference for a clear boundary so that Milton Street would actually extend along frankly street so were you what wanting that part with an supper frankly street to be in the cash me award or should it stay in the spate and I wasn 't quite period and as to what happens on the actual boundary of it like with a one side as you know sprayed on one side as Kashmir I guess that something that has to be negotiated but it 's trying to work out the boundaries of the whole area basically but you know it might need to be one cider sprayed on one 's beside as Kashmir yeah that would be need to be negotiated I think but it 's mainly the outside boundaries because the proposed representational review was proposing that it was done bro Street which all of Conway streets Denbury and even all those streets and between would possibly be I don 't know so what you 're seeking is at as to which ward those parts are in that again so I 'm what you 're seeking would like to SAS to do is to establish a clear a clear boundary between the awards he animal parts which are kind of like in between in as a major as to whether they 're in the kashmir ward or the future sprayed and ward but i also I 'm really hearing you say that it 's important that the community board be able to represent the Summerfield area that 's right so yeah I think there BTW i think near big greater representation of we know basically we don 't have to go to different counselors or different community board members for different strengths i thank you that would create more work as well in for the council and I can see implications i also see for future proofing you know it might be all one big community board at the moment and the spade and kashmir wilson might be of great big area them and the future maybe then it might be provisions to make spray them with halls well just future proofing it really fix to it yeah it was great thank you very much Paul much appreciated thank you very much for opportunity to talk to you thank you Susie set _"

    "text": "yeah shin-soo by and you 've got a personal submission to make as well so you want to divide them or do you want to combine them I just deal with one and then move on yeah oh yes yeah they don 't want to repeat myself so I always ask the question so thank you very much for the opportunity to speak today I 'm sorry I 've don 't ever come at my voice bugger and I 'm so by the Secretary of the lower kashmiri residents association endless is Louise and healer who are also on the committee I 'd like to start our submission by detailing the process of consultation which was undertaken by the committee to to put together a submission for this really important issue and we foreshadowed it about two months ahead with our newsletter by indicating to the local area that we were looking at this and we suggested you know that people are well think we 've included the link to the website so that people could look at that I 'm document consultation document and the actual consultation document was committee so that they 'd have a chance I think you had about four or five weeks didn 't you to have a look at it I actually found personally that the information available and the consultation booklet was actually very difficult to understand and I know that that relates to the fact that I 'm a newcomer to local body politics and you guys love it so there 's a lot of assumed knowledge within your area that I 'm not party to so I actually found their document very difficult to decipher for instance i found the tombs hillmorton south barrington north whatever to me they made absolutely no sense and that colored my our view of what we were reading and what you were trying to tell us and if they had been a reference point to the fact that they our statistics New Zealand blocks of niche blogs his mish blocks you know then even just a reference to that would have made much easier to make sense of what it was we were trying to read so our I developed because i found the process forward a pre discussion and piece of material that i sent round to the committee prior to have our particular meeting on it and because i wanted i knew that we 're all busy people and i wanted us to be able to approach this with an open informed mind and have some understanding of what it was we were being asked to comment on we also and sent round the copy of the barrington issues group submission and that was sent around worth crap with the permission of the group because and doing my reading background reading around this i found that there there was reference to the 14 wards submission and having done research in the past i know that i can 't comment on something unless I 've got a basis of comparison and vertically as we are struggling to understand the way things work so I summarized in my pre and preg committee and pre discussion material the contents of the discussion document and also the the the 14 ward now community board thanks to them and they 're really important to us offered support for member so at the meeting there was the committee plus two members of the public could read the newsletter and the 16 and 14 ward options were reviewed and explained from the material and questions were asked the community board member left and then us we as a committee discussed our thoughts and options and I asked for the committee people to send their thoughts to me within about three days so that I could work with those ideas so to me that the process had to be scrupulous and the process had to have integrity that what we were seeing was the information that was available out there for all of us to look at and that we formulated our own thoughts and opinions they send them to me and then it 's from those thoughts that I compiled the submission and I gather that you 've you will of all read our submission and I gather from the previous speaker that some of the issues that we have had been canvassed I did get the feeling from the document the condition document it felt like and it wasn committee that they 've been a lot of work put into this discussion document and I know that there was I know these sort of documents take a lot of work and the bringing together of lots of opinions and thoughts and it just sort of felt like oh yeah and i 'm not i 'm not being trivial but it was like is that fits we can make a route will go for that one we 've we can only put one out so we 'll go for this one and that 's not to diminish any of the work that was done but we felt from the minute we looked at it it was like hang on we don 't see this weekend we have focused on South Christchurch because that 's we went from and I can 't comment on ward boundaries out of here word or McCain 's or coastal area but looking at our particular area it just didn 't seem to us that it would work with having Kashmir spray tan and will stow all in together because as you 'll note an hour law the communities of interest fairness of representation and effective representation of communities under us as the main subheadings for our discussion so there 's talk and we knew that the boundaries can be modified I had been to a workshop that the community board ran and they said oh yes will you know the boundaries can be modified but at some point you say to yourself we 'll hang on a minute if there 's so many modifications needed why are we going with us and again for us looking at that 16 would model just it just didn 't register as something that was going to work and if you need a whole lot of boundary adjustments are you are you using the right model and again we keep coming back to the 14 counselor model which was a really good fit for our area and I admit I can 't concentrate you know under other areas also there 's a newbie to local body politics we have spent the year developing strong community monks with the area 's the groups in our area and you could say would model that wouldn 't change but in a way it does because we we are building in our communities of interest within a whole range of things not just residents associations but it has to do with emergency planning with neighborhood networks and support all of those things come into our grassroots level of thinking on our for our area and we certainly don 't want the assistance of the community boards diminished in any way because that 's everybody 's first port of call with no houses i had a have had some people contact me about things like bus routes and the fact they deliver only asset news leisure under the litter box but that 's where it starts you know and we can take things like the bus routes further so the community board for us forms are really important as you end it 's easy to say well you know it won 't be diminished but how do we know you know we want to be sure that we have our communities of interest able to be strengthened and our community boards safe which i it 's not clear to us why we need more counselors when the poll that was done earlier in the year I 'm not sure there 's a date on this and counts City Council 's but only the bigger is better and the city voted you know we can 't afford more counselors and then there was another one about the three options 14 Lord 16 ward status quo and as I indicated my submission that sort of question what are people going to do they 're going to look of it costs too much we don 't want that it 's a question it 's not a question that actually addresses what is the representation required for our future councils so I think some of that stuff was just a bit too glib and I 'm not saying you 're responsible for that but it 's what the people say when they 're out in the media when they 're looking through the local paper and it captures their eyes we need to make sure that people are informed about what 's going on or try to be hairdresser I said officers what we 're looking at and she she couldn 't even understand when I thought I had a very clear explanation what the representation review was about so it 's a difficult job that you have that we have and everybody is going to have their own opinion but I 'm really grateful that we can actually and present and person and say that and what our views are and when we talk about fairness of representation the the only numbers that I could find we 're the ones that work and in the public arena you refer to the local the local local I 've got it in here and I can 't fly will it work yes yeah and you refuse to that I did actually look at the end but I couldn 't find it so for people like me who think like me it would actually be handy to have had a reference yeah I could go back to it that the reference and the actors to the ten percent plus or minus it doesn 't refer to actual number oh it that 's the that 's the limitation and our struggle was around banks peninsula yeah I realized and that 's why I raised that issue with the previous submission is is that if we can if we can address the banks peninsula issue does that then give us a better mechanism for for resolving the other issues around the city so when you say ten percent plus or minus plus or minus what well you can 't have you can 't have really ten percent more residents in one area for voting well I think they see less yeah or fewer sorry I was like going to get my gramma right fewer rebalance and that in the area because the idea is that you know I mean it 's not going to be one vote count see cool but it 's not trying to get with a nice fat fearless if it 's about getting the fairness of numbers so that 's really what Venus is about okay what okay well in that case then from our perspective the difference between the 14 and the 16 Ward was actually much favor the 14 water proposal leave it fear that question this is got much time questions no one felt one question thank you so I just want to ask you some reference to that who hate her more some part of the current world yeah your suggestion is that that boundary that that area could go into sort of like I think you say the forcible area I just want to ask just where do you remember to submit a later today submissions from people in hoon hay yeah who liked it I liked me to say in fact they want to stay in this great hundreds i just wonder what your comment in relation to what they are likely to say very written to us will be um i think what it indicates is that they want to stay together yes and I suppose that 's where the boundary tweaks come and that you guys look at and again it relates to communities of interest and what 's happening in those communities and how their be served by the area that they end up him and I think that growth area they 've got the new service center and all of those facilities out there and it could be that they 're a bit of foot there then the perhaps more stable communities that are within the current area that we represent okay thank you I 'm just for my personal submersion I 'd like to say that this was a a group and I thought about it and I thought well I I did the writing for the room but I also felt that in order to and perhaps emphasize the personal feelings I wanted to add something so hints the individual submission and I sent it round the people that had attended the meeting of they to include that as part of it just to emphasize what their personal views were rather than the group view they were free to do so and I think a number of them Doug so it was really just about putting a personal stem on a perspective that I had adopted from what we had looked debt from what I had looked debt and certainly I feel pity that within my and crystallize it I felt that I had done the best that I could with what I had available so I I wanted to just add as an emphasis that this is where I personally felt was important before asking I 'm so it 's all I wanted to do you sort of said at one point that you know that that weather experts and and there you 're not and therefore it wasn 't as accessible you know a document as as it might have otherwise and Ben and I just want to say that you 've done an extraordinary job given that was the opening statement and I mean we will learn from there because I think I think you 're brighter we refuted the legislation we should refuse the clause and we can pick up on on things like that so we can improve our practice from the from the comments that you made not everyone around the table is an expert at the see that I had nothing to do with local government until do you know yes I think a number of us have have on and i have to say that one of the early submissions that we received on this is why are we doing this now when we 've been through an earthquake where you know why don 't we just leave the wards the way they are for another term and and and then do this again and there 's a side of me that absolutely agrees with that position but you have to do it now because every six years you require to do it but I was stood think do I go to the minister and say please could we have an exemption you know could have done that with the long-term plan actually we 're better off by having a long-term plan in place and we can tell the people crushes that we we have a plan and that we have the capacity to pay our way and so so that 's a good outcome and yeah we 've got the capacity to do this as well I think that what the submission process is done as its enable people like yourself people from other areas I mean on both sides of the hill about thanks Peninsula and I actually think that strengthen our position to actually go to back to their local government Commandments that 's exactly right Ian and thank you that I approached it I have a long history of being an educator and my most recent position was a nurse educator at Christchurch hospital and if I had seen her on my cytotoxic self-learning pecker you know you 'd have gone um what and so I approached us the same way and let you know for me the cytotoxic self-learning Patrick as self-explanatory and we 're because I loved it whereas and that 's what i mean by my comment about you with with this document is that you loved thus that was much more familiar to you and that was a little bit i had we 're can a bit of digging up and we can you know we can reach a point where and we can express ourselves in a way that hopefully understood ya know it 's really appreciated so thank you very much thank you very much and thank you _"

    "text": "on behalf of Kashmir Residents Association more to go with us yeah boy isn 't this included an hour pick it is it change just now we just have nice eyes and Iran does change yeah ok this is what right far away good morning made a mere and counseled us thank you very much for this opportunity to meet with you today my name is rep tundle I 'm here representing the Kashmir residents association and our organization is with residents in the wider area in south of Christ huge around the barrenland commercial complex is the Barents initiative group and I want to introduce Jim Kang resident of spreyton sitting beside me today he 's helped write the submission that you have and acknowledging our swells from some field who will SPECT you that this afternoon also helped draft the submission so first off I want to convene the council very strongly that the work that 's been done pre consultation and drafting drafts different different options coming towards the proposal that you put out showed a high degree of intelligence of understanding of local communities where they really the major issue that i have and coming here today my perspective is really from that of community organizing of community associations residents associations it 's really really hard has been since the earthquakes strong commitment Leah I must also acknowledge I 'm a member of the spendy community board for resonant groups the one on part of his a long history in is quite and terrible privilege should we say it 's been there for over a hundred years but I think our benefit area residents association to belong to something that should be a right for all citizens of Christ huge and this is the opportunity with the asst but of planning that the council is putting together to facilitate community engagement we know that you have a community governance policy which at this point could very much be advantaged by the decisions you make with your presentation of you or disadvantaged so this is about how can communities organized to engage with the council directly and the one thing they they don 't need that they 're seeing the 16 would proposal is too many boundaries area as has been listed in the submission that you have we 're talking about someone filled in Spain boundary hillmorton it in towards Hall School in spreyton hoon hay into wards halls water and spray tans and wilston in two different community board areas and due to rewards so it is quite a mess actually from the community organizing point of view to try and fix up all those problems at the one time and so when you draw it back or to see what causes this number of divisions and local communities it is that the numbers too high the number of the division is too high so it 's like a strainer that the smaller the fine of the mesh of the strainer the smaller the particles that come through and so with 16 wards you 've got smaller containers for Communities then would be the case with less wards so the argument here today is you 're close to getting it right and clearly if the communities work together and feel what it 's right to express it to you clearly and the council agrees with agree with you and we 'll all be heading towards what 's going to be an exceptional year of engagement for the count the local communities next year so it 's really important to get us right now to get that the met in which the engagement next year will happen to suit the communities and solution here is really that it doesn 't seem to being the case that communities have been connected with adequately that the number of 16 Ward 's as a requisite or high number of awards 60 or higher causing the smaller Ward size is causing too many diversion so it 's a straightforward proposal here to say that just reduce that number a little bit 14 and it 's much better picture for Christchurch all the community issues community boundary issues that I 've listed hillmorton hoon hae-sung few divisions go away and by reducing the community board area from three awards to to the woolston issue is resolved as well in primary around there as retention of the heavy ferry meet community board because what has heard most often and the communities me boards are highly valued and you 've seen that in the feedback that you had already that people like their community boards being around and like it or not there is a backward step been taken with whether the proposal any inversion of the proposal reduces the number of community board members and every ward and that 's really a big big loss for the council and community engagement so how can we moderate the impact of that by not taking away ugly ferrymen board and retain boarding wards in total I better finish soon so you 've got plenty of time for Christians so I take it you can you read the submission and seen the maps that are in there so it picks up your July draft of affording Lord met and asks for some boundary revisions to that in suggesting that the fcat Valley needs to be identified as a geographic feature connected with the peninsula after which that large wood should be and that the bexleyheath get wood is the right name for the large would end that the whole of the history of Ali needs they 're the legacy of the County Council has retained in the river connection has made the valley through two little term as one whole that 's what we see is an appropriate way to integrate exponential into the city and we would see population exchanged at the worst end of the ward of the beckenham water the footing would model so the craycroft area could stay with them and the Western orange music also as we understand it parents that have similar interests and being part of that Hill sub-award at that point so I 'll leave it in time questions I just wondered whether musta came whether you 'd like to make a contribution as well we 'd like to hear from you as well oh thank you very much opportunity but I 'm only here to represent Rick but my view is that after having set through yesterday or some of yesterday I come to the conclusion that we are only representing the south of Christchurch really and we 're not representing the whole of Christ you so therefore what we 've got to say is really also like to say that I believe that paint furniture is too big a narrative to accumulate into or to assimilate into into Christchurch maybe I mean that maybe that 's a good place to start because I think that you know there 's been a lot of discussion around around the banks peninsula and certainly the desire of the council has been to sort of meet what we felt was the direction from the local government Commission the last time it considered our boundaries and and that was to really assimilate banks peninsula run to the city and I think some of the problems that had been raised by the South Christchurch community if I can group them in that way actually stemmed from that decision so if we were able to review that decision and if that we 're acceptable to the local government Commission is it just a question of adjusting some of the boundaries that we 've talked about here rather than because as you say you 're speaking to South Christchurch but your your your your viewers is to reduce the number of boards from position adopted by the council would with some adjustments around the boundaries I mean we head up submission yesterday which suggested that the wolf 's Turner shoe could be addressed by shifting a boundary and bringing some of wolfs turn unto the unto the max do you think we could just you know if if banks peninsula is the driver and if we were able to resolve that would we be able to resolve some of your issues just by shifting some of the boundaries and making it more inclusive of the communities of interest that you 've identified are you talking to me or to me well I thought that can you raise the issue of things lunch hour so i thought well i think if we could get rid of thanks for each other we can 't get rid of it if we could establish it as its own ward as that as at the moment yeah well as i see if we could then certainly by shifting some of the boundaries to what they were before we were we 've been closer to what we for you have the option of saluda not exponential or ignoring the fact that it 's the driver of the whole reliving a Christchurch we have done grated somehow and I 've heard clearly and from the council represents the area now that one counselor Ward as durable as comfortable and so every war is going to have one council that 's the major issue you 've got do you have two wards poor counselor to council peer award in a smaller number of ward say seven all right and we 're going to have a bigger number in one counselor ward so not taking up that issue accepting that it 's one with ward councillor because that 's what Beck 's furniture has got all of Christchurch is going to look like Beck 's furniture from there on we just have to move forward with that so yes it 's a matter of adjusting where you put those boundaries of exponential oh and we do have a strong community of interest where we are and can see that Valley being divided up as this this beneficial result them in it together that Ward area in trying to do something to bring that community together in a circus entation ability it 's good there any other questions thank you very much both of you I really appreciate your coming along today thank you thank you thank you oh right _"

    "text": "Community Association to join us thank you I don 't know if you followed yesterday 's submissions but there 's been a lot of discussion about that whether we can still pursue the idea of a single council ward for four banks peninsula so I just know if you understand yet yeah good right I 'm loudly and clearly oh hello everyone um it 's great to be here actually and we were just saying when we were setting up the order what a nice feel it 's all got you know sounds like come you 're all quite pleased to be here which is great that 's a killer and so thank you for the opportunity to present this response on behalf of the hip cat Valley Community Association I 'm the current chair of the Association and duty as the current Secretary the information we submitted in writing was the outcome of a discussion held at our October meeting and this presentation further develops the main theme or concern raised which relates to the matter of representation however before we talk about anything else we 'd like to and march 2015 both of us attended the workshops which we thought enabled a high level of discussion and engagement throughout all communities our assumption is that the information gather that these events reflecting a desire for small awards and more counselors plus ideas about how participants defined their communities help to inform the contents of the council 's representation review proposal so we 'll be presenting around three main themes communities of interest the need for effective representation and the need for fear representation so communities of interest are described in the guidelines as areas of distinct identity based on to topography economic or social activities socio-economic or ethnic characteristics distinct local history and dependence on shared facilities as mentioned in our written submission overall our community is divided about the issue of whether the inclusion of heathcott into their banks peninsula some norwood offers an appropriate reflection of shared characteristics it is fair to say that the majority of our residents believe that our community is more in common with urban neighboring suburbs rather than with what is perceived to be the more rural communities that compromise the the communities which would make up the proposed subdivided Ward IE littleton diamondharbour governors bay port to levy quail island heathcott valley monks bay march pleasant and sumner are defined by the geographic landscape which has made for strong community spirit similar values and shared sense of identity in each place it 's interesting to think about whether the matter that I 'm going to talk about in a minute relating to effective representation actually affected the way people saw themselves in terms of the community of interest you know because it 's thinking about effective representation which covers matters to do with accessibility and size of the area avoiding arrangements that may create barriers to participation not splitting communities of recognized interest and not grouping together communities that share few commonalities there 's complete agreement in our community that of Heth cap failures to be incorporated into the proposed banks peninsula sun reward the proposed level of representation simply will not work given that a look at banks peninsula and christchurch on Google Earth shows that banks peninsula is at least five times the size of Christchurch it seems case for treating it as an exceptional case we believe that one counselor should not be expected to represent a population that is so widely spread and diverse and that to try to do so will absolutely create barriers to participation for our community and for the other communities as well in addition we think that the Ayodhya while you are and the Littleton sumner community boards need to elect six members each for the same reasons that we 've outlined above so thinking about fair representation we understand that the local government Commission has required the council to explore the need for all areas to be more or less the same size and with a population within plus or minus ten percent of each other however we also understand that the requirements in the act and guidelines give particular emphasis to the role of communities of interest noting that it is an essential part of the rippers tation process and needs to be carried out before determining what fear or effective representation this representation review proposal makes a judgment about communities of interest and has incorporated Heathcott valley into or fair representation in fact whether the banks peninsula some some of the world remains as proposed or reverts to the status quo the situation remains that the geographical spread and isolation of some communities plus the mix of diverse communities make it a distinct identity we believe that a representation review should mean that the level of representation communities enjoyed prior to the review is not compromised in the case of the banks peninsula some reward we urge the council to argue for an exceptional case scenario if we would be included in this ward we should have the same level of representation if not more than all the other urban Ward 's we were actually interested to note that at some meeting previously councillors resolved unanimously on the motion of the mayor that the council 's preferences that the banks peninsula community be combined with other communities to form award that complies with the definition of fair representation of the local electoral act 2001 preserving the option of the occur or wide error community to be treated as an isolated community so it seems to us that you ward as his specific and exceptional needs in any case so we strongly urge you to reconsider the representation arrangements to include two counselors and six community board members which would come to go some way to compensate for the diversity of rural and urban communities as well as a land area that 's much more difficult to service being far larger than all the other words combined alternately alternatively even the council should put the case to the local government Commission for banks peninsula to be kept as a separate ward and effect was to be the case we believe that heathcote could easily be included enter the Lynwood burwood coastal ward thank you questions Andrew thank you very much for your submission of becoming you to present it today um I 'm particularly interested in the relationship between the banks peninsula and other neighboring areas that may share a community of interest with little terminal or max Peninsula and I 've got a couple of questions the first of which relates to exactly there we heard a submission yesterday that some suggested that littleton Heath do represent a to the newly built pub in Heath cook when we heard about the heath cook people going to the dairy in little turnin if pubs and dairies define a community land great is that the view of the people in littleton does share a community of interest with the people in here capelli I think that it 's difficult I always feel uncomfortable speaking on behalf of the whole community when I haven 't really when we haven 't really talked about that i would say instinctively yes up to a point but we also feel we have strong connections with some red cliffs and even you know theory Mead and parts of lynnwood as well personally I feel that that that we have a strong level of commonality with the Littleton community but I mean I guess you know you people are guess we 'll have to think carefully about what you do next and you 'll be thinking about which communities you know could fit together to make this whole thorny issue of effective representation work you know I know so if we will turn ugly if we might help tease out what i 'm looking for the it always take the middle ground of not going with what 's proposed in the mobile that 's in front of us but not going with banks peninsula as an isolated community status quo and we were to look at saying maybe Sumner and heathcote or some North Coast have a particular community of interest with little term the other areas like Mount Pleasant for example and we heard a submission from Mount Pleasant yesterday and those other suburbs in the middle don 't have would you feel that you had a stronger connection with waterfront suburbs on the city side of the hills or a stronger connection with little Sun on the peninsula again that 's a really different we we have commonalities with all of those communities and I and I would think that probe heathkit valleywood residents would be split on how they would view that and the same way as Jackie and I probably are so when we certain we certainly do have we do have strong links with fairy meet in particular and they 're meet rather than at littleton so in those in there in that way we certainly do have more of an interest on the on the city side rather than the bay side and the final question sorry also we are connected by the tunnel yeah works which Sumner is not yes so you know there 's those kinds of I mean you know hmm and the final question there 's a certain sense in your submission that if we set the community of interest issue aside and we look at now the representation issue the vie him with the peninsula that inevitably means a lower level of representation in the new head and I 'm getting sense that it it 's almost that by joining the peninsula you 're inheriting the same sort of concerns that we heard from a co robisz yesterday that 's right we 're really concerned about that we 're really concerned that our level of representation will drop and and you know there 's there 's so many issues in our Valley as there are in so many other communities but we have been incredibly floods and all of those other issues that have happened for us and we have really really appreciated the fact that we have had our counselors available to us in our community board if we were only represented by one person and for community board members we 've got some problems we 're not just for us for the whole of the the community I mean I don 't you know returning about 16 Ward 's here and one of the things that came up at the community meetings that we were part of was that people were wanting small awards and more counselors because you know that we felt that then the repartee I mean there was another proposal for 19 wards I mean you know is that is that another is that another issue that could be looked at again and the light of all these submissions I don 't know Phil thank you because I think you 're coming for number we kind of the nub of the issue and just to sort of film this on you outline three clear areas that you 're concerned about be fair so of all those variables and it 's hard to say which will be the protein but just from your comments now are you leaning towards that a major factor for people in etiquette Valley would be having effective representation absolutely thank you clean thank you you used what I thought was a strong term divided over communities of interest in relation to including Heathcott into the ward I just would like to know any how strong that is to try and kind of measure that that feeling so if we talk about say you know is it to the point that you 'd feel the ends of local government would be served over say community well-being well such a division is that that 's wrong I I don 't know anyone would want to die in a ditch over that no it 's just that we you know it 's a way of describing the fact that we we have different thoughts about okay night sciences yeah a bit of thought yeah and it 's all about representation I mean yes sir that 's the crisis is terms of you know the communities of interest and if I 'd look at pisgah the local volunteer library has a relationship with fallston and red cliffs um if you look at the issue that we had as a community water in the bridle path right to and go towards someone yes which hurrah was yeah so in terms of that rolling in those community facilities that seems to me that you focus more towards the coast in water Ward 's the city rather than out too little time are they have any other facilities we you actually see them something part of the community restaurants cafes I think abuzz until he could I 'd be going through the tunnel quite frequently rather than deter us peerumede but i think this um I think this fits that issue it 's what is convenient for the moment and yannis just raised a really good point which is that there are there are issues that are going to be much more relevant to hit on the city side of the history of the tunnel yeah yeah yeah thank you very much for I hope that my comments at the outset indicate that we are very open to you know reviewing what we put in front of the local government Commission aware of the fact that we have to mount a case because yes the local government Commission ultimately will make the decision but thank you very much thank you much appreciated thanks for having you thank you um _"

    "text": "so we 'll move on to now boy we haven 't Peter 's not able to be here so here we got we 've got someone from the beckenham Neighborhood Association sorry I haven 't got your name holidays hello my name is Richie Wilson hi welcome Peter apologizes for not being here his wife was seriously and unexpectedly ill and is in the hospital oh do pass on our guts we all know Peter very very well so it would be great if you could pass on our peace and all respects and and wish you well well thank you very much for that thanks I 'm Peter was going to make an individual contribution after this so that won 't be happening and i understand i 'm on the program to make a contribution to so that might be happening so I 'm afraid of your timetable to spend that destroyed that it 's fine from the submissions that I 've been hearing when I 've been sitting here it seems like our proposals would destroy everything that gone before because the common thread of the submissions that going to make was that the the number of councillors should be increased and increased preferably to the old number of 24 and the reason for this is the larger number of councillors have a better oversight over the staff of the City Council and so better decision-making would hopefully occur the sort of thing that 's concerned the BNA is the perceived underinsurance of city assets before the earthquake I 'm not sure if that 's actually true would people agree that the council 's assets are underinsured and that the insurance payouts have been inadequate to rebuild the facilities some somewhere under insured we haven 't settled our sure hmm well if that 's the sort of issue that we would be concerned that more counselors were done would have greater oversight over the staff and better decisions were made I don 't think that the council had any oversight of the decision to change the insurer or the amount of insurance that was taken out so but you know I mean that 's this is what I 'm not aware of that so this is the the 's interesting to see that the central government increased the number of Representatives because they felt that a smaller Parliament could be captured by a really small number of people and and policies which were generally supported could be pushed through in the face of numerical opposition by by a small group and so a large number of councillors I think is that as a good idea if we compared the number of councillors in Christchurch which the population of 350 6,000 I suppose you heard these arguments rehearse before where we can have 13 counselors to other cities in New Zealand which have much smaller population basis but a similar number of councillors like Invercargill which is a seventh or size of Christ Church has 12 councillors and Nelson wasn 't faith the size of Christ Church has 12 councillors Wellington half the size of Christchurch he has 14 councillors if you combine Wellington and lower hutt together which has a population still smaller in Christchurch they would have a total of 26 councillors so I feel that you could argue that the number of councillors at present is I would urge you to rethink the whole numerical basis of the if the ribs into it representatives in Christchurch and have more than 16 counselors and my submission I suggested that 18 councillors and nine community boards with be a symmetrical arrangement the sort of thing that I would hope to see now I realize that it would mean rejigging the whole process but I feel that this is something that could be worthwhile I also said a mic submission that the people in beckenham will be happy to be in a world called Kashmir even if it does contain people from woolston but we would be happy to be in Kashmir the beckenham neighborhood associations area is not entirely within the kashmir ward tennyson street is not the boundary at the bacon nope association and so i could suggest that if you were making small changes that the boundary of Kashmir could be pushed slightly north of tennyson street to what is the boundary of your residency so that 's an excellent question it 's a it 's a series of streets a block or so north of Tennyson straightens right so we 've done it again we 've taken the straight line approach rather than natural community of interest boundary well I 'm not sure that it is in a community of interest but it 's the historical boundary of the beacon Neighbors Association it 's also far from obvious the Lions I suspect that when it was drawn there must have been a pseudonym Residents Association and and it was done as that compromise between that and bacon right so that you 've had two resonance Association combined I believe in the past it was not combined but I don 't believe there is a system is easy for businesses right so it said it was a bit of a debate about when but you know the lines really well so have we got the lines right do you think and here or do we want staff to do a bit more work on the boundary for me I mean I think you 're basically if the residents association feel that the line is in there are those that want to be part of it there Signum has always been on the pseudonym side of tennyson street and vision has always been on the victims side that is directly as what it is but you know I mean let 's face it you know is that South findell to nose at north Kashmir I 'm an attorney if you 're selling barber fed matters that people want to be part of victims residents association that in that dead eerie the net is fine I mean and you 've got a defined area and it is absolutely fine but historically FinCEN street was the break between set them in be so just for me it 's things and which are bits of you agree that there seems to me that I overall the old setting them if you like would be the area now which is Markakis booster right now I don 't know if you 're not sure but that 's my take on a mistake people it isn 't so we end what while the list of this discussion about we will central fat it clearly isn 't part as a paddler fishing right are you for submission up it is an interesting observation how can you raised the question of us around the insurance that the interesting thing from my point of view was when the counselor juice from 24 to 12 but also got away from its committees so I had no finance committee and you could argue that lack of government oversight so um I was interested in the idea that you know we should we should try and get more representation given the new zealand context where we do seem to be underrepresented so then you in your view your personal years as a teen and the community boards being nine I was just trying to understand whether that included the peninsula or whether that the product should be treated kind of separate yes and it 's a pity Peter isn 't here because his views on the potential are very clear and that is that the incorporation of the potential in Christ gypsy was a mistake he told me that he regards it as being a mistake that can 't_''_527.68 be rectified that I mistake nevertheless so I did see the whole of their area wasn 't sufficient but I don 't know what the alternative would would be I 've also said that I thought little tuna salmon were a good good foot together I have a bit to do with those areas and that 's it they seem to me to be similar and some of people and that have similar concerns i would say hecker are I things are different different the case in time and cut it loose I say Pauline thank you it 's just your preference for more councils in the recommendation of 16 you 've even suggested up to 24 yes but that would add a quarter conceivable cost to ratepayers yes so what 's your views that you view that is acceptable in Russa perhaps yes I certainly do and the the costs of extra counselors I would say would be well affordable in comparison to things not being done as well as they could be done and we did have a discussion about the relative costs of community boards and counselors and so on and I 'm not fully aware of would be a possibility okay thank you in the other Christian no that 's good thank you very much and again please pass on our you know regards to Mater owners wife and have these washers thank you _"

    "text": "up to Mary Williams from the top annoy heritage group my old stomping ground appear to brief statement I 'd like to read you I think it gives some context and background to the submission I 've made strong communities give people a sense of belonging and encourage them to take part and social cultural and political life now those words aren 't mine they are in fact in the 2007 council strategy and I know a lots changed since then but i think they are still hartford council guidelines we feel that the recommendations coming out of the representation review do not satisfy this criteria indicates intention changes to papanui we could spend a lot of time debating what the geographical limits of this community are what a certain is that some of the areas scheduled to be allocated to hear word indisputably part of the historical papua narrative i referred to these in my written submission but the best examples arson james parks and paul 's church and even more so to the cemetery attached to the church the letter was originally a public graveyard not tied to is testament to the community involvement Peponi we re say some paul 's church and the pepper new heritage group have all been it will work together to tidy what was rather an unkempt precinct even before the earthquakes and record record details of all information displayed on tombstones that provide valuable information from the social narrative of pepper new you the extent to which the loss of these areas were weak in the local community is of course unknowable but it will certainly not strengthen it having parts of what we consider to be quintessential papanui in a different world under a different community board will destroy the continuity that has been built up under the efficient and sympathetic pepino is surely community board that currently exists we believe that the planners have been seduced by the straight line that is pepper no erode it seems an easy and mixed solution to those redrawing boundaries to equalize the size of the franchise 's Awards there 's always an alternative in our retina submission we have made a suggestion to save at least some of the streets in infrastructure threatened a consequential change somewhere else for a cursory examination that projected new boundaries suggest that there is possible room to move by reassigning the residential area between San Orban street and Ennis road to the central water which under the recommendations still shows a population imbalance and it seems to me that okay you give some back to pep annuity and you can grab some back from central that might equalize things more adequately than they have been done in recommendations papanui is an area with a post settlement history of 165 years our plead you is to consider ways in which in our community may be preserved and strengthened if you adopt the recommendations they would result in a step along the path to its disintegration condo wave yes if you put a line down con delay then you split the community there that 's that 's my issue with it I know the area really well I grew up yes yeah swing on it for fortitude yes it is the edge of a mish blockers enough is that the light is it the orange Lyman 's down the 's just a manager but it 's the area unit we 're going on here so these it is a bit weird I mean it runs down blouse road currently but people seem to be quite used to that anyway yes they do I mean if I go but we 'd right back to not to ancient history the borders of pepper nuit were Norman 's road and maize road an idiot and that was caused when these promise of organs became a thorough that 's where some orden stopped and by definition permanently started fine things accepted something hmm so you haven 't seen it as a big issue for the community of aldi remained busy yes yeah no I mean the thing is is that I totally agree and I went to one of the Pavano a historic society events and and just have seen all of this history and you 're quite right it 's an association with cover no not with a new ward so it makes absolute sense to include it within the coven own ward and there have been other submissions to take that central so and the numbers look like they would add up so you know that so do we just get some advice perhaps on leaving it as the current boundary or is there a case to be made for it to go right up to wire up my rocky road that was efficient i was just in terms of long graders and then up to working and then back up bly 's yeah that would be closed for the old boundaries of innovation because because you can see from Martians population actually if you take some from pepper nuit Martians are set behind so you could actually take quite a bit out of Martians that back in the pepper nuit yes and you 'd end up with the population ratio is kind of working getting here too low though so we 'll do some novel do I 'll do changes and in some numbers part of it it 's quite significant because there 's quite a bit of population in here woods already know but we 'll do some girls rejigging these numbers vicious little options yeah so I mean challenge in terms of moving things around but I think I think the case is well made that those are definitely parts of papanui so I mean I remember as a child going to some James Park I agree that I mean I always used to say that I grew up in pub annoy i think the real estate industry changed the name of the area where i grew up too strong God knows why can 't win miles away from Stone Road and the real sudden she 's got a lot of that 's right but I agreed with the comment that Jamie made yesterday about you know it 's an Auburn sueno buying mirabel when you sell yeah so it 's a very similar thing Pauling did you have a question no all right well I think that you 're hearing that there 's a lot of desire to get the bounding right for that part of the ward but the area that you 've identified really should be in the pub no award very much thank you very much _"

    "text": "Victoria Neighborhood Association as well okay hi thank you I wasn 't planning to go through the submission it is as presented in writing what what I was asked to do by the group is just to give a little bit of background to it which wasn 't didn 't work on the forum so excuse me they wanted me to just tell you what we did leading up to the submission that we put in several representatives of our association attended the first workshops way back when the consultation was first beginning several more attended the recent ones that were after the consultation where some of the results were presented we had two council staff members come to one of the Victoria neighborhood committee meetings probably about a week to ten days before the submission deadline to just go back over the process look at some of the implications answer some of the questions and we then set up a group that did the draft submission we did manage in the end to consult with all of our members it 's 106 financial members at the moment plus some members very still involved so I suppose it was probably about 100 day or 130 people none of them disagreed with the the draft which is more or less what 's here we just tidied up a few things and put in the the first choice which was to keep central on its own to have its own board but we sort of knew that at this point in time you would probably find that premature but it was looking ahead to the future if and when the central city does become as large and diverse as people are planning several of the people that that then got back to us said that they were putting in a submission in their own right as individuals as well a few had already done it and then Saul ours and some people had already done their draft and made a few changes but basically had put in their own with alternative ideas and six of those people so I 've actually written out there and typed up their names in case you need it so we can have that but they wanted one as well even though as residents in the area they put end something that was slightly different the associations approach was to make as few changes as possible because having been involved in that consultation from the beginning we knew how much time and energy had already been put into what it was that you came up with and so even though some of the ideas for the configurations of community boards were different from what we put into the final submission as you know one change here makes ten changes there and some of them we said oh my goodness we 've changed every single configuration and those people must have given you or given their boards or whoever they consulted with ideas of who they wanted to be paired with so we really didn 't want to redraw the whole map for you and I was also asked to acknowledge our current two counselors and the Hagley ferry made board because we we think as in this map we are very much the central central area because we 've sort of right smack in the middle of we 've been very well served by our two fellows here and by the board I guess the only thing having listened to the other the previous speakers is that our focus was on the configuration of the boards the for the location where we are which if you don 't know the Victoria Neighborhood Association I 'd probably put it in here but it 's bounded by victoria street b li avenue souls very straight in colombo street we have very close relations with all of the inner city the current inner city residential areas in fact there is a inner city residential area group and we we do meet or communicate quite often but we didn 't really I don 't even think we discussed the actual boundaries of the Central Ward because we knew from everything we had gone to that you had to put them together so that they had equivalent population so we assumed that this was how that worked out the best and because of our location the boundaries of the other people have talked about wouldn 't be an issue to us personally and central as award as a specified ward we we did agree with it really was the combination of wards and two boards that we talked about ad nauseam unless you want me to go over and remind people what 's on here I 'm happy to clarify your answer questions if there are any well it 's let 's go to questions and see how we go okay but I think that I mean your submission is pretty clear around the community board issue so Pauline Phil and jame um Thank You Marjorie and if I mr. i know that you if you 're not comfortable with the groupings of the community boards that would come into your wood so which ones would you be comfortable and the no that 's right they were there were three alternatives the first one is the one that i just mentioned that was put in because of the consultation that we undertook was but and because of the unique issues facing central and other reasons that I put down here is to have a one ward board and to have that be choice and again trying to make the fewest changes or implications for other groupings was central with Walston in lynnwood and the third alternative and they really are almost equal as far as we 're concerned but we wanted to put them forward because of those other implication would be central with Walston only so what I said at the bottom of this of my version is Walston is our preferred partner but we but were happy to have Linwood with us what we do not think makes any sense whatsoever is the central papanui marshlands configuration we just we can 't get our heads around that and we didn 't hear any of that being put forward by any of the other groups that were in the consultation workshops that we were answered you also see Billy Ayers as being a boundary well it 's our actual boundaries so for us it is but no by boundary i made a demarcated something that separates you from the silligans side yes yeah like logical Billy Avenue and sort of almost every way you can think of is a natural ending 's the end of what people think of as the central city it 's our boundary I mean to us it 's the boundary we have end of the northern at you we have we have very little to do what we have nothing to do with simply because there 's been no there 's been no issue that has brought us together except for residents and in some cases businesses that are on the fringe of a Bailey Avenue victoria street and around in that area but yes to us it 's a natural boundary but we weren 't so worried about where the boundary of the ward itself is because but there must be why you you 're not comfortable with working with the papanui community board or the Martian because you don 't feel it oh yes we can 't think of anything that 's in common which thank you there would be with sun ovens and pub annoyed so I mean at some point there is a link I totally get martian that I think Martin 's as I think you 're right about there about you 're in the central city there 's a link with everything in a way because you know even the way it looks here I mean everything points to the central city yeah and we did hear that and the consultation is that everybody wants a piece of the action of the central city and they all have an opinion about the central city and of course they do and of course they should as as do every counselor have an interest and implications for the central city there 's a difference when what you 're looking at excuse me are those issues from a residential and a residence standpoint and who you have like things with and we just think the older and redeveloped being redeveloped areas of walleston and Linwood and even when we see the kinds of things that they raise when we look at issues and listening to other people is just much more in common than st. Albans or continuity or and so I think it comes back to what Ellie pointed out before but how much do you think this is your historical ties be really stretch to think what the challenging world how the changing world would Ben would bring motions in central it Mullins has so many issues of its own ashes like Marshalls I think we all agree so what about our days early reach you know and it 's it 's connection is with paranoid well so Eddie must have thought so they 're so I yeah yeah yeah no but uh ok Marsh ones were taking out of the let 's take it out of the picture and let 's talk about popping I instantly lynnwood am all stunned because i think that i think they are the real issues and and maybe we could get some advice from staff about whether it is possible to have a smaller community board that just focuses on the center of it one thing that I 'm I 'm very mindful on is that if we achieved our ambition which is to have you know 20,000 people going inside the forever news then you would be the size of a ward and your own right yeah and I wonder whether we are are we eating boundaries not pushing about it that creating boundaries because we 're working on a you know sort of a quality of myths but does the same rules apply to the establishment of a community board and I guess that 's the advice that we could so for so the bank was solid ice but you couldn 't just have a community board for soup for the central city ward both single community road in it Walt so there could be an additional community from you and it would be and that might solve a problem but I also might establish the framework for the future you know so yeah so welcome well this is where sometimes associations can become wimps because that was by far the preferred I 've showed one and in fact because lots of our consultation given all sorts of reasons is by email and electronic meetings even and that one got more people that 's how we got the hundred meters and giving all sorts of reasons but we ended up saying we the royal we ended up saying they 'll never go I do want to say there was a there was also enthusiasm for the woolston when we were thinking if we were combined with I think it 's just our area anyway seeds are ya sees those as more enabled we still I know we have multi-million dollar townhouses and everything else going up in our neighborhood but we still see ourselves as also having the kinds of issues that are in the older neighborhood and and with more social housing and so on but if you have any inkling toward aboard I also think that would resolve the problem that several people raised even though we were supporting the 16 the increase in the number of councillors and realized that would mean one per ward we really felt sorry for the person who was elected to central because there would just be so many things that that person would be involved in and so many people outside of the ward also wanting a piece of that person so for all those reasons could we just pretend that we 've said here that it 's a really strong first choice 's good si have a question that fell edges you 've not you doing Jimmy shaft in your preferences then and it 's been really helpful and it 's helpful it ties in with the previous submitters to it does help very much yes I 'm sorry is it if we can 't do that yeah there 's a call back position would you also support say increasing the number of elected representatives on the community boards would that be yeah I hadn 't_''_944.67 we we just hadn 't thought of that what we talked about more which I put in here and is also going to emphasize which relates in a way is all of the talking that you 've done I don 't think it was in in here but we know that you 're planning to or thinking about greater devolvi more responsibility to the boards which we certainly agree with so if you put those two things together you probably would need a stronger or a bigger board but there 's still are things that only counselors can do Andrew the delegation and well and just 'm just not sure and it would just be a personal opinion because we didn 't think of that and didn 't talk about disabled the suggestion wouldn 't pay to reduce the number of councillors no no but I 'm just not sure if on its own making the board vigor if if we if we were still either with partners that we didn 't think we had much in common with if you were doing that and had a separate community a separate board for the central city it obviously wouldn 't need to be the biggest by any means with it when did I think I 'm dithering I don 't see this an oven side of it you know that that 's included and central boundary and as you say that that 's neither here nor there to you that the boundary it wasn 't_''_1041.65 in any of the gate was a work they were looking and you know that the the message that came through from that area and was that they associated themselves with loving as part of the central song so that they 't see themselves as connected to pop annoy as strongly as they saw themselves connected to the central AC and given it that 's my ambition to live with them walking distance of hagley park I cannot we 've got some really good town houses being built right next to us taking away all of our son but we 'd love to have you there okay hope you could do a deal with the developer because they 're all jerks actually we thought it was going to it 's actually working out fine so great take away that Jimmy no I 'm meeting you okay thank you yay just one question because your foster choice you know if create the specific order bow to me the central cities that the words the needs I 'm concerned one counselor am i right mention one cancer but how many poor members to how many chameleon there is central world case on you it was based on even based on the demographic culture the population maybe two so 33 elected member organized the meeting you think nursing it doesn 't make you I for a city reward on its own right week we could say six or five or whatever I think the work mode and how many we 'd have tinley or we would we would have to talk about more we dope yeah we re concern was one yes it counts consulate for sensuous that area that includes the central city as well as the other that our concern was for that person but if there was a dedicated board I think it would even help that person I 'll tell you what one of the ideas was that you 're probably really like one person wanted to double the number of councillors enhance your pay so that it cannot equal that 's what used to okay thank you so much correct thank you very much Marjorie there was some very and light manga de um do you need to know which I mean I printed it not that 's okay I mean it 's that 's fine will appreciate it and thank you _"

    "text": "excuse us two for the price of one you know Tom good yes I really came and yep i 'm going to just presume Oh try not not Monica order cheer through the disabled here after he also surgery we 're here from the inner city east neighborhood group this morning we 're also of course we 're very closely with Tafari mutter and do support Jimmy 's comments very strongly as a neighborhood group we 're generally supportive of the proposed number of councillors and the reconfiguration except of course for the Central Ward and our concern is the same as jenny has expressed that thus the way it 's drawn now cuts our community in half and the way our neighborhood group has worked for many years we note that the word the war does extend beyond Bierly avenue and we would just like to say that for us we 've never had a relationship as anna citigroup working with sand albans but we do have a very strong relationship with the other inner-city neighborhood groups and we understand that people have sinned auburn sid in submissions that and we want everybody on the outer rings of the city to relate to the city but that 's a very different issue to living in the inner city and the issues of living and the inner city have always been well canvass by the combined and the city neighborhood groups and i think others of them will be presenting on that so i think that need that distinction needs to be made there 's relating to the city and this living in the city and these are different things whatever class structure you 're looking at there are in the city issues the area that I seeing as a brace has been traditionally from Madras through to stonewall road and that 's been a long stint I don 't know how seniors holds oh maybe twenty five twenty years online so it has had a long term interest and that particular area so it 's roughly what Jeannie called lynwood west or we would talk about as the old Linwood and the old under city limit is such a humongous area now it 's just really difficult to put they 're not similar across the whole area and for many years of course the social services have focused on that area and looked across from same address through to stand more and as Ginny said extended out to linwood avenue because of the particular vulnerability low-income needs of that area and that 's always been our focus and concern as a neighborhood groups and the needs of these people are you are often as you all know very easily overlooked and gets swamped by more articulate groups so our greed is concerned I think in this reconfiguration is what it does to the community boards and how our neighborhood will then relate to community boards we have a very good relationship with the heavy fear image community board and that 's been very responsive and we 've participated and all the processes there and that 's been easy and a really good working democracy for us as a neighborhood group and we certainly don 't want to lose that and now we do feel very concerned that the particular interest of this very low decile group will get swamped to come up particularly in let burwood coastal Linwood 's board and that 's quite rightly so they 're going to be focused on quite different things so we want to suggest that that be looked at and the same way that Jeanne has talked about that the inner city the inner city east be looked at alongside we 're a family with Boston really judgment in those kind of areas and that we be kept and that kind of configuration and I think I think when you look at it in a whole kind of way the thing that this the way these boundaries are drawn as it ignores they tend to ignore natural and traditional communities and we want to put in a play that that 's some more sympathetic way of doing that could happen and we put in the submission that there be an anti-clockwise chef but we really meet clockwise really sorry but I 'm a social worker and I 'm not very good Monica pointed out to me the car this morning I think you been colorful do I show me on the meat much with what Jeannie already presented so that 's was over our summary and Monica 's happy to answer questions yes I 'm own eyes I saw apologies the thing they ever hit a speech to give this morning enough you know the time um Andrew then fell thank you um so just to distill out from the submission from the presentation this morning on the council ward it sounds as though you 're saying that stanwell road would be a better boundary between central and Lynwood so that he goes you take account of the Ark of the community yes yeah and from a community board or viewpoint the grouping of central Linwood and possibly woolston yeah be a more appropriate thing of yours from a community board person yes yes yeah and from our point of view and not just we 're trying to look at the in the needs of the whole city and that as well and how there 's going to be some particular interests I mean we don 't need to tell you about that but we just think it 's a better it as well yeah but there 's going to be huge needs in the East that are nothing to do with us in the inner city this point in time not directly anyway I fell thanks Riley it 's a really good holistic view can I just ask you like Ginny also referred to the reluctant working relationship with the community board and yesterday we consider the possibility and we understand that it is possible to have an increased number of community board members for each each board so that would have to be across all the wards so what just in terms of hat of support for the inner-city neighborhood groups and in your group would that be helpful especially for the popular especially the populations who you referred to and I know Maria that 's that won 't be a big Spence of so the number of councillors I would expect historically we 've always dealt really well with staff 8am smith street but we 've always have this this might be the wrong answer but we always have this thing where the counselors in the head of urinary a month or three week turnaround and participation we are the community groups always have a month between meetings and so even if we have that support we 've still going to have to get to our feet really quickly to participate is that the answer that you are so in fact it might be useful I hadn 't thought time to think about it because in my experience for the relationships God and we we have work true I like that very much working at that community board level as from the neighborhood it 's really good it may that may help young and haven 't thought about it particularly we 're just thinking about it too because it 's functional for us yeah thanks ready thank you I 'm sorry le and in turn thank you um just it was mentioned in the previous submission as well that son Albans is more closely aligned with Julie papanui and then the central city how much of that do you think is habitual how much of that do you think is because it 's been like that for a long are closer I know Billy Evers the natural but it 's closer to that top end of those streets by the central city I mean we just rarely a Westminster and I can see it toy silently central city how much of it is but um I don 't know I don 't know I may I live in the inner city I 've never had anything to do with sand Albans and never in that in people that here have never been to in its any of the forums or anything to do with inner city issues and there been a lot particularly post-earthquake and we 've been involved in a lot of planning stuff with with the council and with Sarah they 've never participated and that or maybe they 've never been invited I don 't know that 's the other side is it was a complete surprise to me to hear that and certainly you know Ginny made some I think useful comments about it because she sees the there the particular focus and issues is quite different but I can 't really speak from the itself an answer I think yes it is and but to follow on from that I think too there 's been some mention the submissions that this isn 't the time to be changing things at such a you know stage of our recovery and regeneration and I that 's why I asked about the habitual thing yes if you can change it fine but is it something that people want to change yeah well we don 't feeling we don 't because we want to we we think it 's important it 's important for our particular area to keep that in a city east older than wood as i call it and together as a community and it 's you know that Tafari Roy matter as a community organization is really stunning as a you know in terms of what it does across that community and how it brings so many things together there 's probably 100 me Noma I 'm a naked Social Work academic and it 's probably one of the best examples of a community development thing in the country and all units across that the candidates biet for local lore ya know me we 've done we 've done meet and we 've had it shared with the cheese distri teeth with a do a one night and we do it another night and we 've invited I would say the northern tip of here and nobody 's ever wanted to come nobody 's ever come none of the none of their community people have participated in the organization so maybe they 'll answers your question Tony need we put it out there yeah now I picked it up no and pick it up so the afford that thing to me just sees they don 't want to participate with us you know not in a disrespectful way but it 's just about that something is good coming from thank you the young the line the stem will write if used that is the line would you take it down to fury road I know it stops of chemistry as a dog League down to fury road are you thinking because Jenny 's Jenny 's was something her idea would be to keep that mad rest Rico but its division full say that large number which is sad to expanding its bend but you 're saying actually the opposite go from stem or overage i mentioned to give that group within the central but technically it would be going it would you stop at church trip would you do the doggies well in the past when we 've applied prepare as their neighborhood group because we knew that we were over the boundary the council the higley fira me forward people that can spoke to suggested that it would be a contained area for our neighborhood okay so so we 're working within their suggestions yeah and we 've done then we do the news on ice liver months of the year and we do go in today teria what they are newsletters and things servant me I mean we haven 't talked to Ginny about it you 're joking around ething but I think that we 're probably I you know okay with supporting what works there but but want the focus really to be on the traditional and natural community yeah that fine after what you said before just as a note that 's really interesting that if their communications teams have communication plans though you mentioned before about when we put out a turnaround for three or four weeks but it doesn 't tie in with your meetings or your because you just mentioned before then you see any other a newsletter so is that a regular newsletter so you can I said um at guys Sergeant Alina months the year just for us as a no just if we can get through our business association swim in office yeah daddies either goes to 3,000 people cells yeah it 's all volunteer ya ali ya um thank you just to say that the reason script policy review has picked up on this issue and let 's clean around for about five years but we are looking at it so it 's not a new issue has been raised we just haven 't finished that work um but that was too kind help residents be more groups be more involved in the process um I just wanted to ask if you were to the dress straight and the line from them would be extended to magistrate have you thought about the developments on housing in terms of the eastern frame all the expensive apartments that I 'm city how much common LLC does those new communities do you think we have what the inner-city least the fini who knows and we 're also building the Latimer Community Housing Trust also cooling housing in that area slap amongst the posh apartments going to be interesting but just looking forward like the eastern frame I mean that 's not social or affordable house really no no no in start no it 's not and Norris nor is quite a lot of the development that 's happening say from address straight through to Fitz George it 's retinal but there 's a lot of development and there listen very big opposed a very big apartment block going right next door to their to our little social housing think so because it seems to me that the the question for us around just this boundary is dou X tinglin would further into the central today or what I mean I think I think my point of view and this is I haven 't talked about it with Jimmy particularly I would be more likely to be more inclined to see the essentials of the extended sterile road it would be more natural to me but you know locked in here modern monarchy in the past we 've had um we have a unique situation where we have world authorities loving within our community and we have really talented unique people and we all seem to muck along so these and we 've had big complex as where the housing stock the design of the housing has been pretty marginal all safe and the air Dunn 's we 've done the surveys and the average age of the people that are living in those apartments will call them are between 18 and about 28 and they have the air bridge tenancy is about 18 months this is pre youth quake so it 'll be interesting to see how people actually buy in other to the east and frame because of my understanding is that the vast majority green felt pin they don 't actually look down and see that there 's going to be high-density housing so I think that 's going to be a big one for the whole love that the city to get two groups none other than just us and just to add to that of course that from Fitzgerald avenues reduced my row now there are five new housing complexes being built this year really dense through and really dense housing I mean that and that 's interesting and it 's starting to make a social service impact or really on the community so it it 's going to be quite challenging community but I think it 's important to keep it diverse and together yeah i mean if i looked at the eastern frame and we 've had housing his own community board and they offered to provide housing gear but they were top they that that wasn 't what it was for so that we know social housing going from the eastern frame through this the rest of the central so they in fact is very little social housing in like that central it was there will be some open these challenges are failure Oh in the world 's facing these challenges and studies as we go from this density to higher density which has some environmental issues but it also means better use of the land yeah yeah and it means one of the people can live in a way there is far more productive for a city then these large sections with the all of the Spain 's are saying I know and but but look up we are not all I can say is we are not alone well I don 't like no no I mean and I lived here and I love it and I want it to be as diverse as it can possibly be I want to live in the central city again I could yeah really there in the East it 's great I definitely do what was it yelling oh I want to love is close to hagley park as poss so that it so for my sunday walks right well thank you very much for it and it was incredibly helpful thank you _"

    "text": "she 's starting sorry with Ginny welcomed in a safari Renata in curing our comments today are going to relate to the location of the inner city east and the lynwood west neighborhoods in relation to the representation or of yo and we 're at first in terms of the wards the proposed Central Ward we believe imposes an arbitrary boundary through the neighborhoods of the inner city east in the lynwood west area which there 's no relationship to the existing geographical community or to an understanding of the unique area we 're arguing you need to see it together not on the split the area is one of the older communities of Christchurch and since world war two has been one of the poorest parts of the fishing and we refer you to some of the demographics that we cite and we also say it 's an area that differs markedly from the suburbs if this proposal goes ahead the result will be to carve up and separate out this community making it much harder for its needs to be met is this will force the people and to relate to to community boards given the makeup of the proposed community boards we can 't help but see that they will have differing priorities which will further disadvantage this already marginalized area of concerned in is that the more powerful beetle organized parts of the Central Ward will intentionally dominate rendering the inner city east invisible we see that this is already evident and the material that has been put out for this consultation we note no mention has been made of the inner city east when listing the neighborhoods that make up the Central Ward while others are clearly labeled we also argue that all the sound work that has been done by the heavy fury me community boards over many years will be undone with a carving up of this community included and nurses concern that the issues of marginalization in hardship characteristics of living in this area will be buried in the more affluent areas that make up the seneschal papanui marshlands community board in terms of connectivity we also note that when crime were in richmond and pullets down schools are were closing a East we use this to highlight this was largely driven by the unter linkages that exists between those two may of these neighborhoods and we also comment that christchurch ease primary school is named christchurch ease because it focuses towards the east not across to the northwest the Lynwood ward we are also concerned that the combining of Len would be wit and the coast award into one community board will result in this board being heavily burdened by the issues of hardship flooding and coastal hazards once again the unique issues of lynwood west and the greater Linwood area will be subsumed by important debates over natural hazards we also suggest that the peering of linwood and the other two wards be as little natural connection instead we believe there is a stronger and better fit between language and more stone so in light of our concerns we suggest the following split the language fear word coast awards given the complex issues this board has to grapple with and also because we say of your unnatural foot put the lynnwood Ward together with a reconfigured Austin Lord and couple the Central Ward with Len would and error reconfigured woolston to form a community board made up of central Linwood and the reconfigured woolston if you do nothing else shift the Longwood Ward boundary west to ensure that the inner city a 's community is not our literally cut off from itself in terms of from the center to learn words we say extend so that we make one language area that at least incorporates the inner city east webbot thank you thanks Julie they 're in existence yep Pauline info next and you like no comment on the number of councillors and not behave on anything cute so an intern Thank You Ginny with us bits really helpful because I think the better councillor grant and released did this yesterday is actually look looking at where the communities of interest are going to fit within the new wards and CUNY women 's so just to clarify your suggestion enters the way and I acknowledge your long-standing involvement in the inner city and your understanding of it so is that parts of that 's an Albans central area in terms inland one is right that 's really helpful net just say say some other people come to us later and say look we we in the further north and does that sort of pepper nuit Marshall impart that they might might see themselves as a sort of lined with the central san Albans back to what would you say about their I 'm just want your comment about okay so I guess I hip an interesting situation I love in each we 're and I work in the inner city east so I have an understanding and I 've lived in st. Albans for over 30 years so I in have an understanding of the in Overland of this and Albans area and I have an understanding of the inner city east Len word area is a send Albans resident I don 't connect with a sensual researcher of the central area in what I think has been portrayed I can eat with things like sand almonds primary school with Shirley with papanui there 's a much grip with papanui high school there 's a much greater linkage in and old board at the moment then looking down and two is four we are I love living down and to the inner city aced that doesn 't seem to be any real connection Thank You Jenny that 's real helpful okay thanks tim was nice thinking you mentioned about maybe moving the the line on a map from did you mean from sofas julia across just something like stem row I would take it I would go back to summer lighten the dress treats I 'll take the other one okay go back go back to town because there that 's the traditional boarding house the old the old an assoc that goes down to learn whatever neon traditionally rolling by this yeah yeah thank you sleep yeah Thank You Jenny all that work you 've been doing on inner city housing what you 've identified as a particular kind of not only geographic but social sort of constituency what would this proposal due today it would separate out the communities and I think you know like if you were trying to F it does i can 't help but a lot of single people poor single people loving and single accommodation it tends to be an area historically has been dear you 're separating it off and you 're meaning that two boards have now got to deal with that problem and Isis fit with the issues that you 've got if you do that Ling learn would boot and beer would close to one understandably you 've got huge issues here the inner city east is just going you know those issues are going to be small in comparison and quickly become invisible yeah I think you said one board has the history of dealing with it totally new work for yes another border yes and we have to I mean we 'd have to you have to start again education and higley fearing me borders as you know that the counselors and the community board are really ensuring with it you think you fooling one more to do you need so you mentioned that they feel the air you see is a natural boundary so that we you would want to put them through boundary for thee well I would imagine that feeling even y because it 's part of the you know like part of the four even years like years I mean you 've got a you 've got your figures that you 've got to look at and I suppose it I 'm trying to compromise a little bit around it and so most probably it would be Billy Avenue would be the ideal and then across as you seduced into the dress yes and it would be using he 's he 's been doing thank you I 'm thank you for your submission um some submitters have said that we should just elect councils across three wards so for example if he took you know the proposed community board boundaries they should just be through three counts as elected at large I was just interested with a you had any comment around the issue of having local councils representing local Ward 's versus having you know more cancers spread across a wider geographic area but took there were some of the areas that you have talked about in your assumption in terms of and and and whether there should be any any concern well I think one of the reasons for the low voter turnout and Eddie rear is the sense of disenfranchisement I think if you had a counselor that 's really interested and you have been one yani and others have been in the inner city east erie I 've been willing to promote some of those are shoes it could well be advantaged to have someone it does obviously represent that view all that state board so certainly there is there but then if you 've got someone that doesn 't is through pick up i 'm in the Central Ward is an interesting one isn 't it because you 've got you 've got some very affluent areas you 've got some business part and then you but some of the poorer areas I imagine you 're more likely to get someone that 's going to represent more of the other viewpoint so it could be that the other having you know across the board as a better option who picks up some of those out of interest okay for coming on and making those points _"

    "text": "so thank you very much for them this opportunity to speak to you I felt that it was really important that you heard from residents of banks peninsula as well as organizations so what I 'm presenting now is very much my personal submission you 've seen me here in front of you a number of times as the manager of the road Donald trust I 've lived for 25 years in the upper harbour area I 've been very involved with heritage protection with the district fan over the years I run a tourism business focused on guiding people around archaria and I also run a consulting business looking at tourism issues so my view is that you 've got a really tough job here you 're trying to fit a huge round peg into a square hole and the well of all in terms of physical location but you also have a wonderful opportunity on banks peninsula if you manage it well and I think this is where it 's really important to have a voice from that Peninsula so what I 'm asking you to do is that we retain our distinct identity of our communities on banks peninsula that we develop sustainable tourism and that we harness that desire of peninsular communities to be self-determined and so I 'm looking to you to empower and strengthen our community boards as well as retaining the banks peninsula Ward and I think if you do this you 'll end up with a more effective and cheaper to run banks peninsula so I just wanted to talk a little bit about identity and what it feels like to be a peninsular resident at the moment and that is that our identity is being lost in this urban driven one size fits all model and the district plan has been a real classic case of that where we had the banks pennant to the district plan that people were on for a very long time went through all sorts of negotiations and appeals and all the rest of it most of the or many of the bank 's prints of plan provisions were not carried over into the proposed district plan it 's been an enormous amount of work for again so our historic area was left out or environmental compensation that we 'd worked on was left out why did that need to happen it 's an example of where we need our different issues to be really clearly identified the proposed freedom camping by law I have to say I think was a real shocker really failing to consider rural residents and really failing to consider our tongue to fin or so it 's another example where yet again we had to make strong submissions to try and get our voice heard and then there 's this vexing issue over signage I mean somewhere like Gawker are really trades on its charm and its unique identity see that sign there tourists are always taking pictures of those cute little street signs in a Corral but we 're kind of being forced down this path of these standardized corporate signs from Christchurch City Council and that 's not what we want in our communities we want to retain our separate identity and I also and bringing up tourism because that was a slide that I brought up after Simon 't trust submission which I 'm trying not to repeat was that the local government Commission had really seen tourism as the thing that was going to bind the city to the peninsula but in fact the issues for tourism a bit like the issues with port can be very different from your perspective as whether you 're in the city or actually in the host community so cruise tourism is an interesting example five years on it 's still trading in a Corral as an event under event management plans so where for example our school has been required to build this extensive off street bus park cutting down the beautiful cherry trees that screen the children from the road the cruise ship buses now all type right alongside the school as they marshal up so every morning on a cruise day our children are subjected to a stream of 20 or 30 buses parking outside their school an example of where tourism may be benefiting the christchurch district or region as a whole but it 's not necessarily benefiting those residents and I think the type Curren tourism think all as well and the tourism and after all but I 've been looking at it recently all our principal bed and breakfasts have closed on the mean part of akaroa we have the whole street Rouge ollie where all the businesses have shot and some of our principal our businesses like the bakery remain closed so I don 't think all as well with tourism and opera and we need that to be picked up and represented and then I think there 's also this real difference in that Peninsula people want to be self-determining we want to run our reserves we want to have reserve management committees we want to get stuck in and do stuff like working in our reserve fixing our wharves but you know right now with Worf restoration we came and gave submissions to you in the long term plan you have assisted us from the council to say yes we want to help you with that but it 's stuck at the moment we 're needing Andrew as our counselor to be that strong voice and push forward our wharf restoration community in akaroa tired of vans coming over the hill endlessly from from City you know we want those contracts being let locally and I think again andrew has been able to push for that and we also want appropriate scale solutions with local input so we don 't need gold plated the things like Stanley Park we don 't need hundreds of thousands of dollars spent on things come and talk to us we can help you to do these things far more cost-effectively through keeping it simple and doing our working bees and doing our local input and harnessing our local desire to be involved so we 're looking for more empowered local communities as being more effective for the counselor I think there 's a real difference when you on a place like thanks penance you we focus on our communities boy I mean you know Mari talk about my Hill my water we live that you know we live surrounded by hills in our water so like tongaat Afeni well we 're really connected to the land we live in and we 're really committed to making peninsula counselor and we have this poor run around counselor who 's going to manage a city ward Sumner Mount Pleasant he could and then have to come all the way out to upper or heaven forbid Laban 's bay or henna why reserve how is that person going to get around and manage it and we 're actually not going to have that voice that we 've had in andrew supporting our local initiatives so please we 're asking use the isolated community provisions of the local government act to retain the existing banks peninsula ward boundary and give more power to our community board to get on and contract out work and get things going locally i mean under banks peninsula we used to have the reserves fund that was managed by the local community boards let 's see something like that happening again and let us have a peninsula counted rabbit over there is again the wonderful andrew so that our issues and opportunities can be driven forward and i think we 'll get a win win situation out of this so yes please one extra counselor banks peninsular itself so yes you know thanks very much I think that what 's been really useful about your submission and the one before it has been to really drive up the issues around my little tone as is included and the peninsula to be honest I thought it was just about numbers but I can hear that it 's actually about a lot more than just the numbers and that certainly given me some some reason just to reinforce the requests that we 've already made Tim I 'm just two quick glance with regards to the slides with regards to that tour to my shoes are the cruise ships actually on to them as well well I think it 's an issue on which our communities divided and they 're of Theo to use and you know you have some businesses benefiting and you have other businesses not benefiting but i think my view and I 'm a business who does do tours for cruise ship passengers so I am involved with the cruise industry but my overall view is they basically its mass tourism that 's scale of community that we are doesn 't really suit mass tourism we need to be in that sweet spot of owner-operated small business tourism with people coming and staying in our community for a while doing the walks and appreciating the biodiversity and going to the museums and spending their time there and I think it would be better if the cruise ships went back to littleton and we just had the occasional cruise ship in after all but even the little the little boutique cruise ship so they arise yeah yeah they 're ideal but follow on from there regards to the the second style characterized the model is costing like livelihoods that 's right across the region of them I really isn 'ta there isn 't fully recovered from the earthquake so really talk about you know echo is better suited for small boutique type and activities that 's what you have and then that just seems with a slide the second slide you here but these as you said the boutiques frozen down twice then well I think um you know it 's interesting one cuz and i think it 's it 's happening without us kind of realizing it but i think tourism is actually picked up an opera we have a lot of tourism but i think the problem is that it 's out sourced from accommodation people are either staying in their camper vans where they 're staying in cruise ships so we need that regulatory playing field to level things up again to give our own small businesses a chance so i think that 's really what 's going on with accommodation and i think it 's also down marketing so we 've had some of our higher quality shops closing and I think there 's a view from some people that because we are sort of you know so busy with the cruise ships on some days that our bigger spenders are actually staying away so without any proper research and study you 're only going on opinion and hair say but I think there 's certainly a multiplicity of views on where those benefits are lying and I think a lot of the benefits and the cruise ships are the that that are really pulling the punters hmm le and then Phil thank you I just wanted those some you mentioned the bakery and a couple of other places and I could I I you know that they have closed as a result a result of their not being the business there or are they related in some way to earthquake and insurance issues or just fun well the bakery was really strange one because they actually burnt down burn town but I think what I see is that okay an accident happened to a business but has somebody come along and taking the least sound on it no it 's still sitting there looking you know looking for at least we 've got a beautiful bed and breakfast door knocker which has been completely restored after the earthquakes it 's sitting on the market nobody 's coming to buy it so it tells me that the demand isn 't out there you know for business so I 'm just observing that that 's what 's happening so thank you very much Sookie can I just ask you but I i inferred from what you are saying that besides having the bank 's furniture as a distinct and counsel counsel award that there would be your should also be to community boards so that the community boards they should continue is that what you yeah I think so I mean but now in my role like in my personal role I am much more involved for the upper our community that is my community that I reside in bit of my role as the road Donald trust manager I 've been working equally with both community boards and what I see is that both community for really busy with a lot of issues so I mean little tune has got its whole recovery it 's got the port it 's got the harbour it 's got diamondharbour you know there 's a lot going on and I see people like paula smith you know run off her feet managing just the Littleton mount her bit bored so I think to try and do the whole Peninsula would be really difficult for the key Sokka Nanyan too bitter for you don again you know the argument for a separate community board at the little team does get more challenging you know in terms of proximity and doesn 't have the geographic distance and it 's got a tunnel so the whole argument doesn 't quite you know work as well but would you rather see that community board combined with a corollary whoa yeah i think the other way around definitely I think you know in the peninsula as I said our hell 's our water we look inward from the Littleton crazy look into the Littleton crater that 's the community of interest and I think when you look at that landscape up there you know we we are joined together and we we 're only just beginning to really tap into the potential of the peninsula as a unified land of that 's the opportunity for Christchurch 's really to make something off the peninsula so I think that if you do that then you really have to make sure that community board meets in the different locations that people can go and make their representations and it will 't want to see our independent service entrance so give you another another question I had two in relation to that was you mentioned specifically about empowering and strengthening community boards and the example I think you gave was the reserves found that the exponential boards have I just wondered because in fact after this review we are as account so we 're going to be looking at besides we 're commute the structures of community boards what new delegations we may be able to support them worth I just wonder if you 've got any suggestions around that additional factor because you mentioned like the reserves fund that the potential whatever you 've got any suggestions from outside the boards as to what what other delegations or areas that they might be able to be strengthened with so I was a community board member for the alcohol or whatever would under bank Spencer I know the frustration of being a community board member that you feel so helpless that you you know you keep having these meetings but you never really seem to get anything done and certainly the to determine what happened or at least make you know strong advice about our our reserve sponge so we could make the decisions as a local community board we 're going to spend in fact I think that was my proudest achievement as a community board member was the steps up from the beach in devotion to the Nile point track you know and we contracted basically we controlled the contracting out of that and I think that as a start but I think when you 've got the really remote ward like I Cora the local contracting that Andrew has been looking at and cover more than just parks and reserves it could cover our public facilities as well put that back in the hands of the locals again and all these grumbles about things don 't even need to come to your table they can be sorted out in a local community and we can cost-effectively supply those services thank you indeed it does sound a griever model thank you android last question sousuke thank you very much indeed for the excellent presentation would your view of either real community board as two separate entities or the two community boards combined as one pan banks peninsula community board would you see that and do you think the community would see that as some kind of community council that was able to deal with a lot of peninsular issues that to use your own words wouldn 't need to come near this table yeah I think I think if I felt feel like I 'm a bit like being cross-examined by the lawyers here and they end up in a corner but I think that it is definitely we value as a community the ability to talk to a group of people who understand what we 're talking about so when we talk about something you know what we 're talking about on the community board I think of a big ask for a community board to run around that whole great bigger area but if the flip side of it is that they 're actually empowered to get on with the work and they have that sense of we 're actually doing something useful here then I think and I think we 'll get more able people standing for the positions so I think we would win if we empower our community boards whether we have one board or two I think I will leave that to this forum to to negotiate my preference would still be that we had to I mean at the moment they do meet together for a combined meeting so I think the peninsula of community boards have found their own way of going every now and again we have big Pam peninsular issues that we need to talk about but a lot of the time we 're dealing with you know our own parochial issues we don 't need to waste the little some people 's time talking about the toilets and Laban 's Bay you know hmm think you could 've oh thank you it 's actually been incredibly helpful and I just think the combined effect of all of the submissions that we 've had today has writ certainly opened up our eyes to the range of issues that we need to take into account as we get to the making the effort to come and make the submission thank you very much for your time all of you and so yet you all have a very hard job now so keep going will do alright so I think I 'll just a June the meter until tomorrow morning at nine o 'clock _"

    "text": "on it Simon Simon more lockers is joining sick as well ride a bull prep PowerPoint presentation we 've seen today okay I think we know we think we know and we understand our be exponentially community with we talked to the community the farmers that local businesses the conservation groups the organizations such as dark and a farmer Canterbury as well as council course and so we think we know and understand that community pretty well in the last five six years we 've been operating and we think that the reissue is going to be about effective representation of a community of interest so they 're the two key expressions effective representation community of interest so today I 'll be talking about what does that community of interest and how do you achieve effective representation and before I sort of kick off our would like to say one point about about the previous comments with the earlier speaker and that is that we 're talking about thanks potentially here and that is one a unique environment and when you see it from space or from from from the I don 't think that the solution would have been dividing at between Salman and Luca city you would have seen all the opportunities that are going to flow through banks financial are lost if it would have been been divided into two parts basically specialists that we only the we can only achieve effective representation and their community of interest by retaining the banks will award within the current boundaries we see no sort of second place in that outcome that recognizes that 50 if you were not to do that fifty-nine percent of the population would count that that would be outside the current water they sponsor fifty-nine percent so you 've got forty-one percent it effectively lose the majority of the population outside the current ward and we as a result we would lose that unique voice the banks peninsula would be drowned out and not necessarily count the same extent as it would secondly the proposed would does not take account of the banks peninsula size legislation we 've heard about that and issues that are common to be exponentially do not concern fifty-nine percent of competing interests and talent country dividing the container country divided so what does this test of effective representation is there a community of interest but thanks thanks Peninsula is distinct issues our rural tourism and conservation rural and sense that we 're dealing with largely a farming community we 're dealing with roads of a rural nature as opposed to urban nature we 're dealing with infrastructure that is very much of a rural nature and the tourism well that is just we 'll talk further about tourism but that 's an important aspect of the distinction from the council from the city and of course conservation which is going to become a larger part of their particular area banks lunch to conservation and we 're talking about there are such things as the world geo park which we are promoting longer but other initiatives with Rome 's taking secondly it comprises thirty percent sorry 30-plus separate communities no other urban or suburban community has 30 separate communities within its boundaries and it 's 36 times the size of a city ward 36 times now in terms of rural and the screen first of all is the for real angle with them with cultural issues and sites all of those demand separate attention sustainable tourism we 're having issues about that with the exploitation of tourism with the ships coming in harmonizing landscape and with farming use that 's a big issue over there biodiversity protection and ecosystem restoration against a big issue marine protection and overfishing and pollution we 're dealing with that heritage term character particular areas all those committees have their own character heritage character a uniform unfair i 'll inform legal roads that gain this a big issue going forward and particularly surrounding a questions of access and landowners rights we 've got of its issues about stream and springfed water supplies and water quality merle routing and remote beach access rural depopulation we 've got it some areas we got to fall in population we want to encourage regrowth and population and the issues like maintaining schools and services and desire for local engagement basically is a strong desire for local engagement all of those issues there I would hazard a guess don 't feature those awards there they 're all unique to the banks peninsula thank you space please it 's a rural environment these are complex calculate a collection of district committees of community site as say there 's 30 separate communities each with their own infrastructure issues every single one of those communities his looks at their own infrastructure issues as opposed to looking at as I as a within a city wards you would expect each faces of a claim potentially in their population we 're trying to promote growth in their population thirdly we 're looking at fragile communities isolated from the city things like tourism for example in those isolated communities look at our number of shops that are remaining open that expanding the users know they 're basically falling behind and of course each have is something to celebrate so what binds these isolated communities together obviously it 's the topography you look at it there you can see it a sense of place they all have this sense of place where they relate to you so people in Accra relate to people in Littleton just as much the same extent people in Christchurch the love of the landscape well let 's take the obvious history they all got a fairly common history of struggling communities common issues desire for community involvement and potentially they were all now 's thinking pan peninsula the rod Donald trusts now extending out towards the Dalton Basin as much as the air caraibes basin in the wild side so we 're thinking as a pen peninsula basically forty-one percent so the size and sorry the size and location does matter thanks lad no going but this is the 36 feet hip width 36 times the size including with yep it one back yep that 's right they won this 36 times the Kashmir city war just demonstrates yes the Kashmir sit in wallet size 1 there 's the all the risk communities you can fit within that 36 1 it 's one of ours to cross from the front to the end that 's going one way of course we try to get back thanks Nick boners terms of population forty-one_,_459.51 percent of the population remains with them the bank 's Lynch 's the weather lies the existing representation does work in spite of the significant logistical challenges and issues divisive issues of the faces and the Andrew would turn mm-hmm I 'm just saying this could be injuries promotion well in the end has done a very good job he 's an excellent charming up I couldn 't agree with you more we 're thrilled with the representation we 're getting over there but I mean look space somebody just said it looks like a dating with well I always say as this is all the issues he 's had to face in the bank 's blaster we 've we 've felt that we 're being represented now you know is running with damn scared that we 're going to lose Andrew for someone from someone oh you know why this being typically parochial but I mean this there was a community of interest and he recognizes that and he rips instead yeah sorry I mean the gist of it is this i suppose and speaking is it work without going through the through my notes an earlier speaker talked about expression corporatization of democracy basically the whole concept behind the board size council is based on the concept that this is a corporate organization well it works to a certain degree but it can 't override the need for proper representation fair representation and community of interest and just because you have one less board member doesn 't necessarily say you 're going to get effective more effective outcomes around the table I think what leads this council more particularly as the fact that you will get on together they agree to differ that had made agree to accept differences of opinion than views rather than the numbers of the council 's on the table and democracy demands a better outcome than suddenly corporate izing it and the way it has I think the most important thing for me is and for the right Donald trust in particular is that this community has got significant challenges ahead of it it is to take full advantage of tourism in this community which we advance which is going to provide an employment and economic advantages for that community it 's got to to solve its problems but it wants a voice in that council but I can 't expect council-owned to do it and it 's got to be the class example to be the walkways we 're visiting being a major part of the tourism initiative the walkways and cycleways this is a local initiative this has got to the farmers committee we 're going to work those farming communities we 're going to work with those communities to actually deliver those walkways they 're not going to accept a solution from Christchurch they named a septic solution that is homegrown in terms all the services infrastructure issues that 's local that 's not a ward or a city city water suburban or urban water and more particularly of all of course is that people about representation it 's not about the ten percent weather plus or minus it 's about the isolated communities having a voice which they recognize as being unique to that community we are banks potential at first and foremost we will promise that when we amalgamated that we would have that that point now we accepted would only be based on a change in the demographics the bank splinter changing issues that would give rise to possibly an either we became more urban than more suburban in this outline the reverse has happened the reverse is needed we are basically reliant out now on our own initiatives to take things forward Thanks thank you i mean i 'll just i 'll start with the local government commission ruling in 2009 and and basically it stated that this decision which was to allow the retention of the bank 's minute reward is not an enduring justification for the retention of the bank 's punch award we were told that current arrangements introduced with the 2006 reorganization which was the merger of banks mantra and krychek city have helped to integrate thanks lunch with christchurch city and a change would be seen as the rest of that however they 're a growing community of interest linkwood linkages but you 've made the point that that they for physical reasons just simply will never be established and but that we should give careful consideration to these as part of done what we 've been asked to do which is to give careful consideration to that the reaction though has been interesting because it 's been equally as strong on both sides of the port helps so it 's been the case from banks branches are pretty much well university a desire to retain the existing boundaries but also the same and Sumner and the the other suburbs along along the other side of the peninsula there but basically essentially saying to us well you know that we our community of interest is being split as a result of that decision so you know where we are taking advice from staff as to whether we should be reviewing that position and putting up a stronger case to the local government commissioner I guess that what I 'm hearing from you is that the role of trust would support us adopting that because I should exactly is how do you be fair to say this is not something about physical isolation it 's about cultural isolation the differences at cultural differences and different issues that focus our attention on on our that was the view then if things changed but as i said things haven 't_''_831.72 changed for the better that we haven 't got closer ties with in earthquake in between someone taken to focus of the city away from banks peninsula yes we 've had to do it ourselves and I think we 're only going to be able to do it ourselves going forward so we need that be effective voice from the table and put lolly if this is a vote of confidence in our counselor well it is because it reflects that we we 've seen the better the opportunities that rose from his representation yeah no I don 't think it would be regarded as a reflection on on accounts that I think every single one of us would agree that Andrew has been an effective representative so um Yanni and then Paul Jamie oh sorry it looked like you did thank you I 'm thank you for the submission I 'm still really interested because when you go through the issues that you rise many of those issues could be faced with other areas you 've got a rural area you 've got land use issues in terms of coring you 've got a whole bunch of issues around the board and I 'm interested when you you presented the numbers that little certain actually determines the outcome of the election because it 's got its twice as much population as a garage so I 'm still trying to understand how you make the case that little term when it 's quitting it to the city center than many other parts of the Christchurch urban city and it has a major metropolitan s it like the pool which is not local infrastructure but is actually metropolitan then probably regional significant how you make that case for littles and being having separate representation I think the point is this that so littleton is obviously not as isolated as the rest of the banks peninsula but two things there first of all is that it 's not only about physical isolation as i pointed out i think the people in littleton would regard themselves as not with in christchurch if you ask the majority people in that could separate cultural issues that any particular needs you need to that particular area and i think that lilten has benefited from that sense of isolation in some ways but ironically enough they see themselves as a quarter-cent community within banks lunch line but i thought and the ceiling is that thanks if that was the choice we would have had the solar insolation bit of split thanks much to do in the middle but we can only make banks bunch of work as a whole we can 't cut it in half it 's like least berlin west berlin it only operates as a is effective city by a combined city and so into a combined place so it 's not only simply because about whether Luther that should be part of Christchurch or not it really is about whether little turn to be part of banks glandular which it should be so i think it 's it 's missing the point i mean in terms of you know the airport people living out of the airport has their own unique issues well it 's true everyone is this is you all those issues are you you need to all those people with a banks peninsula so with an award you would in terms of out by the airport obviously a very small proportion of that Ward would have issues about the airport but terms banks pollution we all share the common view common arguments common common concerns be on in and that is that the role of the representative from littleton is to support the residents of littleton the christchurch city has its interest in the littleton quarters the shareholders of support group but it 's the voice from the residents that can be an encounter when the port is doing things that are harming the residents like you know noise or cold I 've store those many issues whereas if your representative from littleton is going to be elected from somewhere which they will be under this proposal or from the city side of the hill then your representative is somebody who 's not affected ya understand i but can 't the people in a corolla say the same thing that that person that gets elected the door no I disagree i think well I you 've answered I don 't think you 've answered the question he 's actually saying that the untrust are actually she she yeah and I think you 're seeing across the peninsula and I the rod don 't trust our current discussion has been women with project little example is a good example they see it as a only the walking festival this pan peninsula and we see it a very much commonality of interests mmm Jamie and um thanks Sookie and Simon um I 'm just on the other side of the coin with us so I hear what you 're saying around things modular as an isolated community but obviously with the representation review the nature of it is there 's a domino effect so what 's your view then on higley ferry made seeing as you 're advocating for pets the sumner area to do it to remain a metropolitan sermon I think that 's your phone what are you phoning your friends a look terms of look I don 't know I guess the question is splinter is an isolated community functions I think hagley ferry me is like the airport situate scenario I think weathers there 's a roughly modest a number of percentage of the population that falls within the war was in the rural community raised oppose this but here we 're talking about a dominant position of the superb suburban community of writing the interest illsley not my own a minority 41 since still of the rural community but I mean look I 'm not a fan of trying to reduce the numbers of councils around this table I think I support the previous speaker I just think that you guys are doing great job as I say the real problem is not whether you 've got too many as but hey we together yeah hmm I agree thanks well it seems like an extremely positive note to ignore thank you very much Sookie do you want to make a presentation of your own

    "text": "patient we 've asked staff to provide us for some advice about the about the potential for retaining the existing boundaries and also maybe a fallback position as well so that we 've got some other options too to consider in this area that 's very positive thank you thank you for the opportunity of addressing my submission today my comments will be brief I attended at least three meetings in a Corolla about the proposed review of boundaries and words but unfortunately I through the paperwork away since it was assumed to be a fait accompli my understanding is that the local government commissioners indicated to Christchurch City Council that banks peninsula would lose its status as an isolated community with no other recourse or option available that 's how it was presented to us anyway at the meetings as you can see the first map was accurate in terms of scale the distance from the city to a Corolla and the outer Bay 's is roughly 60 to 100 kilometers and driving time is around 90 minutes or more making meetings in town or a borough requires at in petrol costs plus parking of applicable in town surprisingly as a key tourist attraction and international destination a Corolla does not even rate a red star in the consultation information produced by the Christchurch City Council many of you have driven over the hilltop and everyone stops to marvel at the fantastic view of the stunning a corolla harbor but in reality this is what we see during the winter when the highways empty of tour buses and camper vans as peninsula what residents welcome to our world the local government Commission allowed banks peninsula the status of an isolated community for a period of nine years after Banks Peninsula district council was formally abolished the Commission has withdrawn the status without an explanation even though nothing has really changed or altered my guess is that government intends to streamline and downsize everything into super cat super sized councils with large words without giving due regard to the Act of Parliament provisions which are to provide for the effective local government that recognizes the diversity of New Zealand communities and provides for local authorities to play abroad role in communities taking a sustainable development approach under Turner knows all too well the problems that face a Corot on banks peninsula because he drives the miles and makes the effort to be informed on a first-hand basis a single councillor based in the Summoner area will have their own problem on top of dealing with the CBD issues the rebuild and addressing the needs of peninsula residents one councillor representing Summoner and banks peninsula cannot be expected to cover all the details because of the distance and distinct needs and differences of rural communities what looks good on a piece of paper may not provide effective representation to remote and isolated communities on banks peninsula in conclusion prior to making a decision it would be prudent to review the evidence and carefully consider all the reports that were considered by the local government Commission to determine that banks peninsula is no longer an isolated community and all the council reports that proved that by eliminating the camp the counselor for banks peninsula the same level of service and representation will be maintained for ratepayers living in rural communities around banks Turner and the accra why we would commune bored trigger commitment to the communities of banks peninsula thank you Andrea I guess you 'd like to start well I 'd like to start by thanking you Victoria for your kind words and as I 've often said one of the things that makes my role as manageable as its able to be is the strong relationship I 've got with Pam Richardson and the acura variable community board is the strong relationships with the two community boards on peninsula that that make the job manageable I 'm interested in the submission talks about keeping the status quo and doesn 't talk about any other ways of mitigating the effects of the proposal that we put out for consultation but you 're certainly describing as as negative for the peninsula or not conducive to good representation for the peninsula if we ended up with a situation where we were looking at the existing banks peninsula Ward plus for example the heath cup valley or plus for example just some nerve rather than the whole larger extension was proposed in the model be something in your view that would be acceptable to you and turtle peninsula residents or is it really you 're saying to us just keep things the way that they are I think if you were to consider another proposal of a different ward structure you 're simply moving the duct chairs around on the Titanic what works works we are separate we are isolated during the earthquakes we got along reasonably well because we were self-reliant and totally cuddle for several days the city certainly had its own problems and our damage was fairly minor when compared to what everyone went through in the city but we were able to survive because we are self-reliant we are self-sufficient and we became basically an isolated community and I think you have to recognize the fact that it 's a huge land mass in a difficult highway at best even in good weather in good weather then you have to deal with all the crazy visitors driving on the highway plus the tour buses and camper vans I think at best we are an isolated community and nothing in my the reports that the local government commissioner is reviewed to alter their position because I I don 't know what has changed and a further question if I can on the community board arrangements clearly the proposal has got the existing ocurro why real community board retained and we we had some discussion and some debate about that before we went out with this proposal if we were to look at I 'm not saying we necessarily would but if a proposal were too because but we looked at a banks peninsula community board rather than having the two separate community boards for little to manhood but necro my real one what would your view of that thing I would actually like to see the littleton community community board retained also i think both community boards have different aspects that they deal with littleton is not as rural you have more access to the city but they still have their own problems a lot of problems in terms of rebuilding and rebuilding communities i would like to see both community boards retained if at all possible and i don 't think the cost is all that great when you consider representation when you consider democracy which is how we function hopefully and that would allow both communities both of akwa littleton those two more or less separate communities to maintain their representation through the community boards directly into council thank you very good I 'm yani sent two questions one um I understand the argument that you put forward for eka robbing an isolated community I struggle to understand how to make that same argument for a little something I don 't think that it takes longer probably too dark and some know when you brighten into the central city than it would from here too so I would agree with you on that point in a perfect situation i 'd like to see little tender retain their community board it may not be reasonable and I I do agree also in that it is a much shorter drive and far more accessible for the people in the Littleton area to access town facilities and they 're not going to have the same hindrance of bad weather and roads shut but I realize it may not be possible I think it 's very important for Acura on the outer base to maintain the level of representation that we currently have and then my second question was if if it was decided that we would like to keep egg peninsula as the existing water a few tweaks if to do that we had to increase the number of councillors in the urban area to try and get the population ratio is having less deviation is that something that you 'd support I think you 're struggling and you 've done a fantastic job over the past few years and I would like to commend this council on its hard work and the fact that you 've worked together through some very very difficult issues and you you still have a long ways to go and I don 't think it would be a bad thing to have a few more elected representatives to help shoulder that right and I really object strongly to this ethos a streamlining one size fits all it 's doesn 't Canterbury has been through a dramatic it 's not a matter of money it 's a matter of actually having a direct link to your constituents and letting us be heard via our elected representatives so that 's fine with me I think 10 years ago if you looked at the council it was a different ball game altogether you 've moved way beyond that and you 've done a lot of work so I think in fairness it would be nice to see a few more counselors felt Thank You Victoria and we had a submission just earlier this afternoon where the submitter suggested that we consider having tweety Ward 's or Twitty counselors and while that 's much further than we have considered it just strikes me that in fact if ever council was to do there in fact the wards would come back to bmore the size in terms of population of banks financial assay so how would you view that in terms of it actually working with a lot with a bigger number of councils I think the rapiers would probably I mean I personally would see it as being very positive I think that 's what local democracy is all about how do you think the ripe has is are you were going to say the right pass would what was the revolt the next food no no I certainly would not know I know that I 've it again I think I 've watched the council very carefully now for 20 years through banks peninsula and now christchurch city and i congratulate all of you on the job you 've done in the past few years prior to this my interaction with the council was not so positive but you are lightyears ahead of where we were so i 'd say well done and a few more counselors if that would actually enhance representation throughout Christchurch would be a good thing but the model that we 've got now has given you what you believed to be effective representation yes you know I would strongly object if we were to lose them yep yep saw that I mean I hope that my signal to you earlier is there 's some comfort in that regard so i 'll be doing some felt very strongly that we were given a steer from the local government commotion but of course the local government Commission 's membership has changed and the law has changed and it may well be that given our unique circumstances there may be a way that we can you know extend the that the deviation is that we 're from the from the norm beyond the 10-percent plus or minus I I would invite the local government Commission to come to a parole and spend half a day maybe we should organize the yeah because they have no idea it 's it 's a piece of paper to them but when you see the road conditions and what we have to put up with it 's something entirely different yeah I mean it 's a huge challenge but essentially a large urban City Council has taken over the for his merged worth a small rural component of all council that perhaps if at the time it had been reviewed rather than as a political decision but as a practical decision part of which would have gone to sell one and well I think also the first proposal failed because the people in Christchurch voted against it a try the second one succeeded because christ church had no say in the second proposal actually is a democratic no I objected to it in principle yeah but there were strong political motivations you find it it 's why I see it if it wasn 't a political decision then perhaps it would have been you know split so that a rural community would have stayed with the rural council with the expertise in their area and the connections around the lake there and and the Little John connection would have been reestablished between the hills so but but I think too in fact it was a political decision as to why little sutton was ever papua thanks a lot to your first place but i think to in fairness there has been a close association between the people in the city and a corona and veins peninsula for generations there 's no question about that i mean the vast number of temporary population that occur or experiences are actually Christchurch residents who thank you very much and thank you for coming over and in making such an effort to present the position I hope that the solution that we come up with will be something that will be worthwhile thank you very much thank you next we have the rod Donald banks punch _"

    "text": "I welcome thank you this submission is for me it 's also supported by the reckless residents association local government Commission guidelines identify three key factors that must be taken carefully into account by the council they are communities of interest and which is a fire trailer prime position in considerations effective representation of communities of interest a fair representation of electors my submission which specifically refers the ferry madaria involves all three of these factors and in seeking a suitable solution to the issue draws upon other elements including wood size and councillor numbers i read the city council 's representation review final proposal and note that it proposes 16 councillors and 16 wards and seven community boards during preparation for the code provides proposal council offers identified a strong desire among electors for smaller Awards better reflecting communities and more counselors and banks minute to the participants in particular was strongly in favor of their status quo in other words 11 ward for the expenditure with one councillor into community boards I note also that the council wishes to move from the existing number of metropolitan electors councillor of 16 and a half thousand this of course number of 60 and a half thousand is inflated beyond a real average by the council by councils having very high numbers to achieve this in Christchurch do it need to be 21 or 22 councillors the current proposal therefore takes is only part of the way we regret to reward geography thanks Fidentia with a population of 8580 is the obvious exception to the general rule it 's at least five times the size of christchurch by mr. christchurch combined probably ten times as you 've started out as mr. price Futures and it 's predominantly ruggedly rural and sparsely settled apart from for dormitory settlements around on sand harbor and Dalton itself there 's little community of interest with the wards that make up the rest of christchurch i would def will support a single ward for banks furniture with one councillor and to community boards as there are environment but in view of the dependence upon the city by lyttelton harbour residents award comprising banks potential with its most connected city communities namely heathcott sumner reckless in our acceptable that 's very much as the current proposal except to councillors as the commercial parts of fira meet are of critical importance of the coastal hill suburbs and the residents of parameter probably other is apparently probably have a closer relationship director served by main right infirmary bridge then to elect as anywhere else it would be appropriate to include ferry meet in the bank 's financial our littleton some net cetera Ward ferry me disinfect awards activity center with its supermarket shops and other other other service facilities idea for recommend that ferry me be incorporated into the Sumner reckless Mount Pleasant the set reward there shall be a sudden of banks peninsula walk with three community boards and two counselors there should be generally at least 19 and preferably 21 councillors communities of interest should dominate the allocation of water and consideration should be given to a 19 or 20 Ward model with 20 counselors attached below chart showing a 20 walls proposal and i have attached there one which says 20 wards it 's a ella stration not a working model are there any questions kristen certainly interesting and that seems to propose keeping banks peninsula exactly as it is a moment with one elected member that 's one of the things that doesn 't come through strongly in your written submission a lot of the information you give in the written submission is around the assumption that the banks peninsula summon award will go ahead as proposed and you discuss through the representation arrangements for that Ward and then you talk about faerie meet has been the key activity center of commercial center for that Ward which I 'm sure holds true for red cliffs or Keith Kurt all those areas on that side of the hills do you have a view on whether ferry meet would have a strong community of interest or would be seen as the key activity center for areas on the existing expert in the existing banks peninsula Ward like for example diamondharbour portly the governor 's bail at a river otter are no i don 't i think that it 's very much the activity center for the three coastal hill suburbs impossibly heath good but not for the straight into town yeah I 'm Yanni and then Jimmy thank you um thank you for your submission come I just you 've obviously requested for a greater number of councillors does does the lack of an elected you can have any waiting in your argument in terms of having like a lack of like an elected EK don 't agree that that 's really something that we can take into account yo well except um you know well I did not fall though perhaps I should make it a little strong that isn 't something we can take into account when considering our representation review so please just don 't please spend your time asking a question that 's relevant to the representation review yeah I was just interested whether the issues that you 've identified in terms of having a greater number of councillors weather because and I mean the Messner Romero order button because we don 't don 't don 't don 't don 't trifle with it yeah what what I 'm trying to say what I 'm trying to say is that asking a submitter genuine submission that has utterly compliant they 're standing orders to have you ask a question that then takes them outside of our standing orders is just somewhat unfair so i 'll move to Jimmy germania thank you based on your recommendation if the council of you know is increased to either 20 or 21 counselors but what 's your point of view regarding to the council staff to support those the elected members and also how to share that the community facility sh 0 i can really speak for my own suburbs and therefore the model that i put up it doesn 't really address how one would split up the rest of the city with a larger number of councillors but it seems the possible thing to do is it 's gone from the is it 13 or 14 characters to 16 with a pretty convincing sort of breakup model with a fuse edges to be sorted out like I think Harry Reid for example but I do think that we I would certainly support having more councils because that gives councillors more chance to represent their electors that councillors hedrick a rather powerless to take note of what their electors are saying to them personally or directly when faced with trying to sort something out with the city bureaucracy the point that you make around very made and its location and importance to the Summoner communities in the community where you are Mount Pleasant and is probably equally important to the Brookhaven community which were paid submissions on this morning as well because people tend to go that way for you know the supermarket and you know yes yeah so it 's it 's it seems to be more the hub for that area it could well be the Brookhaven should be within the wood as well yes so sweet because once once we start doing this based on the existing thanks lunch or inclusion then it starts to get unwieldy and big and and and we start to break into problems about not having you know Farrah presentation across the city so if we were able to find a way of you know presenting an argument that in fact banks lunch or should be standalone because that you 've raised in your submission would you favor a more focus ward you know based on those extended communities around sit but seeing ferry meters the hub rather than seeing it at the tail end of of award yes i would i would support that the other because the current proposal the proposal has banks furniture as part of a sunday etc would that would be acceptable but i think we should be two castles for it right okay there any other questions it 's like a look thank you very much and do appreciate the time that you put onto it on coming on personally much appreciated thank you thank you and dear dream again _"

    "text": "even his Curtis tree you could I trust Tanya Jenkins and Bill something 's here hello you don 't even look like Tanya Jenkins oh no no no no there was a change last moment change sorry I 've probably got it written down somewhere if I could find my piece of paper she would have done with it well dearest yes I didn 't know that you were coming so I do apologize right far away right so my name is bill Simpson I 'm the chair of the Avon Heathcott history a hoot I trust or more commonly known now as the history trust and basically what we 're asking for is for the even here to get history trust a citizen and the proposals to be split between three wards rather than the one that 's been considered at the moment the one being considered moment is that it 's aligned with the coastal ward so the three wards that we 're proposing would be the coastal Linwood and the B expansion of some rewards in our reasoning is that there is no single community of interest that have interests in the history depending on where they are and their connection to the history so those main main communities if I give you some of the names of the suburbs for example if we look at south shore south bright and new brighton bexley area which is the proposed coastal ward they would have an interest in the image from our recreational flooding protection aesthetics point of view however if you looked at the wolf 's turn on ferry meteors the e return the Easter it quite different so they would be more concerned about transport I 'd be concerned about contamination from the health care river and also about flooding and then again if you looked at the third area which is the Mount Pleasant McCormick 's babe makes bay area in the ear interest again are quite different and they have a different need for recreational which is linked in with the coastal pathway and in the aesthetics of Esther reviews as well if just one community board was responsible for the history then that would place quite a burden on that board as it not really part of its own community just to give you an example the history truster is currently working on a restoration project on the edge of mccormicks bay so we with the Nets done with City Council operations staff too but under the proposal instead of us relating to the Hagley ferry meet board which we do at the moment for for help and assistance for information flow and so on then the that would be under the coastal board community board or the community board is a social web associated with the coastal ward but they would have little interest in that community because it 's on the other side of the history from them right so I think they they wouldn 't give it the air teaching that it would it would be jus then there are a lot of other issues such as the access for the yachting Club sober it makes baya Mount Pleasant now why would a community board which is lured that area be interested in those sorts of issues now note that there are several areas and these are admittedly suburban areas you look at woolston south then that appears in both the lynnwood bill would coastal board area as well as the sprayed and whilst in kashmir board area and similarly the healthcare valley is in both the littleton summer ball area as well as the sprayed and washed in Kashmir will hear him now that may be a division of streets within Wilson South but we would like sort of similar treatment I guess they even hit get history so just in summary were saying that the interest of the history are relevant to the actual communities which are adjacent to the history and that we would like to see a shearing of the history among several boards as as it is now thank you very good I 'm David East so thank you Bill are you advocating then that we sort of find a mid point in the history and radiate out the three directions that would be the best solution if you look at the current with the current situation there is a dividing line between the heck the ferry meet board and the Burwood Peters 's board history so you swede look at a some sort of situation if I may then you see the link is on the trust of that the history seen as the kidney of the city and to which both rivers feed so to have it fall in one way or the other I 'll be helpful so I guess they have both that 's what you say bill true yeah thanks yeah if there are major issues that do need an integrated approach banks I mean many community you know several community boards then we would probably be an organization that would realize that and we 'll take it to the council or at least make sure the community boards and dividual you 're talking to each other about that issue yeah any other questions I just wrote down one of your comments because I just thought it really summed up something that we obliged to really consider combines not communities that communities of interest but communities with an interest and the history and all of those as interested different it 's a really really good point thank you great thank you um christopher darden _"

    "text": "hi I 'm serum a two-person voluminous residents association and thanks for the opportunity to come today and provides more context to the submission there are no that you 've already read um my apologies first of all for the typo in our submissions saying that we preferred a 1 and 1600 ratio for councillors it should have been one in six and sixteen around but if you 're up for one in 1600 it would be instance I don 't think the city could afford to pay for their menu counselors it 's worth a shot at that happen so I guess the main pointers that we 'd like to take this opportunity to reiterate our concealer that the Lord boundaries as they currently appear seem to be based strictly on population rather than keeping communities together or linking like-minded communities which we believe is at odds to the council 's to clear commitment to strengthening our communities this is evidenced by the current proposal to spot 24 communities in total across Christchurch to allow numbers to define the wards we 're not convinced that the three ward model per head of population may have been increased the community board members increase is debatable and least we we previously had five and now we have six for a much larger area combining the competing priorities of three awards instead of tow we believe is bound to create tension in potential factions is the same amount of time effort in resources will now be split amongst three wards instead of two where the community boards are not comprised of awards with similar interests these issues are bound to be exacerbated we wonder if there is a suggestion that an increased time commitment for the three Ward model will be required in will there being and quite increased equivalent and the stipend to community board members to make up for their increased time in which case has this costs been considered of the three ward model where to be adopted we would propose there in order to strengthen communities and utilize the common links and relationships already formed that following groupings would provide a more cohesive approach burwood coastal marshlands lynnwood woolston central Pendleton rakuten pepper no II here wouldn 't leaving the others as we realized that from a purely numbers perspective that some of the above proposed groupings would mean that we would be potentially some need to revisit currently proposal would boundaries we acknowledge that we have not provided alternative boundaries as we 've not been privy to the population data to enable us to do this however we see some obvious areas of conflict and the current model particularly we governance of natural resources is at risk for example Travis wetlands is proposed to be split between burwood in marshland in yet boumediene Martians are currently proposed to be unto secret community boards so you have one resource being debated by six different wards we also note that the council has leave to alter the representation formula for each individual area is evidenced by the allocation of significantly increased representation than the area except rewards so we ask that there be consideration given to a list formulaic approach and instead the individual community needs of different areas of Christchurch be considered we do support the need for a realignment and we understand that a to ward model a cost however we believe this is the best approach given the increasing population of Christchurch in the ongoing challenges for specific communities continuing to recover from the challenges of the last few years we want to ensure that we not only recover effectively but that we have the resources to ahead in ensure future growth in opportunity and our communities looking forward thank you thank you that 's very helpful submission for a lot of reasons and don 't don 't freak about not having the mesh block numbers and interfaces when we added up the numbers we know that that some of those groupings going to be quite large oh yeah but it may be that that just by a shifting of a line and and some realignment to make sure that we don 't split communities of interest because you know that 's what we 're looking for is have we got the communities of interest right and your comments around Travis country are very important hmm so I think that 's I mean it 's a very strong argument to not split a community of interest of saying that they 're more associated with the Burwood end of the of the map rather than the Martian Lyndon Johnson versus oh yeah but but it was a great great submission really was so Phil just a question look thank you view submission you 've also made a comment in relation to areas that will community side which had greater needs that their community boards have greater resources or increased resources compete with others yes we we were of the understanding that each community board is provided with the same budget and we had some concerns that there are obviously some areas within the city that have a long way to go in terms of the ability to rebuild their communities in strengthen them following the earthquake and that we you know without warning to you know take all of the resources in Christchurch we do believe that there is still needs increase resourcing thank you in the mural I 'd saito we 're going to be looking after after this review we 're looking at the delegations for community boards thank you there any other questions let and thank you for making the effort to come on and make it the submission in person it does make it real so it 's very much appreciated thank you right there next _"

    "text": "yeah Mount Pleasant memorial community center and residents association munda what coming have a very strong community is interested thank you q hora counselors thanks for the opportunity to talk to this representation review today if you don 't know me I 'm Linda Rutland I 'm the paid is quite recovery coordinator for now present for the for the community center a present Calla little like being here today because i 'm not sure but of a holiday our association just so you know as got approximately 300 paying members and we provide services through the community center to population of 4,000 and in communities outside that so for example Brookhaven which has no community center or any such facility my job description title is earthquake recovery cornejo 's map map business still very much in recovery mode we have made with many homes still requiring demolishing hundreds needing rebuilding and many people still and insurance to scoot we can see regeneration coming but it 's some time away from any of their residents we would normally have done a better job of informing our residents about this really I handling really fall with rebuilding at the center itself so um yeah I had got some supporters here there and so the background the writers of the submission would like to acknowledge that the current council and community board representation over the last term has been excellent we 've never felt better represented than what we had been over this tomb that 's both both community board members and by councils I 'm however we 've got three major concerns with the current proposal which centers on effect of reference representation of our communities of interest fee representation of electors and the need for change to an important boundary issue in terms of the current proposal the ratios for constituents generally across the city is improved but for banks potential are definitely a lot worse and that 's really because of geography and disappears population which I 'm sure you already familiar with the numbers of residents contain a beat splinter waters lower than other Ward 's a geographic area involved is very large and the population very dispute highly dispersed this arrangement would result in the sole councillor adequately representatives of her constituents we related as important to recognize impact of this travel time on the councillors ability to work for hers or who 's her constituents complex issues as well as much just geography events furniture that this area alone contains many complex issues such as lyttelton harbour the resonance relationship with support company the peninsular ex is a very important tourism gateway for the city there are special relationships with mari with some having three married papa tofu running at ruining in the area recently we 've all discovered on the news about the coastal hazard zones and that 's that 's not going to go away and our whole ward areas affected by that and also because of the the area containing epicenter of the 22nd earthquake the impacts and our wards both our side of the hill and thanks Peninsula have been very very to the year and as I said we 've got lots of homes to rebuild still lots of issues to come out when those things happen such as arguments about retaining walls will be going on properly broken pipes that community assets so the other thing that concerns is actually the structure of representation you 're proposing for area to community boards instead of one so although we understand why that might be proposed this actually adds additional demands on to that one thanks peninsular counselor so he 'll hit to he will she will have to commit Accords 14 unlike any other counselor um the thing that 's really quite concerning as the unrep presentation this will give at council due to the proposed period of community boards around the city every other board it 's expensive pen Angeles Sumner will have three councillors sitting around their community board table and they will be able to take forward and those community board issues at the council on the other hand banks function of similar results will only will not have the support and will only have one soul counselor taking forward issues for not one but two community boards while there may be a lower population numbers and thanks peninsula some not than others we submit that the above factors greatly outweigh the rather simplistic issue of just simple for two counselor positions to roots in the bank lenders are some of the ward only not talking about increasing counselors across the whole city we strongly believe the circumstances justify to counselors for this award even if this remains so only until the next representation review we understand that the legislation allows for the some special circumstances and there is not a case of having to bump up councils all over the city we don 't think the answer is just increased community board represent representation because the issue is when it gets to council that 's when you need the voice and community board members can only do so much if there are a quiz for two councils ignored what is likely to result as a high level of dissatisfaction with the performance of the single counselor and a new counselor being elected every tune this would result in a continuous lack of understanding and knowledge of our local issues by the elected representative and an effort ibly poor decision-making now in terms of the boundary the proposed boundary for the summer side of the ward finishes at problematic for our suburb and those of red cliffs and sumner this is in terms of our community of interest the residents of Mount Pleasant feel that their community of interest interest is closely linked to that of a sister suburbs of reckless and Sumner but feel equally as strongly connected to fiat the Fermi commercial area and the residential suburb of Brookhaven the current proposal does not include the letter areas but Steve Capps now present off at the western side of pyramid bridge the theorem e commercial area has an important role for us Mount Pleasant being too large a dormitory suburb without its own village or shopping center as service by the pyramid commercial area the Syria contains a supermarket our post office banks hardware store as well as numerous cafes and other amenities for at least two decades this particular commercial area has been an pilot form part of our residents association area recognized by the council the future design and function of those areas of real interest to our residents and and its closest neighbors along with brookhaven can you imagine not including Littleton or is proposed for our suburb roading the majority of my present residents use the major arterials of fury road and humphreys drive to travel to the city for work in education these routes are vital lifelines to us and what happens to them is of great concern and interest it 's important to us that the road and cyclin corridors of fury road and humphries Drive remain within our ward area we need our counselors have influence over these issues which pertain to these key roading corridors as they affect our daily lives conversely people residing in lynnwood Ward have no real interest in these roads as they look more to the west and north not east additionally we have a special affection for the child 's birth history Charles with reserve many of our people go and tend that reserve and in look after it and she had gotten shut with brooke haven and this is demonstrated at attendance and planting days and maintenance of the reserve a mess I 've said before the residents who live in Brookhaven have strong ties with Mount Pleasant and vice versa as Brookhaven similarly many young families living when Brock cave and choose to see any children to Mount Pleasant school rather than send them west to Worcester on benford brockhaven residents are currently included in the Mount Pleasant school zone given the above reasons we believe it as logical to leave mark has appeared not somebody with recurse and some not but the Brookhaven and three men commercial area and we believe that as in power of half dies road to do acts as a very natural boundary now another couple of little things I 'm the ward name we do not support the proposed name of the Littleton summon award we are unhappy that as a suburb we 're always subsumed under the name of salmon are we 're actually the largest community on the hillside that always gets up soon done to sub know and sometimes it has um quite big impacts because during the earthquakes we didn 't actually get any any civil defense service at all if people just kept talking with some an erect of summer and we got completely immersed but that 's not likely your attention we would suggest it be more closer than descriptive of the area that the new Ward of it progresses be named the harbour Bay 's Ward rather than some littleton our community board name in terms of the community board name we submit that it should be changed to be more effective or geographical communicate communities and would suggest named Esther hills or portholes history so in summary we ask that the council reconsider the way it has dealt with the coastal bays and thanks widget area and this review as the boundaries drawn for Mount Pleasant do not put with our communities of interest the proposal one counselor for the banks filters summoner war does not provide for a feat of representation of our communities of interest and it spectacularly fails and providing for Thea representation for electors thanks very much good Andrew Thank You Linda for the submission I 'm just interested in a number of points you rate as a part of the submission is in obviously the context of the bank 's peninsular summon award as back homes and then you make some comments linwood avenue and ferry road you mentioned in particular so how am I look into the city rather than out onto the peninsula so I 'm almost taking the submission as as two different things one of which is if we were to proceed with the proposed exponential of some reward then you have some concerns about representation how it 's delivered but you 're also making some points around the community of interest that we 've identified calm and pleasant and boundaries would would I be reading correctly into what you 've said if I was to translate that into Mount Pleasant would be more appropriately paired as a community of interest with either the Boston or Linwood proposed Ward 's than the banks peninsula proposed Ward is that a correct representation of what you 're saying oh really um we don 't really have anything more to do with the Linux printer area than any other part of the city I mean it hid kit has a close relationship with a little tunnel but we don 't particularly and we really are focused where we travel and the and being under that so does anybody and I think a lot of people have got ties with austin and and elsewhere that we wouldn 't like to be severed from repulsed insight and Sumner either because we share a lot a lot of identity within yep yummy thank you one of the other issues that 's come up from some submissions as being the grouping around community boards and paper paper is concerned that longwood would go to the north and that effectively what is the Hagley ferramenta community board but it disappears and subsumed by the other boards around it so do you have any views around the ward appearance in terms of the community board constitutions I can 't_''_736.75 say that I 've spend a lot of time looking at the pyrrans um more out the net what 's affecting us um I think Linwood speared a bit oddly and I think that nice-looking it we 've always had Lee pyramids just always worked so well it 's just a shame that 's having to go but you know just only sorry just after the question in connector in terms of the community board basically from the central city to this yes plans so did you see that as an important component of a sign of a community boards yeah you could say then yeah very wrote you know if anything it 's a fury road it just clicks all those communities along that line so yeah it 's a very important part we 've had quite a long discussion this morning because of a range of submissions that obviously we read of in advance about you know the bank 's financial and whether we could take a you know a view back to the local government Commission which there is a reason for you know having a discrepancy in an isolated community argument you know it doesn 't work when you include little ton but actually it doesn 't make sense if you don 't so you know there 's there 's some work that we 're going to do on that and we 've asked staff to provide us with some options including a fallback position which might be slightly different from the one that submission this morning on the brookhaven community which we see connects towards very meat and amount please and rather than towards the city so I think that points been well made as well so it 's good yep so thank you very much okay maybe she ate it um oh you on your own smashing now only you don 't you don 't want to present this previous submission from cup of tea yes we had what do you need to come in and talk to that room and follow me come on from that some members wanted to make their own submission yeah so we did that and that was submission but that helped form the basis of our own submission right so um I don 't think there 's any real need to go through okay yeah that 's fine thank you very much the next one is the ability street _"

the social residents association which was formed in 1946 to promote the progress of south shore and to promote and protect the community and the south shore national natural and urban environment so everything that we look at is in relation to that to our community and our surroundings in looking at the representation and the changing of the boundaries and so on we 're used to the Burwood Pegasus

progression as it continues around the ester and to our mind that does create added pressures and workload on counselors and on community boards this is particularly obvious that we take in the bulk of the red zone so from the city right through to the estuary our area of Lynwood booooored coastal has most of the red zone a lot of flooding issues and is largely for certainly on the coastal point of view the part of the coastal hazards own these are areas where there would be a lot of work required over the neck five or six years with the decisions on the red zone and the way it affects us as it is at the moment and also the coastal hazards which is one of the major things that I can see Christchurch facing in the near future and while this is a whole of Christchurch situation this Ward will bear the brunt of of what comes out of this and I so by projection that will also affect our counselors and our community boards so we believe that what we actually need is an additional counselor so although we have one for suggestion is that we have one additional counselor for that combined area in the same way for the community board we increase the number of that community board by two members and our reason is you have a new area and it will cover a much broader spectrum of people probably a whole different range of issues plus your everyday workload which is common to everywhere but in additional with the red zone and the coastal hazards we can see that there will be a huge amount of work and it 's very important for groups such as ours the residents association and other groups to work with the council to provide great solutions that work for everybody and so we feel we need that extra representation and that a six year time span which is covered by this review would actually be a good time span two hours for that and then perhaps look at going back to what will be a standard representation model and that basically forms the things that we have to say on a social more social note the requirements of communities do vary considerably could be detrimental to the needs of the other and the people who shout loudest might get all the attention and the people who perhaps need assistance in different areas won 't get the attention they deserve because of the spread of what it 's going to be required in the future my final comment is that South Shore has actually disappeared and as a suburb or off the maps it 's only gives us new brightens I don 't know if we 've we 've been white intentionally or quite what the story is there that South Shore doesn 't it seem to exist in these maps that 's an individual area and we think that as we 've been around for a long time and a pretty Pacific with some and vocal residents association that we need to reappear on your Maps thank you thank you perhaps it 's what could we just ask staff to comment on that last trip because that I don 't think that the max of anything other then sort of representative of their areas of population and done on these appalling Lee know the mish blocks yeah so I don 't know that South Shores disappeared from the math that 's just not identified as a separate area motion yep probably like they have you zealand post office they don 't recognize North Beach they talk about North New Brighton and they probably don 't recognize our Shore either it 's probably just further south problem myself New Brighton yeah the official mesh blocks so that the mish blogs that would be so the absolutely south shore is not off our radar it is absolutely on our ADA but I just wanted to clarify that because we don 't want you to thank you disappeared you here thank you know we don 't like to think you disappeared and a lot of people have questioned that when they 've looked at the map and there is no sales sure yeah appearing on it yeah it 's still on the map but it 's not named yeah so I want to ask a question about because in terms of the current build Pegasus Ward and the boundary was surely papanui I think this which was that the current boundary is the Styx River but if we were to take all of the coastal environment through to the waimakariri River them we needed to extend the boundary up to the Y McCreery river to give this coastal environment and I mean is there a general sense of support for that concept yes because we believe that the coast can be looked at as a whole and so that it 's very much shared an uncommon interests so we think that the coastal burwood grouping is fine lynnwood in some respects is ok but we just do that too far run together so far into the city and you start at City problems and so then you need more people to deal with those issues its base clear no argument there so you would rather that we perhaps looked at some some components of our northern boundary and substituted for some components of the Lynwood boundary down below so that we could get something that looks a little bit more like booooored Pegasus without you know sort of disturbing going beyond we 're trapped a counselor I don 't think that we can manage to achieve that with the population numbers because its peer per head of population and although we recognize that there 's a considerable amount of work to be done in that particular area I don 't know that we can we can use that as a reason to to step outside for plus or minus ten percent does it work that way with numbers of councillors you have to be within the puzzle mode so you 're 50 another 16 counselor for to another 10 years yeah so I 'm sorry yeah you have to add another count the group of councillors to the council table in order to get an extra one for that one because what if you do it for their here you 'd have to do it for other areas of a similar size that 's the trouble the one area where we 're having some debate at the moment is whether whether we can revisit the banks peninsula which of causes a far more distant community than then the TSA 's and basing it on the quite jell with the criteria under the under the legislation but but what we 're hearing what you 're saying and it 's a general support for the velocity of grouping the coastal populations absolutely are as a community of interest in having a significant community of interest right now and certainly for the next six years and and then perhaps doing some readjustment so that you get more alignment at their southern end yes yeah yani thank you thank you for your submission um so if we can 't just add an additional counter for that coastal ward would you support us having a small award so frequently that counselor headless work so they could focus more on those local issues yes that would be would be fine so in terms of thinking clearly burwood Pegasus I think that the workload generated by that area with the additional issues particularly as I 've mentioned previously and would be a reasonable mix of work if we maintain that smaller size any other questions clean just maybe my chair there hear about another community board member or two whether that would could it work and there 's a composing community for members still subject to the plus or minus temper seen in subdivision so you can 't add an extra one you have to do it right across the bill so it 's not possible under the laws that govern this to add more people on to a community board you have to make sure that that 's what it 's classed under the fair representation so you can 't hear one suburb getting more representation than another sunset so if we ask for a breath suburb even though we had specific reasons for it for it to be agreed it would have to apply to everybody because it 's her number of people not per number of issues that to be fair in terms of the community oh yes oh not interfere with a number you see city one sub division within the community board having more than the other subdivisions with the literature no but what what they 're asking for is is that there is an additional community board member given the amount of work so that 's only that community board will take some advice on there it would yeah it is interesting given their variants that could be possible with savings Nancy low with the variance exists and I mean we 've had an unusual event so yeah it may not tell me the trouble is as the legislation 's very focused on Geographic once you decide not to have that large from you know Aleutian elections yeah anyway its food for thought and we 'll take some advice on that because we do we are sympathetic to the issues that you raised obviously because we know that the challenges in their area are significant and will be for some time unless we can see that these issues are going to be long term and very consuming yeah and so we we need to be well represented and have a really excellent relationship with our counselors and their community boards to hear and make us effective and and to make it all work that 's true and I mean there 's going to be a lot of work going on in that area I mean I get some advice as to whether you know the case could be made for an extra extra numbers of community board members and not not just necessarily one but but but maybe two or three so then that way that it 's taken care of it the community board level that you 've got a bit more representation at that level and not a lot more Minds applying themselves to the analysis that 's going to have to be done I mean there 's just hugely challenging issues the air and it 's not going to I mean n some exciting stuff to you know like the redevelopment of New Brighton under the regenerator ashish model so i mean there 's lots of exciting stuff that 's going on the future of there is little red zone and as as we move we we 're just beginning let 's get started and yeah that 's for a long way behind a lot of other parts of Christchurch but there is an enthusiasm now to actually do something and be involved and their people are differently feeling that so it 's little make it happen yep I don 't thank you very much that 's just that it 's given us good food for thought so thank you very much thank you much appreciated thank you oh now you 've got your person _"

    "text": "far away and I 'll keep that quite brief because in fact it it covers much the same thing we 're talking about the the same area and my submission is as a long-term South Shore residents like ladera just but over 20 years and so it 's a really important area and having become more involved with with the people who live there we just find that building a relationship that allows us to be represented is probably the most critical thing as people recover from the mcquay can actually start looking forward now we 've get in some roads worked out people starting to build so from my point of view that 's really important but I can just see the enormous workload and having been involved in submissions for the coastal hazards just realize how time-consuming that has been and what enormously steep learning curve and so from that point of view for my personal submission is that we again have to have the people that we can deal with and that 's really important on a social level looking at having lynnwood added to our coastal make sense we go right to an intern into the middle of the city and the the social needs of pat 's of lynnwood community is very very different and I 'm really concerned that people will not get the level of representation that people who are more able a fight in a specific battle will obviously be taking the bulk of the attention so how to use em make it that those perhaps five communities that are going to miss out and so I really feel for those communities and we need to look it away to make that fairer if you like for everybody and so that is really key point of my submission not necessary we shouldn 't have Linwood I mean it 's it does bring all the red zone into one area and I can see that has been very good when it comes to the point where we actually start working on what happens new red zone in the future that in fact one area is probably the key one that is dealing with it because they 're the people that have to live board and the counselors who represent us will have to be very strong in representing to the rest of the council and the rest of the city because quite often I think people think well I 'll the earthquakes are gone from one side of the city but for the other it hasn 't so we we 've got that divide and it 's well it 's not our problem coastal hazards are not our problem because we 're not by the beach it doesn 't really affect us ok we have issues with with the rivers and they 're not that great that 's a lot of silt sediment goodness knows what a lot of work needs to be done for whatever is done always ends up on our doorstep and fail sure literally so if there 's a leak of sewage or this flow off and industrial sites from roads and so on into the rivers it ultimately ends up on our doorstep and if we want South Shore the beach frightened as a recreation area and it 's a fantastic area a fantastic wildlife area and really that for the whole city and that people throughout the city need to know that it 's worthwhile and valuable so that 's those are really my my points that 's all I 'd like to say on that thank you yeah actually I should have said the cereal and Victoria 's and that 's to acknowledge publicly you know the the wonderful work that the social residents association have done and in helping to translate challenging issues so that they 're accessible to a community under stress so it is really appreciated and it 's um we 've got to have hard row to hoe year but we 'll get there and you know it 's what people like yourselves and residents association like the one you represent that will help us get here so thank you very much for that thank you think thank you right _"

    "text": "thank you the comments that were lost online are being circulated probably a lesson of old men shouldn 't attempt to submissions online I 'd like to commend the council for coming up with what I think is a pretty workable solution all electoral systems are a compromise between competing principles or a compromise if you like between the ideals and the practicalities and I think the council has come up with something which is pretty workable commend council for increasing the number of councillors from 13 to 16 I think that 's a sensible move in the right direction personally I prefer to see 20 it was the work blowed of councillors is huge you all know that and I would like to see the counselors have a much stronger present on the presence on the boards of directors of the various council enterprises which are multiplying and multiplying and it 's very important the council keep in touch with those boards because otherwise they contend to get off track and away from the principles on which they were first established they can too easily become just ordinary companies direction various people i notice have said that council is like a board of directors a council is not like a board of directors I 'm inclined to think the only people who say it is a people who haven 't had experience and local government and also in the boardroom they 're very very different because you represent the people in a way that company directors never have to and apart from that the work of a complex of a council is far far more complex than work even even a very very large company points on the number of warts I think it 's a great idea to increase the number of wards to 16 I think it 'll put the local back into local government the wards currently a huge do you realize the wards are the same size as parliamentary constituencies roughly speaking and we have only 60 constituencies in New Zealand and we 've got wards are almost as big as parliamentary constituencies so I think a move to something smaller would be much more workable for councillors and above all for community board members know the local secretary or the chair of the reasons Association wants to Stanford of community board to have to cope with a vast area he might be well known in a couple of suburbs but for expect him to try and become known over 15 suburbs and countered actually 16 or 17 suburbs and current build Pegasus so I think that smaller Ward 's would definitely concert '_''_180.25 achieve the what the local government act wants to do with communities of interest or as electric you 'd know I think community of interest are better served by small rewards number of community boards well ideally you 'd probably have a community board for every ward but that would not be practical it would result in huge expense waste for the staff time so I think the current proposal for seeding community boards makes a lot of sense I just have added a comment here which may be of sight the other order I think the effectiveness of community boards is adversely affected not so much by the size of the area they cover but by the under resourcing I effective I 've heard various submissions morning about representation on banks balance or etc but I think that if community boards were effectively resource for banks balance or whether it 's part of a small award or part of a bigger one I think that the community would recognize the effectiveness of community boards in responding to rural little local needs have you heaven take questions you creature maybe I 'll start off because I 'm i know that you live and obviously be with Pegasus and from your address and the South Brighton part of it do you have a view on the the idea of bringing together all of the coastal communities so that they are all in one ward so that their interest and obviously the challenges and some of the planning decisions can be brought together and two into one more I think it makes a lot of sense for protection of the local coastline especially in these days when we are thinking about a sea level rise another respects of course you brightens got a lot to do with our own OE but I think result in compromises I don 't think you can avoid the compromises because christ church is a city which we are one suburb mergers and perceptibly and to another hmm the always wondering what the dividing line is between out annoy my naughty nobody 's worked that out yet yeah I tend to call the Mariner wine only for their reason that it 's yeah hmm do people have yep and Phil thank you do you in the what 's an air document you make a comment in relation to the changes in Oscar alphas refer to this before the and when council was reduced from 24 to 12 wards and you also make the comic bit those forces in having accounts on 2004 were in typically or interpreters offers up to local governments style that may the council popular to its people so I 'm just wondering by being popular with its people do you mean they 're in fact the council the council needs to receive like the support of others residents and agreeing with the decision that 's made or what is there something else you I depends on the closeness its relationship with the people that it represents and it seemed to me that back in the 1980s we did actually achieve a very close relationship through the simultaneous establishment of community boards local service centers and small local wards I think that combination those three factors made the council very close to the people and I guess I 'd have to add the resourcing of community boards so that we could respond to local needs the the small wards i think was part of the mex think we had 12 wards 12 words of with two councillors I think some of the submissions that we 're going to be hearing though in and some of them that have we 've received that that aren 't going to be here would suggest that the the change to to centralization within the city actually cost a lot and I 'm that we 've already heard that from Oscar this morning about you know biking down colombo street as a member of the heath community the hip county council here and i think that there 's an element view that the council was more cost effective because you agglomerate on you centralized an actual fact you get a greater distance and a lot of money can be spent on administration for a larger body then perhaps would be at a at a smaller level which is what part of the reason why i support more work going to the community boards rather than centralized on the council i think there are some things that are clearly metropolitan like the water system for example there are other things that are clearly local like playgrounds and local roads and parks and what sort of thing and if that can be delegated to community boards so much the better i think that you really do get a much better sense of the need the priorities of the community when those things are delegated exactly it 's a little bit hearts of council to give away see community Danny thank you for submission um I just wanted to check with you your thoughts a number of submitters have said that we should go to a three councillors elected across award and have wards and the community border areas being the basis for election and if that was something that we went through we went to what do you think the impact would be on the lower socioeconomic areas all the areas of lower butter tuna and do you think that they would still be able to be effectively represented around the council table one of the real problems is that people who are mobile tend not to vote max Robertson who was council secretary for many years and used to run the elections a a survey after one of the elections to discover who voted and who didn 't and he found that people seldom voted until they had been in an area for five years so we 've got a high proportion of people who are renting their accommodation they come into the area new they 're less familiar with the local people and they tend not to vote they 've been in an area for a few years so that means that generally speaking the lower socio como areas where the rental population is higher tinned vote and tend to if you have large Ward 's then the the owner occupiers the tenth of the more affluent section of the population do definitely upvote the others I think that 's just a plain in fact I remember seeing the voting figures few years and go for a run hagley and fear ameed there were same number of voters in each but the number of people who voted in fira mean always outnumbered greatly the number who voted in hagley represented i think by dinner so Gourcuff remember rightly yeah who 's so well but it 's that 's exactly I mean to me that a show in 2003 wasn 't they 've been the wards together the wrong way they didn 't look for the center and put the center at the heart of the new wards they just bang them to give willy-nilly because they were next to each other and I think that was we 've inherited their problem because of the rollover that second sentence I 'm sure that that was part of it but I guess that they created very very huge rewards as well with counselors as I recall with you time so we 've had better Sheriff 's okay to the future clean as Justin just a devil 's advocate question David you know as counsel as we live in this constant tension I guess of being a city council under an award counselor not sure we always resolve it but moving to small awards do you think that would change the dynamic positively or negatively and that rich and norm I think counselors have always got the job to be conscious of the the needs of their own local constituents and to represent their views while at the same time taking a view of the needs of the city of the hall and in my view council has always managed to do that I don 't don 't recall people being excessively parochial and I 'm sure that the people here are responsible in that way so they represent their local views but nevertheless take responsible decisions example that 's a very nice note to end on but for the morning session so thank you very much honey term will now adjourn until one o 'clock _"

    "text": "Keir loosely from people Choice executive welcome kid thank you um so to start with we would like to congratulate the council and mayor envoy has been a well-run robust and transparent process we think it 's been an exemplar of how this sort of what should be done and we would also like to congratulate the council staff who have done a really amazing job at making sure that the information is out there that the process is carried oh well and which think it 's been a really strong process um overall we endorse the outline of the initial proposal as a response to the Council of regulatory requirement to provide fair and effective representation of communities of interest however we do feel that some changes would improve the proposal and would address many of the concerns that have come up so at the high of the process is providing fair and effective representation for communities of interest and the local government Commission 's guidelines or local authorities undertaking representation reviews give us their criteria in terms of achieving their which include and I think these are particularly recognized communities of interest between two electoral sub Persians and not grouping together two or more communities of interest there had few common interests so the council is not just required to avoid splitting communities there 's also required to avoid inappropriately grouping communities and we see the finding a path which balances and satisfies both these conditions as a core problem for the council and drawing up a proposal um currently is our view that the current large jewel mean by Ward to do and appropriately group communities of interest as the mayor has observed the local government Commission 's 2004 determination foreign boards by caught banging together banging two words together in a way that ignored further seems as well try Frank was a well put the latest literary framework has moved on since that determination and the council and a local government different legislative tests window putting together a proposal and so for instance is hard to see what the residents of Kashmir as our wealthy dormitory suburb on the hills have in common with Dean 's and or even suburb like Eddington but both are clumped movie single member awards as a way to remedy that problem in part we also think that the moderate increase in councillor numbers helps resolve that problem and we particularly agree with former councillor Bob shearing and his opinion that there 's a decent numbers of fair given the growing population I 'm not going to talk about specific community foundries issues because I think that there will be other people would be a place to talk about them We strongly support the council working with residents with bra issues to the table to resolve that and we have a great deal of confidence and the council to do that i will talk briefly about the community board issues because there is a major change and to a large extent this is in the inevitable consequence of the post-quake population chefs it would be very hard to maintain the current community board arrangements and fair an effective representation across a city without creating artificially complex structures so it there is inevitably going to be an element of change given that there 's been a population shift in terms of the communal members within metropolitan christchurch the loss of community board members occurs in part in the peninsula sumner area so within the metropolitan area there 's a shift from sex boards of five to five boards of sex both result in ferreting Metropolitan Community Council members and given councillor serve on boards will be more people serving on boards than before there is a shift in how those members are arranged and there can be discussion about the best way to do that it is our view that system of five boards of sex members would be acceptable there may be other solutions with six boards of however mainly which resolve issues raised by the community and we think that 's an area the community the council could explore in terms of the group ends awards to form community board areas it is important to remember that the names of the words are somewhat arbitrary the marchlands words for instance could equally well be named redwood the wolf stone Ward said in them and so while it may seem strange script Martin 's partner in central you could imagine a which are to the Queen the council does consider community for groupings attention is paid to not just the name of the ward but the center of gravity of the population because in some cases that may influence how you view of things um we would as we would like to total called the Green Party presentation in terms of using Tyrell Mallory and the names of the wards we think that would be a respectful gesture if we were able to bring in some Torrio and to our political life in that manner and I think they 're really good manner gesture I also think that particularly for the community board areas they 're giving naming them by grouping together free wharves results in slightly absurd names like marshlands papanui central that would be a particular area where that would be quite a useful tool and as has come up with a bit today the bank 's bunch of what does pose a problem there is a conflict here between on the one hand the Democratic principle of each vault being equal so every person across the city should which would push towards grain banknotes are strongly in line with the size of the woods on the other hand there is of course the problem at the bank modular is a very different community and does require a different treatment so we have concerns about the long-term sustainability of a single ward like the current bank special award which has a very large disparity with the overall council it 's the second-largest disparity in New Zealand we don 't think that 's a long-term sustainable solution however the current initial proposal we feel probably goes too far in terms of it seems like there is a great deal of community concerned about that so that 's protect Lee an issue where I think that the hearings process will be of assistance to counsel and I think that snare there 's a lot that can be done in terms of coming up a solution which balances the requirement for fairness and equality across the city with representation for those communities so thank you and if there are any questions I 'd be more than happy to take sample okay and having words combined like multi-member walls and I know you your comment is that there 's a risk that perhaps then you 'd have groups have community those communities may have few commonalities it is a wonder if you might like to expand on that issue so for instance if you look at there 's been a favor of concern and the submissions that the community board areas don 't set well together no that 's some of that can be resolved some of theirs just fundamentally part of dividing up the city and two large areas if a community board area is problematic as a community board area it would be even more problematic as a ward so I think I signs of bear in mind that if you have a community board area say record 10 holes will hornby there are people who would feel the days maybe yeah an appropriate one thing or say lynnwood boast and Kashmir or Linwood 's Kashmir spread and what are some of the examples those involve a significant clamp things of communities which are quite different and I think that would which are significantly risk from various George here significant commonalities thank you yep any other questions okay good thank you very much for your submission and for putting the effort only we do appreciate the fact that people have gone to a lot of trouble so thank you very much _"

    "text": "um adoro spray from the Iraqi Green Party good morning and welcome Joe Dakota too far no Kay Robertson and I are here today to speak to the submission from the older key province organization within the Green Party of all to you it 'll work when the older he greens reviewed the City Council proposal we came to the realization that this proposal over emphasizes the wrong principle and this lead to the wrong result overall we believe the key issues our identification of communities of interest effective representation of these communities of interest and fair representation of electors and the Treaty of Waitangi in summary our presentation today is to reinforce our fundamental assertion that communities of interests are the basis of community resilience and as these communities of interest that form the backbone of community advocacy the mere herself recently praised the community that falls within the newly proposed coastal ward as a stellar example of a community that has embraced embraced community advocacy and as such she felt confident that this community of interest is taking an active interest in planning its future our concern is the need to allocate populations towards using the plus or minus ten percent rule the hill suburbs those that live on the flats and our rural cousins are all quite different communities of interest later in this presentation k will read who discussion on an aspect of the suspect of our submission via representation is also important tenant of the Green Party STV is a better choice of electoral systems as it B satisfies the three key issues namely fair representation of the electors and more effective representation of communities of interest because STV encourages more candidates that represent minority viewpoints to run for election the individual preferences in sorry these to be system potentially offers a Victor 's more choice of candidates that represent their individual preferences in circumstances however it appears that consultation on an election method has been carried out our final comment and our submission is an acknowledgement of T to T it is encouraging to read that moldy representation will continue to be an ongoing discussion however we have noted that in the proposed naming of the wards that an ID to arco dd9 could is not utilizing any existing suburban names I will now pass over 2k to talk specifically to the representation hello okay so this is the main thing we realized okay section 19 v sub section 2 of the local electoral act 2001 describes a quote plus or minus ten percent limit rule unquote that each Ward should have roughly equal representation based on population that 's on page 9 of your booklet this rule almost certainly derives from the idea that roughly equal representation will result in fair representation however it must be recognized that that Christchurch is unlike other communities in New Zealand in two important ways first banks peninsula is lightly populated rural area joined to a densely populated urban area the only parallel I can think of in New Zealand is perhaps Queen Town Lake District which has the opposite situation a small densely populated tourist area joined to a lightly populated rural ones second the effect of the 2011 earthquake are still being felt as areas within the city recover at different rates and population continue to shift and adjust in the aftermath of this event north and west therefore we would suggest that the current proposal places too much emphasis on the plus or minus ten percent limit Christchurch is not like other cities in New Zealand and it is still in a dramatic state of flux this rule is not a legal requirement and should be de-emphasized in Christchurch case to rigidly attempt to comply with it creates ineffective and unfair representation of banks peninsula akaroa why riwa sumner red cliffs and Mount Pleasant it does this in two ways first it creates one enormous ward geographically more than double the size of the other 15 Ward 's combined 1 councillor has to represent all of that and second it creates a new community board that combines a lightly populated area banks peninsula with an urban one with urban ones Sumner through Mount Pleasant they aren 't a community of interest the Sumner areas urban and has 11,000 646 people it relates to the city whilst littleton plus a corolla y ReWalk all together has 8220 three people and 5007 271 of them are in littleton and that 's from page 11 of your satisfy the plus or minus ten percent rule if we acknowledge that christchurch banks peninsula region doesn 't fit the rule and dispense with it then i think we get a fair and simpler result namely banks peninsula Ward and community board could retain their current boundaries one councillor and four or five community board members the urban area keeps the seven community boards each board is divided in half to create 14 wards each represented by one councillor this proposal one retains the current eight community boards which was supported by the majority feedback retaining a similar number and distribution of community boards that 's on page five second it increases the number of councillors thus reducing the ratio of population to councillors which was also supported by the majority feedback three it keeps the banks peninsula ward which was supported by feedback for it creates more consistent communities of interests and arguably creates a fair representation five finally the City Council 's proposal of 16 councillors and seven community boards increases the total number of councillors but reduces the number of community board members potentially tilting the balance boards my proposal preserves strong local community voice so the only change my proposal from our original submission and I 'm sorry I just thought of this this week is that we have 15 councillors instead of 16 this would also come in handy to avoid tie votes the City Council 's initial proposal was to consider 14 16 or 19 wards so 15 was never considered from the beginning and I think it works well I think I 'm almost done one more paragraph as for the rest one point we wish to make is that philipstown and woolston are being split the way the boundaries are currently being drawn it seems to be yet another example of dividing the east and south of the city Oh they 've already suffered a lot because of the closure of their school and they are definitely communities of interest so to split them between woolston and Lynwood i think is what 's happening we would suggest that their boundaries should be reconsidered phillips down in woolston but it seems yet another example and i 'm from a power and so it divided sort of along north-south lines or long roads when in fact I think it should be divided east and west because this reflects the fact that the residential areas along the heathkit river and port hills are quite different from the residential areas which are closer to the center city and interspersed with commercial and industrial areas western Kashmir has more in common with Westmoreland that and then sprayed in barrington and likewise hun spray has more in common with sumner than woolston I 'm done thank you and I 've never been here before so please be gentle no no no no no thank you very much we 're always gentle thank you very much and thank you for going to the trouble of making a submission I 'll start with clean thank you more in it just with it last comment over the possibility of having 15 councillors the mirrors of vote as well so if you were wanting to avoid the tie prices that would bring you to 16 so 16 would work plus me cilantro I 'm proposing 15 plus the mayor would equal 16 unless you want to give me a casting votes okay well I don 't know whether it 's me it 'll be someone else Phil Andruw who you for your submission are you weird too though although that and to clarifying the change from your original submission which we had earlier but are you aware that in proposing a completely different alternative from what we went out for consultation on the different options that 15 is a new number in fact I would understand that legally as a council we can we can 't go we haven 't_''_587.85 consulted all on there ok the other thing we just want to ask you about was the suggestion about including some Maori names and for the for the wards and would you agree would you support the suggestion that in fact we have some parqueo names and English names coupled with morrie names yeah boolean we don 't really have a a morir name for the world like one Maori as well and that 's what we 've put on the paper is initially just to consider the new the ones that 's why we chose coastal because it was a new creation therefore there there was an opportunity with that particular ward to go to know to active duty and get dem to perhaps provide a name for that particular Ward Connerly queue and go thank you I 'm particularly interested in your comments around community board representation on banks peninsula two-thirds of the way down approach you talk about retaining the eight existing community boards and of course the peninsula currently has the littleton Mount Herbert community board and they occur oh my real community board so the the community board representation on peninsula is by way of two boards you then talk about a little higher up the page one counselor and a community board of five four or five members for banks peninsula so I 'm just interested to tease out whether you feel the banks peninsula would be best represented at the community board level by one community board or by the existing to I think my main concern is that is on page 10 it 's more that one councillor has to cover both of those and seems to me that 's too much for the single counselor to handle they 're gonna have all of banks peninsula and then up through Sumner and not pleasant now isn 't that the proposal so it 's adding to that counselors load that 's really what we 're concerned about that was the fundamental issue that we were trying to address was just acknowledgement of the load for debt counselor um Tim think you 're just a couple of worker you 've gotten your last paragraph here Weston Kashmir is more than common with we small and then sprayed and barrington if you turned that around the we heard from the previous speaker that barrington is a key activity and that would be the hub for all of those and so you could almost argue that they they all have more in common with Barrington rather than with each other well mr. alpers is from that area so i 'm i 'm going to yield he knows more about it an idea because they 're in the other party hannah is more common with Sumner the Muslim again some Martin 's I 'm hannspree so is it more economical or chill perfect what happens I 'll just a minutes yeah I 'm from that area and it seems to me it 's just like previous somebody mentioned tennis and straight look I was it you yeah and if you go one street south to Fisher Avenue and one street north to was it southward ism I mean the houses are double the price one two blocks over so there 's certain dividers where there 's dramatic changes and yet they 're being lumped together as if their community interest when they 're actually quite different and it seems to me that these boundaries do that again in its same way for the national elections and again what we 're just trying to draw attention to is that we value communities of interest and we think it 's important to take that into consideration when we draw those boundaries as we all do it 's really don 't know Yanni and then Jimmy thank you and thank you for taking the time to make a submission I was just bank 's minutes of this and don 't satisfy the past minus ten percent why you haven 't asked for an increased say 218 counselors so that we can keep that deviation lower but instead you 've you 've asked us to keep in a community of interest together and then decrease the number of councils for the urban area which seems kind of a contradiction because it makes it harder for us to argue to the local government Commission so I 've just kind of wondering how you got to 15 and with a on reflection if you wanted us to kick the pan unsee it support as increasing the population ratios on the other so that we can see greater strength for that argument we were trying to keep it as seven community boards in the rural in the urban area whereas you 're putting it down to six yes and then we want we like the idea of splitting them into smaller Awards so instead of it being councillors being elected at-large they 're split so that a counselor doesn 't have this big an area to come into the elections they 're going to represent that part of it is what is it papanui and Mara how both of their counselors are actually from Papua and Mara how it doesn 't really get representations might what I 've heard but it 's but historically so we like the idea of having more counselors and the wards being split instead of the wards being elected at you at large and so that 's why without understanding these things that I thought if we if we have preserve the seven wards in the urban area but have two counselors from each and each the wards divided that was the idea that make sense and I think also the part 2 was effect of acknowledging that occurred is a geographically large area and even though there are rules we thought perhaps it was important to make clear to when we put it forward that we acknowledge that debt counselor just here 's a very large load and therefore perhaps needs a different ratio so just just so I 'm clear so if we supported increasing the number of cal backspin on so as a standalone ward you 'd be supportive of that killer also you mean two councils from accidentally somebody suggest no a seaman racing 18 rewards hmm hmm possibly but yeah out one of our issues was just having the workload of that particular council if he acknowledged to spend quite a bit of kind of make appointment with notice and relevant number to the communities of interest Jimmy very quickly okay one question your particular mention the local garment in action STV the system much no no that 's out of order because it is not no no because we can 't we can 't review the decision we already made to leave it as long as all why they just wanted to table there is and and perfectly understandable anything very much so now we 'll move on to _"

    "text": "78 written on it but I don 't know it 's not it 's just got 78 written as a number of the submission sorry anyway page 30 of the agenda very good thank you I I think I should kick off by saying that I was the clot he made the submission to the local government Commission price and the two tails and bunnies was it 2005 2003 well 2004 I think it was implemented in 2003 was when you would have been making the submission yep and I just came I think I was lucky to come in as a sort of crucial point of their the local government Commission 's considerations with this bright idea of 12 councillors and I you know the I made that submission from a background of a Council of 24 plus kamiya and the council chambers were crawling with councillors looking to be fully occupied and hang around people with offices and and and it was it was blindly obvious to me that time that 's a council needed did not need to be that of that size and and I thought council and I strongly in a wanted to move water governance and was to was to deliver a sharp shock and that was to cut of math and and so I can blame you you can and and and sadly I was wrong I hadn 't reckoned on the management styles pleasley McTurk and am I certainly hadn 't reckoned on the series of earthquakes at Christchurch suffered but then I made that submission and the knowledge that I stood no chance of reelection enough to 12 count to the council you weren 't the only one in each league so that there were other councillors who made the submission against the council 's recommendation which at the time was 16 which is an interesting number given where we 've got to this time so please don 't please don 't make a copper anymore far away well the glove oh I know who one of them works I looked closely at the of what you 've produced them I think that you 've actually got it basically right and the only thing that I the only things that I and the election of councillors 11 p award and i 've suggested that you will end up or council of 16 former broadcasting personalities and sporting personalities and and while I have nothing against they 've only got one well I have nothing against them as such and I shall say form of broadcasting personality amongst one of my closest friends it 's not a balance council and I do think that communities collecting three councillors gives a good chance of balance on the council the in relation to boundaries i just want to remind you that rivers and railway lines make very good boundaries between communities they they do divided communities but they 're good because no one has frontages to them you know in the sense of having addresses on on rivers of railway lines banks peninsula I recognized as a separate community I had enough former role as chairman of the heath get county council a lot to do with banks peninsula we had a joint electricity authority we supplied water to littleton and diamondharbour from Heath cut and in that context I became well aware of very very different but I think in the current climate having to community boards on banks for non genres and indulgence and while well I can see that there is a difference between the lyttelton harbour basin on the aircar are based on the the difference between halls will hornby and racket and as such that you know I can see very strong differences in our the net proposed community not that i actually think that makes a very good community but the differences that they can see on Beck 's furniture between the lyttelton harbour basin and the air corral basin are small in comparison with the differences that would exist within any of the city wards so those are really the points that I wish to emphasize and I 'm happy to answer any questions could I start with the suggestion that we 're small and want to shift to Kashmir when we 've had a submission this morning that they are perfectly happy to stay with Falls or is that just based on what it looks like 40 or is there a view that you 've had well it 's a personal solution I 'm not making it on behalf of the Westmoreland community but the I just don 't I 'm aware of these the submission having been made in the past by by the western wall in the community but I just can 't see the connection with hall full and tuan be and where did they go to shop barrington barrington which is next in kashmir island no yeah some of the ones I 've talked to that of course wall so anyway but Tim in the infill yeah Thank You Oscar um I guess following on with regard to the Barrington shopping here you bring a character the area but not in the cache memory but it does service those areas right around that if you drew a line so it 's not just Kashmir but I guess looking at say the beacon of shops we mentioned there perhaps that should be in that the Kashmiri RIA there right on the edge with regards to the Strickland Street innocence street etc but again no shops also look after a circular area so whether because they do serve us more than one community Wyoming your thoughts well it 's just that they may well service the area but if the outside the reach of the elected representatives for the area that provides most of their customers that doesn 't seem right to me thank you no thank you ask oh um I just want to ask you about your point about addicting three councillors her community or across wards and like you 'll be aware that when we had the pre consultation the earlier the earlier discussion with people they were really cared that they want to do closer contact with their local counselor so and I guess that 's based on the premise that people were best served by representatives close to the community so I 'm just really wondering how in fact if we have three councillors peer sort of community across walls how in fact that isn 't going to lead to voting it large yeah well have been having spent more more of my years as a community board member than as a counselor I my response to that people after their local interests and and counselors need to rise above those local interests and think about the interests of the city as a whole well being mindful of the interests of their local community but I I 've progressed from a a stage in the his get county culture where people people would bring me up really and call me by my first name Oscar do you know that was something that thing 's doing and I didn 't know them really but they knew me as the guy who wrote us back down colombo strengthened and i was the local councillor and it was very very local I never achieved that sort of level of intimacy on our community board let alone as a counselor and 1989 when amalgamated procured the phone just about stopped and having it 's a pity that community boards haven 't achieved a greater level of connection of the communities that they represent is that there is a lot to be said so for community which sees their their elected representatives as approachable ones and but anyway ya know I think that 's we shall move _"

    "text": "not quite sure where to start and where the finish so well you 'll tell me when to finish I put a great deal of thought and effort into preparing this commentary and I chose to play with us it 's straight about as possible and it seemed to me that I could assist you all most hopefully by looking at the factors that you were obliged to take into account from the local government Commission determination by the law as its interpreted by the guidelines and lay those factors out as questions and post them of the proposal that you 've come up with so I advocate not for 14 or 16 or 419 that 's not the role I see in this piece of work it 's to see how each of those would deliver on the questions that you are required to take account of so the questions arise as you know from the determination that requires you to consider a citywide arrangement was a particular point of me in the determination to consider the strength of commonality between the communion community boards out on the peninsula now because the Commission said that that is not an enduring solution now why they said that who knows and whether it might be contested again by you that would be your decision I 'd make the observation however that between the time of the determination and now that the local electric was amended to include a further reason why a council might hold a community with lower representation so the criteria on which the local government position made that determination has changed and you now have a further reason should you choose to use it for leaving banks peninsula or some other part of the city with a variation from the plus or minus ten percent rule and that new reason that 's emerged is that if by striving to achieve a cup a a number in the ward closer to the ten percent variation that if that required you to put together communities with little commonality then you could decide not to UM the local electric act and the guidelines that fall from it gives strong guidance to you on the importance of communities of interests and defining your work and and clearly the word that the staff did with the subcommittee did that very well there 's not no question that that was the foundation of your work and that 's a huge ticket and a something that you should all feel pleased and proud about particularly the staff the effect of representation is is the tuffy and it 's hard in every respect because you 've got a balance communities of interest what what is a boundary to a community when you have to combine communities as it inevitably is the case what are the factors of commonality that you can lean on to take that decision and then the third one fair representation that 's the numbers game that I 've already mentioned the variation for as possible so based on those factors i drew 14 questions and they 're in the report and summarized in the executive summary for easy reference and so the first one do the proposals reflect the direction given through pre consultation well the answer i conclude is yes willow perhaps when the final cuts were made to to get may have been lost did the review process in it results represent a comprehensive review of citywide arrangements this was a director from the local government Commission and the answer is a resounding yes at the strengths of commonality between lint or mouth community and the corral where rewrote community examined the answers yes are the communities of interest given prominence in the proposed boundaries and were they addressed early in the process as I 've mentioned earlier that started off yes but may have been lost a little when the hard decisions have to be taken about the numbers have changes in communities of interest over time being acknowledged and reflected in the proposal um yes or no and I think that 's that 's probably a tick for you it 's it 's not easy to do the wall we faced quite a number of changes post-earthquake obviously you 've decided to put the all the red areas on the margins of the red zone in a single ward so that 's recognizing a commonality of interest equally you could have used the red zone as a boundary been some changes in relationships between suburbs that emerged I gave one of illustration of the heath get in a little town community came much closer together following the earthquakes Littleton lost its pub pubs and hiscott it may seem trivial but they lost their dairy it meant that they were faced with a 15 to 20 minute drive and get the milk in the bread and that reestablished has been reached tificate hasn 't got a dairy back so it still tends to use the port that the port of course was quickly to get its pubs back as you 'd imagine what priority um to the proposed water and community boundaries create barriers to participation this is a critical element in the local liquor act and the guidance and and this is the first one of several from here on in where the bank 's proposed banks been some award is quite problematic its mass it 's going to be very difficult for councillor working that ward it 's going to be quite hard for some of the people in the different distal parts of the community to split communities of interest there are many small splits there are quite a number in the 16 war proposal there 's quite a number in the 14 ward proposal contrary to an earlier submission there are fewer in the nineteen Ward proposal and the logic of that is just that the more Awards you have the more chances you have of being able to circumscribe a smaller community so the 19 will always win out on communities of interest the I 've addressed in particular two of the major chair sorry three of the major splits and the 16 that 's on the Wolfson area with us in the arrow nui area but there are a number of other small slits in I can answer those particular questions of people are unaware of them but I 'll leave that to a question time all of them I believe can be rectified with small changes at the margins of the of the proposed wards and I 'm happy to continue to work with staff with council seeks that to help them with that do the proposed boundaries comply with the plus and they do but some are pretty close to the upper limit and if these census day population data and it 's possible as a result of post census chain relation movement that they might be close close to or over the top I don 't think the local government Commission will hold you to ransom on that that they are on record of charring one council gently for not taking sufficient account of the post census numbers and I believe staffer on top of that we 're communities of interest to combined are they similar in character and the answers pretty well yes except we 've got the banks peninsula some problem starting to emerge again I 've observed here that in reflecting on the direction from the local government Commission to termination around the two to look at the bank 's financial award that that we may we you may have missed the opportunity of looking for some intermediate position between the very large extent to which that population is under quota to now trying to find a solution where it is exactly in quota there may be government Commission 's concern and may better help you with fear and effective representation have you got an idea of what that could look like um because I mean we had a discussion beforehand demand which was on a public session but looking at the relationship between heath cut for example in loyalty if this gets well it 's a problem yeah there 's no doubt it 's a problem and you leave the advice you 're giving is that we could actually consider the option of leaving akaroa leaving banks mana thanks peninsula as a as a separate warden its own right and then redoing the numbers across the city i 'm suggesting that you should lower there might be a little ground look out that closely yeah okay so that the you would look more at their then look for a middle ground maybe a middle ground for a fallback position well if i 'll leave the recommendation on the table that you are staff to prepare a set of maps in which the bank 's financial award as it is currently is married with part with summer whether whether that brings you to a variation from the ten percent that is not as excessive as the present one is okay thank you yeah i think that that 's that 's arguable yeah i think that we I mean with you weren 't here when we had the discussion so the discussions that have went along the lines of have we in fact taken a a view on the direction or the the guidance from the local government Commission 's previous decision to literally and in a post disaster environment with many changes yet to come perhaps that is something that we need to review and we 're getting advice from our advisor that that 's something that we could legitimately do good guys I think that would be very effective thank you um to the ward arrangements avoid barriers to participation and they do with one again with the exception of banks peninsula sumner it 's it 's going to be very hard for some of those communities to participate in Ward based activities with their counselor or with with their fellow citizens are the wards small vice versa I would hate to have the travel to be driving if I was the counselor for banks peninsula summer that spend all their time driving to the community boards arrangements group communities of similar character yes for the most part but I it 's it 's hard to argue on the basis of common interests and commonality that the Walston Ward and the Kashmir award for instance be in the same community board it 's it 's it 's not a very good match to the community board arrangements enable access by constituents to their elected representatives the answers yes has the exception to the ten percent been considered for banks peninsula and arguments being put forward against us well we 're just canvas Tatum in response to your questions and comments met Amir so i 'll leave my summary is Grievous it is with that and happily answer questions around the general points or some specifics around the that communities should really unique we just take time though so I 'm some design I think I had 25 minutes I had a larger block of time I start the club right then oh okay all right so we won 't stop for a morning tea breaking um fellow thanks Martin one of the comments you 've made around communities of interest being given sufficient province I think you made communes that although that was a focus of the pre consultation part that in fact when we as a council had discussed there he hadn 't perhaps considered that sufficiently as a priority is there a way now like for example looking at the boundaries of the maps that in fact you think that as a council we can in fact address that so that we do give it more prominence if I conveyed that impression I was a little harsh I was suggesting that perhaps when the staff tried to sort of square the circle around the numbers then that had to take a sick lower priority rather than saying you as councillors so it didn 't take it but an answer to your question yes it is possible I think there are marginal adjustments that can be made to to improve the community of interest situation a quick question since you 're here what do you think of the anomaly that the general electorate wards are different to the local election wards and is this an opportunity to match those up or does it does that not make sense um well it it 's not necessary or not and are normally that they don 't follow it the the electoral when you 're setting general electric boundaries you are required to reflect on the local body of boundaries but there 's no reciprocal requirement on the local body boundary setting to take account of general electorate boundaries because well because there was one submission here where somebody was saying for the general election there in Wigram and for the local body there in films for my merit in certain terms of their focus around representation gets split and they 've suggested actually people can tune out a little bit when they 've got to consider two different communities that they 're supposed to be in around representation if the P and remain p the the general elective boundaries are very general electorate areas are very large over the place from here I think it 's inevitable and and it 's not something you can easily resolve Pauline it just just clarification one of the problems we have our challenges is the biggest moocher one so we 've talked about by the retaining the status quo or changing what the proposal is that goes into it do you have an opinion about retaining status quo is a preference or is it too early to say I 've tried to stay away from having a personal preference I 've tried to sit down the criteria that the fact is that you 're obliged to take into account by law and both by the determination that gives you direction on those bases then it 's very hard to argue that the bank 's financial award that includes this large area across the hill and mount pheasant is is a good ward it 's very big it 's got lots of communities with different character and and it 's going to be very hard to service from a representative the point of view so it doesn 't meet the criteria out for consultation on it because what it 's done is it 's parked off on a incredibly strong response not on both sides of the help me so and I think that 's incredibly helpful for us in terms of making a decision but what I 've taken from your submission which hasn 't given me some never kind of comfort is that we could actually make an adjustment we could propose the status quo we could propose a fallback position as well which might be slightly different from the one that we 've put out for consultation and we would be within the the framework of the questions that you 've asked us to consider and I think that 's very helpful Andrew you 've obviously done Martin a lot of work putting this report together and it 's certainly provoked some some interesting discussion and I 'm sure it 'll continue to do so given the challenges in front of us we 're going to hear what we 're going to hear over the next few days and then obviously there 'll be some some devotees I former councillor shearing as well but I you and Bob shearing available to assist staff with further technical information if required based on the amount of research and workers gone into the two papers I certainly can and I think it would be appropriate if councillors sharing jointly as it were not necessarily at the same time in the same room but but also offered his advice and experience if that was helpful yep all right thank you very much _"

    "text": "familiar this Brian coming as well he 's had to go to Melbourne for our close family funeral oh so it 's unexpected so my apologies and I want to cuz I only hope us on myself a theory I only hope to hear in to technical support but it 's me at present I do have a met and I 'm just wondering if I could give that just to hand around quietly I 'll come to in fact there at the end yep first of all I want to say at the outset that the review process this year has been inclusive considered and involved public participation so it 's been excellent and I want the staff I think the staff have acted very well for you in this this is a marked contrast to what independence citizens experienced in 2003 we we felt excluded and appealed to the local government Commission and the council ruling at that point was over tuned so we 're very keen that we don 't go down that process again it doesn 't do any of us any good that doesn 't december 2014 saying that we wanted to work in a collaborative way so we are hoping that we can come up with something which everybody 's reasonably comfortable with now we 've got two recommendations and two suggestions for boundary change our first recommendation is probably left field but we 're recommending that you defer the rippers tation review so council can focus on your main business which is Beth quake recovery we 've listed the six or seven issues that councils facing in the next year and I 'm sure you can all add more in fact than that the representation review and our opinion as an unnecessary distraction but we recognize if you were to consider deferral you would also have to get approval from the minister of earthquake wait recovery so we 're putting this up as a possibility but you 'll have a better sense as to whether the minister would approve it then in fact I have on the second recommendation I just want to give a preamble our association was very supportive of the 14 ward model it links to current boundaries at avoid Walston lynnwood if you use the 14 model that is avoided an end and our view the 14 model is the best model for council to function effectively and efficiently so we have a very strong view on that now we understand that the 40 model was rejected at the last council vote on this 86 so I 'm going to touch on recommendation to which accepts we 're probably going to have to live with the 16 model so our preferences 14 but if we 're going to live with 16 we have a recommendation we support the sexting sexting model for community board members but suggest councillors are elected across the community board area so for example Pendleton here word McLain 's you would have each board member in that particular ward flat phenol turn or here would only flames but the counselors would be elected across that large area and our viewers that counselors have both a representative and governance role and they have a stronger governance role than board members three councillors across award would lead to better governance as councillor counselors would gain a perspective Ward is that each counselor gets intimately involved in his or her area that will lack that broader perspective in our view it places counselors in a representation role rather than a governance role in good governance is critical for the city as it faces a number of large challenges unknown to any other council in new zealand and obviously talking about the earthquake quite recovery issues hours boss touching on council workload i 'll leave leave that alone so those are the two main recommendations one it 's deferral to that if you go with the 16 model you look at three councillors across that broader area leaving banks peninsula and sumner with their one councillor so it 's using the model but a slight adaptation for counselors now we I do have three possible boundary changes and the first one I 'll touch on is Fendall tune which is in in front of you they consume is that the mere avail area is split in two by going along pepper new erode so the suggestion is that it goes the line goes up rutland street but you could a drive around there myself yesterday certainly if you took bristol street as a line it looks like the houses a very congruent with the other side of pepper new erode so would ask you to look at that in terms of if you were to accept that argument then there 's been an offering up in the kondal avenue area of an area that could go to in fact kept annoying so we 're saying look at that northern side of me revolt as findell term and then and compensation you could look at that area and between chondral avenue and pepper new erode as pepper nuit so that 's our first suggestion the second one is on riccarton and this is an internal boundary between Rickett and hornby if you 're happy with us i haven 't had the maps done I 'd like to leave that to tomorrow where I making a personal presentation but it has been endorsed by the group the third one relates to Westmoreland and that has come out from reading submissions there 's a number of suggestions that we 're small and Peter Rollo Lee who 's the representative for miss Morland has discussed it with them they are comfortable where they are and I 've attended a number of meetings public meetings led by the staff on us and the west mall and residents are very comfortable and staying within the Riccarton hornby hallsville ward and they have been there since I 've been elected across the large award in 2004 and they 've been there in the Wigram ward as far as I understand since nineteen eighty nine so we feel very strongly that they remain as you have them in that ward and not move across to to kashmir and from my understanding of their association they are very strongly supportive of this this proposal rather than the shift so that 's really all I have met and mere and perhaps if I could just kick off them on that first one don 't you think that using Rutland street and condola would infect split communities of interest quite significantly well this has come from I mean I personally it up neither sister I think we 're looking at bristol street as well as the possibility we haven 't got the mesh block figures done right so I 'm sorry we 've just gotta met in a proposal but but you 're what you 're trying to do is you 're trying to you trying to get me Ravel together that 's right is um but it 's it 's on two sides of a natural boundary and it 's a boundary for electoral purposes for the electorate 's or split down Papa no Road as I recall has that changed I 'm sorry I don 't know you know Jamie might know yeah um anyway I 'm I think there 's a challenge with taking such a strong natural boundary as Pablo road and trying to shift it for a specific purpose i understand you know Mirabeau as a scene is a nothing i 'm ryan actually used to be called sin albans in my day name is it carries hey did you mean is it currently split from this yes currently splits yeah but it 's i thought it was xsplit for electoral purposes for a central the island Ward and the suggest is a strength and and crush it central yeah Andrew and then Paul was that thank you to question Jimmy can and the first one I just wanted to drill down into your support for the 14 model of little further particularly is that related ancillary we 're grouping communities of interest communities where there 's commonality the 14 model saw the banks peninsula ward spread right across the way the top of the port hills we 've got a number of submissions saying the banks peninsula Ward as put forward in the 16 model is too big and groups communities of no interest or little interest how could you support the 14 model as it relates to banks peninsula I 'm just interested in how you would how you deal with that issue is we probably hadn 't looked at that carefully again and it 's it was only an i don 't think the 14 model is going to fly at this point but it was just our strong view that it was the preferred model but we 're looking more at mean I 've got a very personal view and Mary 's heard me on us that banks peninsula should have been separate and I was making at the working party on this that a met was drawn up and then I think it went to counsel who he said no no will hey but I 'm only this is very personal view of mine it 's not the Association speak alright thank you and then just a point of clarification on the submission if we refer to a page nine our agenda the third paragraph down and there 's a discussion about the balance of the governance role of a counselor and the representative road and I totally agree that getting that balance right is important I agree with the statement you made around community boards been been closer to the communities than the counselor but thats and third paragraph there starts the disadvantage of having one counselor Ward is that each counselor would become intimately involved with his owner his or her own area I just wanted to check that I 'd read that right because I would see it was well balanced yes I mean it it it can be in vantage but it but the disadvantage job is that you get stuck in record in France survivor is you get very tangled up with the reggaeton issues they sort of elect you and so anything happening in hornby might you might not have that broad view across the ward I have worked on that single i was elected on a small on record on and in 2004 it joined to reggaeton Wigram so I 've worked under under boat it I 'm Paul and then Jimmy it is just a wrapper boundary issue again end and the miracle max on here am i understanding and you might get a treatment for more wine standing Mirabelle finished it at Pebble rewrote not if she crossed bodrum tests and all those okie and on I don 't know Jamie can answer that but this doesn 't matter beams of you 're buying or selling that 's exactly my point i think is really around I mean in real estate industry is promoted advanced mirabar better than actual fact the do things I 've always seen a mirror bowel and I 've always seen a kind of housing which is linked to wasn 't back Maribel and I having a drive around everywhere yesterday that a Bristol straight line if you 're looking at there cuz the line does have a similar housing to the other side of back Peppa new road it 's older housing character housing and some new housing but it 's certainly got a similarity but the idea is that that mirror veils are kind of community actually may I make a comment that because I i if I may I do understand why because it was velvet FL Carter that brought this up and the reason why they proposed the boundary change more to go with Rutland to stay in the phenyl turns own and in the Conrad eerie route is that fin y mari is actually probably quite low in community groups as a whole compared to some a number of other Ward 's but one that 's very strong probably our strongest one has likes of the Mirabelle corner very vocal and very up whereas up further north the area that they 're looking at the trade-off is the I think they called the pepper nuit RSA and they the association 's view was that there was more appropriate to include that in like the chili pepper newly area because it 's a sucky activity area for that particular part and was less of a natural fit than what the mirror Valley area was yeah i 'm just saying that Conda lever Center I mean Edison to natural boundary so but but these are the challenges that we need to take on board Jimmy thank you one question the hidden first your the city thunder independent Citizens the view regarding the boundary adjustment you attica mention you know would like to seek to the waster are from covering the church corner area to other English street the to the ender to earth the joint to add the main thoughts work if they kind assessment then the licked endure the population know is more than 22,000 people then to make the home be popular we going of reduced to love you know the standard rectum week when current victim week when the world including the victor home being host will so whether why you are not a consider mutual inference if sifter to the ingress to parse your point of view the current leader we can skype and also a Bhatia the other is a Bhatia is the area actually is more a kind of community interest to the women of whom the area heart is your opponent cancel to dice it up mentioned that in fact tomorrow yes still I mean I just have swept over some yeah broad recommendations on the record and 1 i 've got some time and think tomorrow and I want to get our met Mets and figures oh yeah thank you great look thank you very much and appreciate the trouble that you 've gone to but do pass on our regards to Brian thank you thank you Mark _"

    "text": "good morning thank you thank you I know you 're all excited to see each other over a lot after a long weekend just to let you know that the glitch that we had with the live streaming of meeting today has been resolved and so we are now able to live stream the meeting which is very useful for those people who can 't be here with us but also are very useful for us to reflect on the presentations that we 're going to receive so this is the the submissions are part of the representation review for the 2016 local authority election initial proposal and we are established as a hearings panel and we will commence the submissions today with James Cagle and if you 'd like to come forward one component of our system that has broken down quite significantly as you can tell by the microphones in front of you is the sound system so if you could speak clearly into the microphone that would be very useful for us thank you thank you thank you very much for the opportunity to present the my to consider today relatively short and simple I want to start by saying that I I really congratulate the work that the council has done so far today I thoroughly support the single member 16 councillor model that has been put forward I think it is a fundamental principle of local government and local democracy that people are served the people in the communities are served by representatives who are close to them I think this is the easiest and best way of achieving that so whatever else I have to date the say today in terms of comments or changes that I wish to put forward would it be very clear I support this model over any other that said I really only have two operations that I wish to propose to the panel and they are in the service of trying to avoid community servants which is one of the fundamental prints that you have to work for you so really they deal with I guess if you want to think of a single Ward they deal with the boundaries of the papanui wood or more clearly they relates to sintra ward and then they deal with the northern boundary of the pub- award as it relates to the Martians would so if I start with the boundary between pompano en central and Central Ward for councillors reference currently sets the fire into the room on the map can i think i have found abnormal wood which sits behind a deer yes right the idea excellent okay so first of all the current boundaries that are proposed between the Papua New Year award and the Central Ward as it relates to the north western end of the Central Ward that 's running down papi nore Road currently serve as the community of settlements the proposed boundary runs straight down saddlemen streak effectively all the way through to cranford street let 's commuter I 'm intimately familiar with I grew up there I 've lived many years in and around that community and it does sever said Albans and and it frankly mrs. the opportunity to set a fast stronger boundary down an arterial road lacking other geographical features an urban environment arterial roads a former both usually a propose simply moving that boundary further north up to finis road so the new boundary would have to run further down papua new road down on this road to cranford strengthen in back down cranford street to join with with the existing proposed boundaries that would enable much more of the catchment force in almonds primary to fool with in the Central Ward it would enable the Christ Catholic someone 's Catholic school plus the parish to fall properly within the central boundary and the local parks to fall within that boundary there is certainly some community crossover across in us road but it is much less than you see along cinnamon street at the moment you would leave the doctor surgery on one side of the boundary and the pharmacy on the other side of the boundary by way of example it 's a relatively easy change it by my accounting moves 1,700 people into the pub new award sorry under the Central Ward from the papanui ward but central is significantly at the low end of the tolerance so there is room to accommodate that move having done there is a much larger I think aberration and the boundary proposed for the pub when we would and is very difficult to see on the map behind idea just because it is difficult at long range to spot the roads that are outside a boundary but a deer if you can identify you to drive yeah the area that 's at south of qe2 drive but outside of this existing boundary back to this existing wood ought in my view sit within the bubbler water fundamentally you are severing the community of motor home including separating from the larger residential population of Idaho my toe high which currently sits in the Martians ward completely cut off from most of the residents the motions would buy that state highway you have an opportunity to send a strong word boundary on the state highway thus allowing might help to be a continuous community and in really leaving motions where it 's natural boundary or till I which is the state highway yes there are a couple of opportunities to cross the state Jairo for pedestrians and cyclists but that literally is of the state highway to be part of a community north of the state highway and the urban development and growth that 's that 's planned for the infrastructure that 's proposed is only going to continue and exacerbate that severance rather than rather than alleviate it so right now is the right time to set a strong boundary for the papanui award it would therefore if you take the two moves in conjunction stepping the southern boundary north slightly up to ennis road no no the other boundary idea down on the bottom where you 've got the kink yep there yep if you step that north of it but also step the northern boundary north of it you will you will end up with a much stronger forgive me for the work the way you will end up with a much stronger polygon if you only do one of those changes you 'll end up with a dumbbell of award really two committees the community of community of Shirley on the eastern side and the community of papanui on the other side so you really do I think one large supported ward so you would take qe2 drive right down to marsh and road correct yeah yep yep straight straight on from where if that 's exactly it straight down yep and that is rather magically and I had no intention of arriving at us it is a basically again 1700 voters so it means if you take both moves together you change the overall population of Papa no reward by a couple of hundred people no more so it really doesn 't have an impact on the on the quota for the no reward really what you 're doing is transferring 1,700 from marshlands all the way through the central marshlands I understand sets at the top end of the quota so there 's absolutely room to accommodate that change and as I said earlier there is room to accommodate the extra 1700 people within the central so you end up with no real impact on quota but to stronger communities as a result and those are my only comments thank you um do we have questions Paul eggs are good see you declare of causing when to ennis yes and you go across to cranford yes any down here further or down to down to where the existing boundary is so I have to sort of a straight is this thank you yeah Westminster streets in all the street oh yeah no I 'll net on the cranford street side it 's it 's it 's that 's we sponsor yep yep that line yep um Ellie thank you perchance I just wanted to uh no we 're not using it are we um I just have it when you talked about the single counselor model yeah what cha bc is a part of this as well and you support that entirely is that in any way dependent on the number of people that counselor is representing the geographical area because I understand what you 're saying but surely there are some parts of that model that will make a difference on how that representation can be so effective I think you 've got you 've got a number of principles and tension and so what you 're really trying to do is find a balance the Environment Canterbury proposed model where you 've got the government proposing for representatives for urban Christchurch with no ward boundaries at all and i think the principle of operation near as communities of interest I don 't think there really is a different community of interest for eastern christchurch vs western christchurch for regional council activities I think you 've got very strong arguments within a true local within within a council sense for different communities of interest between a little different the different urban villages around christchurch so i think one you want to have single members located as closely as you can to those communities so small Ward 's single representation then you 're trying to balance effectiveness of governance so you don 't want an enormous council you don 't want to counsel a 50 for example you would be able to operate so you 're trying to balance things having said that no I think you would strongly advise not to try and come up with a mix of models where you 've got single web Senate 's in one place and double representatives and to balance it within a within a model that means all councillors are equal you know they 're not there within the tolerance representing the same number of people so the big change that occurs there obviously is the size of all of the things I think you can you have to cope with I think that 's one you can cope with as opposed to having one counselor representing twice as many people but having to share that with another counselor versus one who has sole discretion and their particular place since we 've got about 20 seconds to go just your thoughts on representation that 's not Geographic we 've had a lot of young people say to us we don 't we can 't get elected an award how about you have some at-large positions that we could run for I don 't support it loads of positions other than the mural tea yeah because i think the mirror rightly represents the whole of the city i think as you age and I 'm sorry does tomato sauce American yes I don 't know as I age I think you you understand increasingly as a ratepayer as a homeowner but the pure functions of council which are related to geography and location yes there are citywide issues and yes the desert voice through that i 'd say get involved in local community and angularly come on a complexity though decision-making complexity requiring a range of people sitting around a table and we don 't want the table looking too much like itself palm island style you know but but I say that out loud that they go but I i think i 'd have to look at the data properly but i don 't think we have a problem of getting young people elected to community boards right really and I think that really ought to tell you the answer there isn 't a problem good well thank you very much and a great way to start so thank you fantastic thank you could we now _"

    "text": "opec april next year so that 'll be the last one and the new kitten okay thank you very much indeed I closed 27 the provincial council chambers and the old municipal chambers so see you Dave all right Ellis def course okay do you want to say anything the reports incredibly simple and logical sure easy to follow and injuries go to move it and Jamie 's going to seeking it I wouldn 't say no to that did you want to say anything you 're very welcome to I know it 's he just answer questions if required right okay so Dave and then Yanni do we actually have a projected budget for the repair of the provincial chambers provincial chambers the national budget 100 million dollars was muted some time ago and we 've only just fired the new LTP being able to investigate that work further we 've only just started to get into that work I am whilst 100 million is an awful lot of money these the money that 's been allocated the LTP will allow us to investigate that so we can get difficult to budget for because you don 't often know what you 've got until you uncover it so with this piece of work that we 're doing right now which hasn 't been finished we 'll have a better indication of cost and it will be coming to the council with contingencies allocated to ensure that we shouldn 't we 've got a good handle what we 're doing and we 've got don 't come back asking for more money but the money it 's an LTP which we suggestion by this paper is 30 million rather than forty four provincial chambers that 30 million will repair a substantial section of that facility and safeguard that and the building is pretty well protected at the moment at the far end and the 30 million options should be able to give us by sometime and get his corner of the building I think there 's a couple of things that we could think about the corner this proposal will do the wooden part which is while maybe not the most particular is the most historic it 's the oldest 's deteriorating and the risks will be put in a hole tonight we 've got a five-step program but some of those we may be able to find partners to help us for example the stone that the stone park closest to the Town Hall used to be run as a bar and a cafe and whatever there may be an opportunity to do that one of the things as we develop the business plan is also to look at what is the long-term use of those buildings because they 're going to survive a lot better if they 're living buildings rather than buildings that we only open on a Sunday afternoon and let people through so I think we 've got to try and get some use out of those buildings that is in kind of flavor with the with the building themselves so I think while there 's some big money involved there 's also potential to find some other partners and it 's also not only our history there its history of other organizations both locally and regionally and nationally okay jaani thank you two questions to fundraise have they been put into some sort of process to raise external funding we haven 't started that we 're obviously got as we 've put up to you in the last we 've got our philanthropic funding to look at some issues around the library to try and do that we 've got a strategy but basically as that strategy moves forward that foundation should cover all range of council projects and so there will be the opportunity there will be people out there that would want to or may want to specifically put money towards heritage and these would be to ideal candidate so I agree but at this point we are just trying to hold them and as we have said in the paper we believe we 've got a matter that we need to address reasonably urgently with our city and that 's really the background of this paper in the first instance and then sick and Christian was the the stone towers is one of the area 's it 's been addressed as David mentioned before would stage one we have had some two and a half million dollars earthquake appeal trust money so there is a start on there but it is a bigger piece and there 's a larger philanthropic element to look at when you look at across the council but there is already money allocated to that 's one of the reasons that we suggestion that the stage one is staged want to ensure that one is safeguarded so how soon can we get the wooden section of the building opened the provincial chambers and used in whether it 's council using it instead of paying private landlords or someone else but I the idea is early next year we 're going to come back to the council and explain the next steps and how we move forward with this inclusive of some early business case work for potential users with uses which you 'll actually safeguard the building as David 's already mentioned so early next year we 'll come back with some better deadlines okay thank you other any more questions you 're a trip so what 's a sorry this has been answered before what 's before yeah I am we so the provincial chambers is been muted at one hundred million dollars now it 's a substantial amount of money the 30 million dollars that were allocated by this paper if the paper gets agreed will ensure that we won safeguard the corner and to have a much better handle on the four other subsequent stages of that facility the as soon as you open up these sort of heritage buildings you come across all kinds of problems so whilst a hundred million dollars is not quite a finger in there cuz we have got it from consultants they haven 't had the time or resource spent on it to give us any sort of clarity on that number when I come back in the new year will have a much better handle on that because without turning everything over and understanding all the reports and pulling all that information together it still remains to bully for me and I ought to be able to come back with a better on it it still will have a significant contingency on it because these buildings are as an example and support to the main contractors then we took some learnings from that and it inevitably a difficult facility to pinpoint the cost on and what 's the cost of both of them together well we 've suggested 10 billion dollars for the old musical chambers and it depends on the repair techniques undertaken I 'm if we just off each brick and put it back into place that 's going to be one amount of money if we take a perhaps a more pragmatic approach to be another we haven 't determined those philosophical positions from a heritage protection perspective and that 's where we 've got to speak to the wider community to ensure that we 're getting these important inputs early to ensure they give the job clarity to ensure and I come back to council I can actually say that 's how much is going to be so if you were to combine the numbers that we 're talking at the moment we 've got 100 million for provincial chambers approximately 10 million for all the musical chambers okay so this is currently that poor team puts it over to there oh yes full chambers the saw the old don 't turn to it obviously doesn 't leave enough regardless of whether it 's 30 or 40 million for the room that was our take on it and but it is it has been a significant amount of money spent protecting the asset on provincial chambers and almost nothing on old musical chambers and the building 's name is Ken risk okay yep Jenny it 's just that I think it makes how we entered we 're finished questions mrs. of questions no we 're on to debate no I just think it makes a lot of sense I think it 's a good report i look forward to seeing the numbers further down the line there is a part of me that almost thinks I 'm a big believer that you often go for the low-hanging fruit and when you 've got something the size of the Canterbury provincial chambers two very special buildings then compared with the our city building or the munis municipal chambers it 's probably more manageable a that immediately but in saying that I think this is a pragmatic approach it 's not new money it 's a reallocation of an existing budget so doing this I think as is prudent because it really ensures that there 's not going to be further deterioration which would see a far bigger financial hole potentially in the long term so look it 's a good move and it 's a very special building and I 'm really looking forward to win when they have you seen any other debate if not i 'll put the motion and _"

    "text": "see and clients welcome thank you did you want to say anything before we have questions or anything did just to kept that with respects the net for environment recovery program the key points for our council are really around what happens with the district can review obviously there 's a number of chapters there the coastal chapter and the natural and Colton cultural heritage chapters have now been notified and people have submitted on that so from that perspective those are key chapters that are important with the matters that are in the near and obviously there 's still a lot of work going on in the surface water program around flockton basin I know that the lot of work has started on that and the lower part of and the Dudley Creek area is now out for contractors to be appointed etc so that work is certainly going ahead as planned and just the other item that will be of interest to a lot of people is the fact that we have the three water 's strategy which is of course the surface water the water supply and strategies on water together as one the workers started and so that 's pleasing to see that that will become hopefully as a final draft for council by may of next year so that 's it from specifically for Christchurch City Council in dedham deputy me are just the other things I just talked about that and and the written report but that you 'll be aware that there 's a technical advisory group comprising strategic partners that is meeting to monthly we 've got a meeting next week and I intend for us to discuss the future of the the new project and and how they might set within the UDS refresh or in the UDS and how we can continue reporting on environmental projects across the strategic partners as we as we do here so it may be end up being a different format but in under different headings but I think people have certainly at UDS IC have asked for some continuation of us of collection of reporting on a on a wide range of environmental projects so that will be discussed next week and second point and disasters conference that 's here in what gurram and februari just that the title of that is the importance of the natural environment to health and well-being in a disaster and the work that 's been done around the community well-being strategy survey in the community well-being index are invaluable and information for that that talk that discussion that i 'll be giving in I know that 's been a syrah driven report surveys and and X that have been done but I think it 's important as partners we we continue with that it was an existence before the earthquake ground the quality of life survey across the 88 studies but I think there 's some really good trend data that would be good to maintain so that sometime that would be good to make sure that discussions happening Third Point I just wanted to appreciate the invitation of head from councillor Cotter to attend the land drainage recovery program working party I think that 's as begin a lot of good information that feeds into the new but I saw I can also take stuff back to and then the fourth thing was the relationship with the zone committees and I heard this morning you talking about heathkit reports coming regularly to the ITA committee and i think that 's that 's important but the heathcote reports will also be going to the christchurch we smelt and zone committee and about that next week they 've got a discussion around some of theirs with that Eric the object of that exercise is to make very visible what 's happening on the head cut and all that 's happening on the head cut and then to find what isn 't happening on the head cut and to make it happen it was in particular emphasis that we wanted to give obviously it doesn 't stop it going anywhere else no I didn 't expect it well I 'm just saying that the fact I think it 's good it 's going to both I mean with my new pattern I 've been working with that or palette or Papa horn and hit canet work because I see you know they are doing an amazing job getting the group together some sort of minutes or email or something that comes to counsel for instance as the eddington freaking Rock Brook and the record and stream it a lot of work going on Lisa I think what we 're trying to get us the link from the zoning committee 32 counts or so well discussed it on seriously I think at the zone committee and see what we can strengthen yeah cool are there any questions and Chrissy so that it was just one more surface area Christmas damn vicki was that and the other zone committee that 's relevant to yourselves as with the banks peninsula zone committee coming out of the littleton port recovery plan was the non-statutory recommendation that there 's a integrated catchment management plan for lyttelton harbour and that 's being going to be lead under the banks pinturas own committee probably through a subcommittee so and christchurch that he 's an important partner and that along with Environment Canterbury littleton port te Runanga o Ngai Tahu and both wrap a keen coker auratus is runing iso and and others them in Dhaka 's as that although that that 's come out of recovery plan some of the issues and little to no is quite related summer obviously historic and in much wider safe and in last league and in the report under recreation just do want to note the opening of the 360 trail that and I know you would the deputy Emir and other counselors for the opening and I think that 's a good opportunity for some of the natural environment and prostitution to be celebrated in and explored and also am aware that the management plan for Montgomery spur had a intermediate bike and Trek and tendon that in those discussions with the volunteers that work on the hills and kind staff to try and get that developed to replace some of the lost tricks that aren 't accessible because of rockfall I 'll do the rest by questions thank you are there any questions Yanni thank you just too pretty straightforward questions and then one probably little more interesting um just on 13 when are we likely to get a flat water facility report to Council over lots been proposed I can 't answer that no I think it 's beyond although it just says consider establishment of water sports areas beside that Ivan rabota carry us try to understand if there 's any timeframe for us getting a report looking at what those opportunities out ah think you 're going to have to ask somebody else at a different time I don 't think it 's emotion during the chief executive just under 16 actually I was it 's really impressive to see the crush it issued record lowest even number of high pollution days and I just wanted whether to bring any analysis as to why that was and how that would impact on perhaps he Ken 's thinking or our submissions to the bending of log burners or for the solid fuel Peter given that has been an issue that we that we previously have discussed as accountable and high pollution dates days are very variable each year and a very dependent on weather conditions so I know this being some work done it looking at the weather conditions this last one to compete with other winters particularly windy or enter your oops remember better than I do and you need to remember the goals for the under the next and met national environmental standard us to get down to one exceedance per year so Stephens still a long way from one so I again I can 't talk for the whole whole airplane it 's under submission it the mobilization are hearing at the moment so but the airplane is out for submission that I 'm sure you 're aware of its content site I 've liked comic little changes to that policy does that national environment standard come in it 's already in and it 's piled up wind is that wind is the 16 2016 I think 2016 so that 's next year but maybe three to three exceedance in 2016 can in sorry I because it 's there 's two steps to it I know that now I 'm sorry I don 't know the date 60 just just a kind of bigger question which is obviously the visibility of the nerve and all the different projects has been really good but do of the earthquake effects on earth city to kind of inform our spending priorities going forward you mean a no a retrospective locket dump it what why is she looking at what the environment one tackle the earthquake has been so underneath the nupe itself that to prepare for the new did that i suppose in my ongoing thinking and presentations sir conferences as continually to look at that I don 't there 's no formal assessment required expected or planned for but that 's something we could talk about it the technical advisory group about about doing some reflection before we pass the noobs through to the UDS just really if we were looking at an opportunity to prioritize whereas many should go to make the biggest impact on getting a better environment where would we where would we spend that money and what would inform that their prioritization the intention of the new per set all the work that 's been done and is being done reversed and back to the responsible entity and and that they continue and those decisions are made for councils through their LTP go on forever and we do need to get back to sort of as usual thank you any other questions so here 's proceed I just wanted to ask you about in terms of the connection with the natural environment and its recovery and people 's recovery and you gave the example of the 360 trail which we opened the other saturday and i just wanted if like you 'll be aware that counts all prepare quite a lot of maps for local people including met what you know current local walks both you know the larger ones across the foothills and smaller ones remembers wondering if that might be and for the area of say psychosocial recovery if you think that council might be able to add to that by way of where a lot of the walking tracks are where the places people can cycle and that kind of thing in really i guess extend the mapping we 've already done it there 's a lot of that information available it 's just probably not all in one place here and what I 've been suggesting to the the river is to think about doing similar signage to this 360 trails that because the tabs are already there but it 's connecting them up and ensure advising people went across the river so we 're the pamphlets of the right method of letting people know about that now I 'm you notice any brothers and other methods the rod Donald Conservation Trust has been sorry the road on of exponential trust has has done a lot of work of looking at the mapping death and all the tricks no matter who owns them or managers them on the portholes and right through banks peninsula so that there is information there it 's the absolute opportunity yes okay thank you thank you very much indeed guys so moved by Paul seconded by Jimmy I 'll put it those in favor please say aye those _"

put the report as a whole so are you right why is it oh sorry page 179 it starts on put that those in favor please say aye those opposed carried and strategy and Finance at page 253 and moved Jamie seconded David part a and the report back on the CEO report and then Part B and C yani yeah just to set a question um there 's a number of things in this and then report back around LTP but I just wanted to check one that one submission that can remind was around the central city rubbish collection and it seemed a pretty straightforward thing and I was just wondering if it had any progress on that or whether there 's anything we need to do it 's not quite so straightforward for lots of reasons but we agreed that to be a report back to council in February what so are a range of things so for instance that some changes to contracts there are issues about access so some of those not just about putting everything on the road and there are the community to talk to there 's a not it not everyone in the community wants through the cube side guns okay so we 're getting report back in February yeah Museum you want to get this another to burn I 'm just my face there 's any way to get it sooner than bigger cuz that 's like an onion a lot of weight to do yeah and there 's a whole lot of other work that you also asking us to do ok so it 's coming but does have a contemporary is it the CBD was it just a DVD it was the people who made this missions at the LTP on I brought it much ok ok so it 's coming back in fig tree thank you so with that I 'll put the report as a whole yesterday and I 'm on item six actually but we 've got them seeking to is what we 're currently on and 7 and Part B put that those in favor please say aye I supposed carried thank you and I 've missed one page 195 the block offer and feel I think what might be sensible is do you want to delegate this to infrastructure to add the appendix and just to find if there 's any fine-tuning and coming from the day 's discussion and also I 'm aware we had a an opinion from a legal opinion from keon or information as well so that could I guess if they if the Sun if we could delegate the signing off decision to the infrastructure trades with Environment Committee there that process would work best okay so moved fold the final sign off at the infrastructure committee there was a number of people who made submissions and they 've sent through the things that they want incorporated practically all of which are incorporated in their councils submission but there 's no capacity for the public to make submissions on this so that we agreed to do it at the infrastructure committee by way off at 2014 as well and the legal opinion which just for anybody 's benefit probably costs I don 't know seven dollars twelve dollars fifty what 's 20 minutes of your time priceless that 's it sorry it 's not thousands of dollars is what it was an internal legal run pager okay ask for that one one of the interesting suggestions one of the interesting comments made by in in the verbal one that was just the lack of the four well beings and local government act so that we can 't actually act to protect the economic and environmental well-being right right okay but not a lot of jurisdiction over there deep-sea oil area okay right I 've got okay I 've got so um have we got people here for questions or okay so initially questions you 've got a question Glynn and then I 'll take speakers yeah just over our relationship with MKT so I do notice impact on Molly there are two points there it says people can make your own submissions but we do have that living relationship so how might that submissions to the government on this e we have 0 and local authorities okay yeah but we do have a relationship with them so there are sense in which we okay the report sees no impact but actually oh they can make they are allowed to make their own submission it 's on this here we inhabit locking we do in partnership hello do you want to come and answer any questions I even though it 's tough it is it appropriate that we asked some of you I 've got Diane coming in as well okay right okay other any other questions welcome down okay yep yani well just um just wanted to just check in terms of the resolutions today I 'd like to make some in traditional resolution so would you like me to do that now what do you want just do you want to tell us what they are yeah there 's several the first one is in the submission actually just adding a 1.3 under one point to this is given the concerns are the above concerns the council as opposed as opposed to straightforward right the second one is just in regards to the resolutions as to that the council requests II can to make a submission and send a copy of our submission learning our concerns that we also circulate and write to local MP relevant ministers and and just to basically make our views no I think what MMP okay when we come today you need to start thinking so you 're just foreshadowing those by wave a dish edition okay let 's call yep okay you 've got one to bully one tell us for this well it 's this relating to ian 's and emo here and it 's about the potentially adverse economic impacts in 1816 states that offshore operators heather limited resolution for costs but um he says it might be an idea to provide details of these commitments so we could ask them to do that I think it would be be friendly feeling there and that came up in the submissions from the public as well yeah much are they actually liable for because their suggestion was that it was extremely low oh no the also i would like to include the effect that was pointed out in a an email from Charles grace that our waters are particularly rough and it has a different type of probably different risk then drilling it needs another risk so you just like those things he loaded in the submission okay and if we delegate to the infrastructure committee to finalize it that would take cab there so my question was along the same lines that 's probably to end just a sort of clarify for us because i 'm just that point pulling her attention to around the am liability and limited liability for costs and the event of of an oil spill whereas the information we received from the sub muscles was that around the penalty that there was our maximum penalty kind of a like a limited to 10 million just wonder if you might better explain it but further in well actually I can 't because I don 't know enough about about that all I 'm passing on to you is that the information that indeed PM has will provides is that there say well whatever the cost so we could seek clarification around there in SF that 's what I 'm suggesting thank you very much that we seek clarification about the extent of that and also get confirmation that the council is regarded as one of the third parties that would be entitled to damages we just need to know for sure that that is the case think they place a more substantial bond 15 million that 's pathetic well I don 't know whether that 10 million is is accurate or not it talks about unlimited liability which you know could be billions of dollars so yes we should get this from NZ p.m. yes i pasted into the PM i think that cool okay yeah so are we on to debate now I 'll just want a question with regards to and then kind of mentioned the partnership between be in ourselves and the other partnership we have is that weekend so we have the right we have the responsibility to the high-tide mark he can have the rest I understand that they are not putting in a submission the fair meadows we have concerns but it is only to the high tide which is ridiculous we were talking about deep-sea drilling so just like Snow White partners aren 't if they 're not concerned but I wasn 't aware that they weren 't making a mission Jana distinction that before summer assuming i actually asked them and they 're not so if we could sorry because I mean the flip top concerns which I think are very valid quiet partners time yeah there 's somebody back and talk to over there who I know was involved and the submission i believe it was last year so they did do a submission they did do it a submission last year so a second the silent well apparently not well could we ask this is it appropriate on us absolutely you can ask what you like yep okay so if there 's no further questions is that we 've got a mover have we we 've got canceled of clear water and counselor skander at the second eggs and uni debate ah sorry yeah yeah do you want to put the ite be delegated to prove the final submission which will include the appendix and then yannis got second one that the council requests II came to make a submission that we request for we formally request a can to make the submission and circulate a copy of hours to them yeah in the third one that the council add an additional 1.3 to our submission the state 's given the above concerns we are opposed to the 2016 fulfilled I think that 's that 's fine you can just do that can you 'll just do it just make it clear cuz I did yeah okay okay and then the third one um that the council right to mp 's ministers with a copy of our submission expressing our concerns and I just the reason for doing that is with MMP week I think one of the things we do is we write to the government ministers all time but actually what we need to understand through Parliament is there 's different political parties that make up the government the Maori Party Act New Zealand first and that I start to express our views to those other parties who are part of the decision-making at central government we and and just so that they 're aware of what our concerns are also local MPs I hope I have requested privacy that we can have a meeting with the various local MPs and the various political parties at some stage in the near future because it is important when we think about the future of a can the future of some of these submissions and regeneration that we actually do start engaging with them over trying to get the outcomes that we want for the city okay thanks Johnny so just to get this right the first one should should read at the top that the cats will formally request again to make a submission on this issue and the the second one we don 't need because we can just add that and that 's really it 's M plus it you just want to made it express it and then the council wrote to Memphis apartment administers with a copy of the council 's submission expressing concern about in oil ministers I think probably local ones do Oh if you think about how element works actually you know it 's quite common for a leader to go to all MPs and it 's actually just a it 's just an email so that we to all in peace that we go to ministers anyway yeah so just write to members of parliament we can take the medicines out so included right so just members of parliament ok ok any other debate before I put these well well I guess we 'll have some very the discussion to at the committee just but that 's more i guess the fine-tuning of it but i just want to start by saying what an excellent report diane has written for us and it 's very professional the sciences there and it 's absolutely clear and i think one of the things that I 've become clear on since it came to our committee previously is how in fact the economic benefits around deep-sea drilling are clearly overrated and the information we had around the royalties and in fact New Zealand we sort of begs a lot of questions really and and also that the any oil produced would be processed overseas other the other factor to that in fact we 've got no new zealand has no experience of of deep deep sea drilling for will we do in Taranaki but it 's a very the risks connected with deep sea drilling are just so much greater place I think it 's a serious concern that in fact we 've got this proposition the government so far as supporting but there 's been no cost benefit analysis what so ever done to date the concern to about you know a potential oil spill I 've got no doubt especially having heard the submitters is not overrated because of in fact you know a deep-sea drilling an oil spill would spread much further and even in terms of how you know there 's some limits on the drilling of course but we all know that for example the 12 for 12 nautical mile limit we all know though that in fact if there is an oil spill there 's no limit to could go to and end like we do know that that the example in the Gulf of Mexico The Horizon disaster the costs there were around 70 billion dollars this country cannot afford anything like that so I think you know too and and I think even for making a point that we need to clarify about about the liability but we and so we do need clarity and that in the event of a disaster to just what proportion of any recovery costs our city council what it would be obliged to pay so you know I 've got I 've strongly support the submission I think this is an important role for not only government but we 're local government to look after our citizens and our children in our environment so because there is clearly a combined number of threats here and it 's a very important submission to support thank you Glen I 've got next thing Yanni thank you I 'd like to begin by acknowledging yes I think it has a very good report and pointing out that in parts 1.2 and 5.3 in council this week that in fact the council was invited and has been invited it 's there in black and white to make a submission on this block over it is well within our bounds to do so we have a responsibility and in relation to that I think we have a responsibility with or to maha new akuto to uphold that Katya Catania that stewardship of our environment the full well beings technically may be out of the LGA but they pop up still in various other places and behoves us to hold to our whole domes it 's good to see also in 3.49 the reference back to our climate strategy which is now 20 years old and this council in relation to ongoing use of fossil fuels and that respect I think it 's a very good hensive report I encourage you all to support these amendments put forward which I think very good from council Johansson okay thanks Yanni yeah I 'm just to be quick I think it as an excellent submission and it raises very real and legitimate concerns and all that adds up know to me this is actually not a question of F it 's a question of when something goes wrong and this is a huge gamble to play in terms of our environment that 's a gamble that I 'm not prepared to take and I think it 's great that we 've seen this council being very progressive and us thinking around what the consequences will be when something goes wrong and if it happens to be within our area I cannot understand what and you know I want to acknowledge both sides of the political spectrum that this government and previous governments who have actually put energy into coming up with marine reserves and actually supported the idea that we would protect some of these really fundamental things that make us unique as New Zealand and encourage tourism and encourage a healthy environment so I cannot understand why we should put that at risk and when you look at the proposed block offer for our region in particular adjacent to a marine reserve it just doesn 't make any sense at all so the reality is that if as a city and us as a region and we should permanently oppose what 's being sought the issue of local democracy as I think incredibly relevant in terms of people not even having a right to have a say and so that 's why we as a council I think need to take a strong role in challenging what what this sort of behavior could lead to and the other point is you only in to look at what 's happening with fuel prices to really wonder whether this is actually a very good investment at all and I would suspect that in the short to medium term actually there 's no need for this sort of activity to be occurring and we 're much better trying to do things like build a cruise ship terminal to encourage people to come and enjoy our marine reserves or a natural environment for the things that make us unique is New Zealand or Christchurch rather than taking a high-stakes gamble such as the deep sea oil exploration thank you shall I put them separately everybody happy with all together yeah okay those opposed David Wright yep do you want it noted okay _"

    "text": "dan strategy and Finance with Dan and so we 're on to item number 25 the report of the urban development strategy implementation committee meeting which is probably a report back is it Richard hello did you want to tell us anything I think most of it a lot and report itself the purpose of these reports are simply to update Council on the torrian comings and goings of the urban development strategy implementation committee which meets monthly Council as long as they 're on clearwater in the mirror set on that and really the statistical council or the other councillors who don 't sit on that committee informed of what happens most information is contained in the minutes that form part of the Appendix probably is a mixed report I provide to you which will be an update on the UTS refreshers going to be a little more substantive than this one on the previous one okay thank you so moved moved clean seconded le but that yeah Nia thanks um I just note in here that you talked about the Refresh by April 2016 I had prepared in concerned that there were other processes under way to kind of look at not just a central city vision for the city but actually a vision for the entire Christchurch I was just concerned that to do a UDS refresh by April 2016 with the holidays in the middle seems like an incredibly challenging challenging thing to do if you want to engage with the community about you know what outcomes we desire as a city so there 's anything else we should be thinking about in terms of coming up with a vision for the city that could inform this were in this time frame think of all be a challenging time frame to meet if it 's something a little bit longer but the collective view of the people we said on EDS I see was that it be done by April but there will be some work post that day so I think that the anticipation is that will bring together the high level vision refresh the strategy that will be summarized into a short but succinct document that the work will continue to be ongoing post that as anticipated that they 'd be quite extensive engagement and but that 's probably going to be the subject of when I bring the Refresh proposal to you at the next council committee meeting and we can get into the detail of what that looks like because the UDS I see are keen for individual councils to endorse and the UDS refresh and that was presented to you dear so I see recently so I 'm trying to understand because this councils talk a lot of that grassroots up rather than top-down approach so what 's the opportunity for us to have a grassroots approach so that people feel meaningfully engaged at the start of a process rather than what we 've traditionally had in the last few years which is being told what 's happening EG the blueprint I think good opportunity no not feel so do we okay well that Wells that that 's what we 'll discuss at the next media but there is a process which has been developed for pretty wide-ranging engagement on the UDS refresh but I think you need to bear in so it 's not getting down into you can do that on this site and this on another site it really seeks a click division for greater Christchurch and says does that still fit into to sum up what that vision currently is in two words it 's about their than consolidation that 's what we talked about are we achieving that for not what do we need to do better there 's a whole lot of other stuff that sits underneath it but that 's that to me is the key premise which are going C okay thank you _"

    "text": "thing the east side is yeah okay right okay I 'm just going to go onto rigs and consents because I see Todd Weebly is here with us but I did want to acknowledge and I forgot to and I

actually I found with my wife we 've had nothing but good response to everything we 've done we 've we 've actually thoroughly enjoyed our few days here and can I also say that the people of Christchurch although I don 't know if you 've heard about it but we were all so sad to hear about the earthquake we tend to think that those things don 't happen in your only other people 's back gardens but coming over here and seeing it and seeing the damage that has been done and the work that you have on behalf of the people your community getting any questions back on its feet again get in the community behind you and working hard to bring Christchurch back to where it should be and where it was before thank you very much thanks Mike you 're welcome and Christchurch any time can I also say that i was on the pie was chair of planning I was also chair of the policy of resources so it 's very difficult to work out how much you can without getting the community on your back so I 've got a broad bag and I 've taken it for 20 years so that 's about it Thank You thanks Mack um rigs and concedes committee we 're going to move on to Dave okay a number of parte matters to consider that this one is the adoption of the annual report to the alcohol licensing and regulatory authority we required each year to prepare and send to the ARL a a reporting of their district licensing proceedings and operations during that year and we 're required to do that within three months of the end of our financial year so the reporters appended and I would move the committee and staff recommendation sit out and forth to enough room thank you and seconded by a 10 okay item number one item number 22 is the temporary alcohol ban in the Riccarton racecourse area the staff recommendation is set out and night and point three of the paper on page 221 it 's essentially providing for the same provisions that we have at the trotting Cup event at addington to shocking galloping cup yep so it 's pretty straightforward and it 's a temporary one because we would have to go through the consultative process to actually eventually make it a part of our Bible yep and it 's been requested also by the local community board right I 'll put that those in favor please say aye those opposed carried the next one I 'm assuming capsules Eastern skanda removing all of these Megan Jessica sake of terms that will lead us now on the third one as relates to the police delegation to the police to enforce the public bylaws our public places by Lord respective vehicle windscreen washing activities it 's been brought to our attention that the police don 't have quite the authority to do to deal with these issues around surrounding windscreen washing activities and by giving them delegation to enforce our by law they have a greater ability to control this activity which in itself has been as much a an issue of health and safety and then we also have the allegation of some gang activity also being associated with window agent 've got clear have we and Todd do you want to come forward I 've got Todd weebly from the police and clear bright so the stuff of the staff and committee recommendation has set out on points 3.1 to 3.5 on page 229 so we 've got the staff the committee and the police and agreement on the proposed section are there any questions recommendation do you want to tell us what it is and then i 'll just go back to christian sister with respect for Washington carowinds things became a reward perhaps us taxi any activity that causes these sort of issues around for getting painful reward so rather than discipline screen mode no no no way outside the scope of this report you 're venturing into an area from which we have no information no report no staff recommendation no good try big you 're not going to get away with their that 's the place to question you let 's revise are you can rest up release a question on this subject who would you like to on this subject no this one fool yeah this one on window window washers yeah you have to try harder yeah nice thank you I just wanted to acknowledge 3.5 and work that it 's enabling pleasant team of doing and I just wondered if you could elaborate on you know it 's one thing to come come down on someone for doing something that you don 't want but actually addressing the cause of the behavior as a starting point for changing the behavior to me is really important and i know that you obviously thought about that because 3.5 discuss is a little bit but could you just elaborate what what counsel in the place are working towards in terms of understanding why people are doing this and looking at other initiatives or other interventions that actually understand why people do it and try and come up with alternative ways of encouraging better behavior is different i canna i condemn the answer that question obviously used we are seeking authority because we will require an enforcement talk to go up to discourage this behavior they also want we 're looking at ways to encourage not to early intervention we 've been working with a number of other agencies including the council in identifying youth that are not engaged in education courses or work and in coming up with strategies and implementing it so Mike can you give me a life and in particular you that are not engaged in schools with issue working with the minister of education at the moment and they 've actually created a team specifically dealing with the issues and around the Longwood area we 've identified a lot of issues and around that jolly street Thomas Street inferior there we live so we 're doing some intensive work with not only other be used but the families so we utilize in the Minister of Education a little annoyed link if we coming on board with that c yd p Canterbury youth development program which are now based at the Phillips town community up the form over focus on primary school we working alongside them a number of witnesses have been taken under their umbrella and we also liaison with them in relation to to how we can help with that university quite some time now he 's actually some had put this into our one of his courses and coming up with initiatives and they presented to to to what at that community hub along with police and other interested members on initiatives that we 're going to implement and particularly there 's a sporting initiative that looks like we might be able to get up and running by using another student doing another course cpit particularly the trades side of things and particularly i 'm weeping with them I 've been talking with hemi to him eat and relation to marry and getting marry into trades and within utilizing their local businesses the chemin board with us you 've got some couple of years of some work in relation to right now in the business but local businesses can come aboard seeking nominations from us which has been fantastic recruitment agencies there 's about 160 recruitment agencies across us right now screaming at the staff so we 've been involved with that with help develop a one simple one-page cv wood and put them into debt down at the community have to fill it out and we deliver it so we 're pretty much very hands-on I had to write something stuff there cuz it 's ever so much going on we organized a barbecue I saw it in the eastgate mall car park and recently and that was actually to encourage them to come over and talk to us and that worked really well as a result of that we 're planning to do something through similar probably at side learn would link we 're having none of these other agencies that are involved with with us while our commando for the sausage by you here come talk to this person or talk to this person not my voice the truancy side of things early on when we were looking at this problem or issue i should say we were a local petrol station chain got on board and we were actually looking at trying to legitimize this put these these use through four chord ethical courses give them safety equipment and that was meet with a number of noodles which unfortunately did not venture eight for a number around it say in saying that we want to enforce it we also want to discourage it we want to get youth and those sort of people into legitimate work courses of in education so this is a number of streams I probably haven 't known them all but it is definitely a lot of work around it George 's just to add to their or meet with the with the police on this issue after their roots and consents meeting with the valley osteen from the University of candid with Rachel right from you see innovators with to your hoe and we 've got another meeting scheduled for Thursday of next week so if you want to come you 're very welcome looking at a number of specific suggestions that arose out of that and in particular I think we 've invited the organizer of high-tech usage which is running in Dunedin and Auckland and send through it some of the islands he 's been avoid we 're talking with them to initiate some sort of program here and cry sheesh so yeah like the cops the good parts there a degree of self-responsibility where are the parents and families and this I mean what I 'm hearing is that there is a massive amount of resource and clearly cost attached to that as well and I don 't want to dismiss any of the difficulties or situations that these kids are in but surely you have to draw a line somewhere and say enough is enough is self responsibility and family support that is required here I definitely and like it like I said we 've recognized we 've identified a specific area within the community that a lot of this youth in family issues messing around at la materia and so we were working with families it 's not just the youth as the family one of the issues we 've got around this behavior is the fact that it is very lucrative and very encouraging because some of these boys are making up to 62 seven dollars an hour I wonder washing so to discourage that is very difficult and they would be an argument there would be some people out there they would say oh the bats they getting it the other trying to do an honest day 's work and look and I we recognize that side of it unfortunately the behavior around it and it 's not just the one that was just because the one of washings attracting they mate and then we give him up to 20 to 30 odd youths at intersections that aboard with nothing to do in causing a lot of disorder but you rocked there 's a point and i can give you an a good example was i am working with a boy he is 16 years old and we 're looking to try and get him into trades he is very keen he was unfortunately he slipped up a little bit he 's currently in custody but and i just saying is there a point we give up well i 'm still going to work with his boy he stole i 'm working with a youth a chore youth services section and we we 've got a money a raider and we 're not looking we can try when we 're going to keep going write his family support not very good very difficult circumstances for him he 's obviously influenced by others so it 's just and sometimes and if you I 've spoken to adults that have been youth offenders in right through and then I said sometimes it 's a it 's that 20th time that someone spoken to them and dealt with them said look hey you can 't_''_949.089 do this we got it is that that last twenty or twenty 30th time that 's gone yeah you 're right so is he getting involved with he is getting in for my juice right so that 's a fetch there 's a polyp it 's yeah thank you okay Glenn thank you my questions around the funding so I 'm pretty happy with how much Hechavarria made gets as aboard by way of Social Development and that will include youth development as with all our boards just wondering how well-connected that is with some of the agencies working in the space you should wash partners from him sure I 'm sure how you and working in the heck is Aaron even going on with and Todd and his team among the neighborhood safety panel for Phillip stone there 's little big stands out that 's wondering who 's gonna do their heard my money on Ellie Orton I was just talking about the neighborhood safety panel that is based in philipstown that has been following the developments in the lynnwood area and largely at that eastgate mall so we have held meetings from a council perspective with eastgate shopping center local policing staff local youth workers who are working in school and in the wider area to try and link the young people a lot of whom are on that margin who could go either way into programs that will mean we don 't have to end up with the experience of interventions we have a Lynnwood youth development worker who is funded through metro funding as a key local project and they 're able to work with the different youth organizations to sort of say hey this is what 's going on here so some of the young people you 're talking about the window-washing an issue have worked alongside cases to get one or two young people to participate in local and you think activities without having to go down that extreme pathway I think one of the issues that the youth workers do find if they aren 't a lot of funnel and family workers in the area and so they find they working with the young person they 're working with the community in terms of out of school they working with the schools in school but they don 't have that support from fellow workers are working with the family which was your concern around how do they better manage the dynamics of young boys and girls who need that extra support large number coming from Maori families and so we have talked to here or on opponent the nail Tahoe around what is it we could possibly do together to get a Maori response for Maori young people thanks police for the work that you are doing in there that would with him in a really pleased with some of the advanced you made towards actually helping youth here and this is a shameless plug Mills building tomorrow and if you want to give some money towards the foundation of the youth development and I have a width page on the government page right there 's a shameless it 's not a question but it is an important issue that we use for their youth and I don 't think there 's enough attention given to these organizations to actually help these kids air thank you for that question Andrew assuming that we make this decision today and that obviously gives the police the ability to enforce this bylaw one of the things that has been said to me my various conversations around this particular matter has been often by the time a member of the public makes the police aware that there 's a problem in a particular location by the time the police are able to get there the problem is dissipated or the activity as ceased what sort of strategies will you put in place or how will you be able to perhaps more effectively deal with this as a result of the recommendation that 's in front of us today yep one to love meanie that we want to implement can rest assured that the reason we want to force the spoil or is but it is before that the issue or the problem has come to tension through disorderly behavior intimidation so the me effect of window washing is an offense that should be stopped so in the past we have had to wait till the fights broken out or someone said I 've just been timid 80 or my window my window has been smashed off my car and you 're right the time we get there they have just scattered to the four winds so it 's we 're kind of using this enforcement or as a prevention measure that 's a bit like they 're broken windows theory is it is dealing with that although you know we have to know the window-washing behavior on its on its own is not a serious matter and they are definitely some safety implications for these people that are doing it it is it is looking at the future and if we let it I hope to continue throughout the other issues arising I what uses time to to point out turn and I think there 's there was an issue around that work which there was a concern that youth are going to end up with a conviction I 'm not to rest assured that the children young person 's family X tall would be applied here and if it is a youth 16mm and younger they will not be someone 's and there will not be required to go to court it will just be of what 's called a youth aid matter and they 'll be get be referred to a youth aid section and and the net and it 's been itself as a way of us identifying a youth in that needs some of these other interventions that were talking about which will be implementing it will be the rear occasion a youth would have to be fronted up to use court only circumstances that we can think of that there would happen is they 're already on some other serious offenses where that when the washing boil or things would be added to it 're a youth you 'll never in trouble anyone before you 're going to go to court it will be a youth that is it would be an ongoing problem that we have been up to address okay thank you i pulling up Celine yeah you thinking thanks given that you 're doing in the community we and I know the grassroots approach is the only way to go in bringing when not to give a nice bike I 'm just good timing so each and um youth Leslie not all Bob you so this viola will make the superlative activity this right and I notice six one sees without permission from the council will be beanie why people could apply and be granted permission I attended over to know well um you know without I 'm pretty tuning any different sorry without pre determining anything sort of decision five staff on that matter the reality is there we the staff when their issue improvements for activity under the public places by law take safety into consideration and under these circumstances there 's no traffic management plane they 're actually that payment wouldn 't be approved under those right so we basically don 't be in this activity and even though you do the state this is some people do you think that 's quite a good so thinking the wind spring washed at an intersection do we agree to in to consult on this it just takes it on to the one well to some extent I guess we would consult on the public beta follow and the regular review process and in entered originally when it was it up and of course this is they aren 't taking a commercial activity in the sense that they do expect to receive an income from it they do expect some money in exchange for the service and so there does that is all it so that has been as part of the bylaw you know so as an activity which is any fickt expecting an it 's an effective commercial activity nes the bile or does be in commercial activity already we would be in consult consultation on this bile or occurs if it gets reviewed during 2017 we did they get the aim of this was to discourage it so if they did it they were maybe 17 or 18 or 20 and that the first one would not be a visit to the court but it was actually spiral who answered it and he said no no no we 're doing you know oh dear good we have a discretion and I was my hair done and it will implement in a warning face yeah you know that he 's these kids out there earning money and we know we 've got an issue was people digging in the city and stuff like that he their earning money we 're going to stop it we were they going to get that money from that actually they 've just become accustomed to getting I can get a job no no but in the short term in well that 's what the the meetings were about and so this is the risk of obviously stopping this activity isn 't that 's why the book or this planet gotcha talk about the is what this could be quick one displacement so one and that 's why we 're implementing a lot of other initiatives to to mitigate that sure we may have other offenses committed because we 've done this but i like to call it positive displacement in fact that we start with decreasing the behavior or all the pavers surrounding that the youth activity are you saying that it 's pretty much these things people doing this in how many are there well numbers are very hard to to attribute Theo is definitely a very it was definitely a core core group and there was what was what we were noticing is the reason that I became involved is because I on so on the surgeon charge at the Phillips town David police team and in mid-2013 as the intersection of all runs about coolers rotors we seem to be where it sort of originated at then grew throughout the city and we started seeing in Section cómo es F if first fear is north and q EG drive so we 're not actually just looking at a limb would look Taylor would issue we 're looking at a spread throughout the city and the numbers will use it she 's increased exponentially over quite over a period of time you know we were expecting that they will probably be a few small percentage of hardcore just I will keep doing this and we don 't care about enforcement and boilers and things like that but this that 's that this the group that we watch they want to target for obviously discouraged and then also encouraged to do something supportive today the message would be to go out to people in their cars and they will okay don 't pay them anyways it it seemed a loser I mean you know like it 's that some of that some of the information we getting back people just feel like they have to page just to avoid any report reprisals there 's an inertia affected their people that will not drive through certain sections because they believe that window washers will be these okay Paul 's got one last question and then I 'm aware that we 're going to find out this part of the meeting facility because allowing this activity to occur is actually exposing these young people to gang mentality initiation other gangs have you seen much of it that little bit is definitely that 's a hard one to answer because I don 't feel that you have to but like ants ideas against ideas there 's been a gang element to it we have seen on occasions we believe that some of these use have been what we call text they 've been allowed to work it at a certain transition because a certain gang made control it again a lot of this is in a girdle because you talk to these guys they will not tell you that they have been text they will not say that we 're working for again but there 's definitely circumstantial evidence that would suggest that is occurring okay so if there 's no more questions is there any debate or can I the motion there is debate okay Ellie thank you um I think that I find part of this quite difficult to get my head around because it seems very very black and white to be a badge I we 're often this is a no-brainer these kids are at risk of hurting themselves of hurting others there is quite clearly a very strong suggestion of being involved you can address it to the rest of the council rather than just click on time yeah okay yeah um oh don 't worry about it not forget it that 's right we 'll move on that 's fine I 'll see what I Lisa my view on this is I support a two-fold approach firstly I do support the upholding or rather the empowering the police over this clearly there 's a problem I can think of one intersection the window washers the light okay ants over sugar we need we need to deal with this but we also need to take a long-term developmental approach I do agree partly over their individual responsibility but not everyone 's develop the tools to take responsibility so we actually do need I think to act as a council to keep working through our agencies with our partnerships and funding to take that long term view and so I 's before us but we actually need to work at the other side of the equation at in the product of space as well in that regard I can mean to you the work of people such as bib and seal doing great stuff in the city and I think that that 's the kind of approach the council needs to take okay thanks I 'm Paul yarny then Andrew and I sorry Paul yani okay cool yani Andrew Devlin yep I 'm going to support the recommendation today and mainly because I want to support the police who have clearly shown not just actually want to enforce this rule they want actually engage with these youths and make a difference in their lives and put them in a bit of direction and we 've seen some great examples here today I basically have it as she done that so i think is she enable them to issue get this issue under control and keep these you safe on these intersections it gives me another further opportunity to bring them into some of these other programs that can actually see just need to get behind in this full Thank You Danny yeah thank you I probably the last person that would support giving the police more powers to take on our young people in fact i made my name actually challenging the police to the Human Rights Commission over the under-25 scheme but actually when you look at the difference and approach here it 's quite staggering and that 's why I will support this approach because not just being hard on people without understanding the cause of the behavior to me is really important and addressing the causes of behavior is the best way in my view to get behavior change and enforcement should only be a measure and a mechanism of last resort and what we 've heard today is the fairly extensive programs and processes that the community the place the council are looking at to address the cause of this behavior and I wholeheartedly endorse that approach it 's really interesting to reflect on the Phillipstown policing team it wasn 't so long ago that the police had a very different approach to Philip some which resident many people will actually stop for no reason or other than just being in your car sitting in your car drinking a redbull or a can of coke and you interrogated as to what you were doing there the approach the police have taken in more recent years is very different that 's actually working with these local communities to identify the issues that are relevant to them it 's building confidence and trust and the organizations that exist in our city whether it 's government departments or community agencies to help the people that need the help so I 'm very supportive of this approach I originally thought maybe it 's not such a big deal I 'd driven through a lot of these intersections myself in a never filled felt scared or intimidated it wasn 't until the police came to our community board and actually showed us the video footage of what was happening at these intersections that I that I understood how frightening it is for people to be intimidated and how dangerous it is for these young people and others who are doing this that we have to act on this issue I do think there is a wider issue in our city in terms of what 's happening in some communities around the the rising inequality post-earthquake the issue around where we prioritize our spending as we recover and the impact that things like affordable housing have on families and all communities and some of the poorest areas of our city are having a pronounced impact and I again commend the work that 's been done with ycd around the youth the youth homelessness issue or the transiency issue because that is all part of this picture and nathan young people regardless of their circumstance to contribute positively in our city should be I think our top priority and so I just wanted to endorse the approach that 's being taken I do support this because it is being done with the people that are most affected to try and find solutions to what is I think a very real and legitimate problem thank you Andrew yeah what we 've got in front of us today is a practical and pragmatic and inclusive this matter was coming in front of us I 've deliberately driven through some of the affected intersections over the last few weeks and whilst and certainly acknowledge and come the castle Johansson was made I haven 't felt intimidated myself I 've seen behavior that it 's easy to see why a person would avoid those intersections or would feel an aircraft to lock their car doors as they go through those intersections or whatever and from what we 've heard this morning clearly this is a far bigger issue than just people washing windows at intersections there is very conflict complicated and complex social issues behind this and from that point of view I 'd like to acknowledge that the work that the police and our staff have done in working to achieve good social outcomes as they address this I think a heavy-handed approach possibly would have unintended outcomes the approach that 's been described to us today certainly is inclusive and works to good social outcomes from something which is perhaps a symptom of other social problems as well as been a problem in itself so us today as a way of dealing with this and I 'm particularly happy to support it in the context of those wider pieces of work that we 've heard about today I also understand the call for parents and families to step up to support some of these young people who were involved in this activity and maybe by implication other activities as well but I think there needs to be an acknowledgement that there isn 't the capability or the capacity in those families and support networks necessarily always do that and in fact that some of these people maybe don 't have well-functioning families or support networks at all so very pleased to support this particularly in the context of that wider really valuable work that we 've heard about today thank you and Dave to wind up the debate thank you look this matter has had quite an earring for quite some time in the regulations and consents Committee and I 'm very comfortable with the debate and discussion that 's that 's been had at that meeting I think for me one of the the bylaws as councils ability to enforce the bylaws that we have on our books and I 've been on record as saying that I think some of our bylaws we create bylaws that we we we overlook the ability to enforce them at times we place a huge burden on our enforcement staff and i am very complimentary of the efforts of that unit and enforcing our bylaws but in this case here i think it 's entirely appropriate that we extend the ability for the police to actually enforce this part of a bylaw i 've been on record and saying that is a particularly unusual situation with with health and safety being one of the key attributes that we 're trying to address here and then we have alleged intimidation and a few other unsavory activities that are being associated with it so I 'm very comfortable in supporting this motion today because I believe that does allow an organization like the police to actually be able to deal with the situation and a professional and in far greater capacity then we can at council level so I the this part of the report which I think we 've already perfect we 've got to move her in a second ahead way Megan yep cool okay so I 'll put it those in favor please say aye those opposed carried unanimously was it through fairly well and actually just let me check that because I 'm aware that there 's a 12 club opening as it 's there a lot of discussion on dogs what oh it 's really try again another yeah okay is everybody comfortable with it okay right so it 's move Dave seconded by Tim I 'll put it those in favor please say aye those opposed carried reported the whole we adopted those in favor please say aye those opposed to carry _"

originally carry through but it 's since been pretty much surrounded by and having it can 't go anywhere now this is the process to go through but basically we 're delegating the property consultancy manager to proceed with this releasing of the land it market value and it 's too clean suit listen we 'll have to be part of the reserves act as well and the all these surrounding properties have been approached and asked if they 're interested in nobody is except one who 's interested in a.m development via for aged care facility so in the Lord 's quite comfortable with this boards comfortable self said staff recommendation okay so moved Pauline cigna Delhi yep put that those in favor please say aye those opposed Harry the remainder of the report move Ali seconded Pauline sis the next book the same one I 'm sorry there is no remainder at i-40 part be on page 163 and that 's moved le seconded Pauline I 'll put those those in favor please say aye sorry yonni sorry Lily wanted to just GS Aria gone to a quick Yanni did you swore no we were just we were just been critical of Sarah around removing trees we were going to remove 23 trees and 8.1 now we 're removing 11 so I just wondered you know kind of this is an issue that has been raised with us um through our district plan yeah that contractors taking out on trees let us interrupt leone because this was actually an incredibly good process skirt was wanting to needing to remove some trees out at Spencer all dear now we organized a community meeting was good there was a good attendance we talked through with the people why they had to come out though actually we 're not fit for the location anyway so they had to come out for underground sewer appears there 's no choice however I see they 've come up with a different plan now but they may still come out to be part of choosing new trees and planting and they were quite happy about it they weren 't healthy trees so I think that 's the key if there 's any tree removal proposed to keep the people around and talk about it and explain why they 're coming out for starting the way forward in this very consistent approach because our board constantly gets memo saying these trees are going to be remote yeah and there 's often no opportunity for us that 's not the issue here yeah so these guys are happy with this process we were greatly did you have a question at all or comment no I was just going to mention the edible gardens which is at the bottom of page 163 these were started by Shirley papanui third years yep fujiya hugely successful fantastic support from schools and kids primarily but also elderly who have got small gardens residential homes as well we want to raise it up a level we want to have a launch event for the registrations for them an M seed sort of evening as well but just some fruit and one chap put in basically an Asian garden and everything that it produced was either an Asian plant or an Asian fruit and there was stuff there that many of us have never seen before it was really really amazing but it 's the kids getting involved as well there 's a lot of volunteer hours and I would encourage any other community boards who want to grow gardens and work with their communities to get involved in this again using the Shirley papanui board model which is hugely successful okay thank you page 165 8.6 we still haven 't had any results from this water testing of this contaminated linen North Florida pond and it was ducks and geese and all sorts of things counting it about palin gorillas are three three months ago that 's a month so Jane can you follow up on that we 're waiting for the now the results are run but they 're being in alized so but Jane 's on it we need to know what what 's caused us yeah yeah thank you yep okay um i 'll those opposed carried and the next one so from page 174 once again item seven so we 've got issues with the sticks the flooding and we 've had several quite angry community meetings so what the board has done is we 're setting up a community group and it will have representatives from various residents associations in community rexana plus community board rips and we 're actually going to get an independent facilitator so that 's going to be another really good process to try and take the community along and help them deal with these very very very challenging flooding issues surround the sticks okay so that 's a really positive thing that the board 's doing as well thank you so moved Pauline second did Ellie put that those in favor please say aye aye those opposed carried and it 's now just on an after 11 how would it be if you have what 10 minutes morning tea can back by 11 15 it 's 12 minutes be incredibly generous I 'm aware that some of you or some

    "text": "you say a report starting on page under the 41 we do have a partay matter um regarding our funding and despair strengthening communities funding in their room the ability to transfer funds over remaining funds to air on discretionary response funds and just something that sexually in practice a bit now but what we just wanted to do was actually formalize that so that we 're not so that we 'd seemed to be open and transparent about it madam mayor and council awesome so what it we just move that council approve that absolutely been wonderful yep so Jimmy will move that and I 'll second that so council approved actually not just you can we approve any board doing that so we don 't want every board to come back and ask that was the intention of the motion them we can 't do that ok so we proof your board specially but just note any other community board if you want to do that obviously you 're going to get the mission so what we were hoping for is the couch will actually make resolve that might just need a paper up to do this okay yeah well we 'll just approve this one yeah this one yes the domes of ok tune will approve this one now and then just get rid of the silly world later okay thank you sorry yeah well yeah cancel yeah it does need to go quite so cancel approve that the board can reallocate any other sport and speed portion of its strengthening community fund just what 's the year and to its discretionary response fan to full stop ok come now any and sport enhancement can tell us approximately what that figure is micah solely an idea in this particular case it was a figure of twenty-two thousand dollars it was for a salary but and we didn 't know whether we didn 't know if the granted that money whether the person would could be continuing in that role so we held it over into actor we 've got some clarification on that so that money was sitting in the deer and the strengthening communities fun if it hadn 't have been spent we have committed that did really wish to be able to transfer that 22k to our dr if fun so that we could actually spend it and in the area and that 's where it 's needed so that was that was the issue so it was more than 15k that was mentioned in the report but in this particular instance with our board was 22 cake okay so we 've got a recommendation near and Jimmy 's moving at full second ago you 've got that okay i 'll put that those in favor please say aye those opposed carried Part B anything they 're just lots of grants doesn 't it yeah just just an exciting time for all board sexually making those droughts available taro very very important community groups and organizations ok Jimmy moves and Dave seconds I 'll put that those in favor please good good just one grant stood out there 3d chair and chair I want to be Presbyterian Church struck me is a lot of money 31,000 we had the key local projects secret thickness is one of them through your board but outside of that isn 't here eh I 'm I 'm not be able to offer an explanation the Presbyterian for the hope of churches it 's referring to at amys road is a community organization that does quite a lot of outreach pro and quite a lot it 's a very very important community service provider and community support provider in our ward so instead of like a lot of them in other Ward 's a pepper potted more around but this particular church organization and is one of its roles is offering support to and projects in the community in a wider area so that 's why that particular organization is getting quite a significant amount of funding because they do a significant amount of work in our area ok ok thank you ok right I 'll put the reports hold those in favor please say aye those close to carried and the next one on page 149 yeah just like to mention that we do it did have a deputation from from sarah hyland about the Templeton golf course and the the application that 's been put in for um where the process fits through the the district plan review resource can see it 's coming in to change the use and the ability to actually be involved in that processes of but I 'm very very unclear actually so we 're just seeking some clarification on how those steps take place and where and the community or organizations can be involved in letting their voices be heard in relation to this process so staff are going to get back to the community board on that I 'm assuming yes yep there 's just one other on page 151 the land use recovery plane and review we did make a submission on the loop and one of the things that we because the the dist the M the district plane review has to be consistent with the regional development plane and the loop and we could see some issues within the loop that knee to be submitted on so when when the submissions record we made a submission but the problem is we there 's no guarantee that these that the decision on the on the submissions on the alert plan review process is finished so that 's a bit of a frustration as well because we could see that that if we did have any issues with the district plan review and go through that process it 's got to be consistent with the loop we could see that there were some issues with the lip so we made submissions there but we 've still got to go through the district plan review process and it 's just an unfortunate set of circumstances and I don 't know whether this organization can try n move things around or suggest announced an order and council but it 's very very frustrating when you asked to make submissions on top yeah we got complete yeah you got your message thing yep yep that 's okay we give it the first time likely I know that we 're not I know that I 'm not explaining it too late no no no no we understand we understand the issue and but given that a dozen order and council it 's probably and I 'll do got a tricky one right okay and for neighborhood week funding for air for a very fine um communities to pull the neighbors together and and have a bit of a social gathering okay thank you move Jimmy second to Jamie I 'll put that those in favor please say aye those opposed carry to thank you very much

    "text": "and you 're going to jointly to the entire time 11 is that right calling no you 're going to do that right ok welcome Andrea good morning everybody so just three we things just to bring up first one is southern place it 's a street that borders the red zone and ellington quiet workplace at sutton place it borders the the red zone and Ellington and the only access for the residents is through the residential red zone he probably I don 't know you travel through the red zone very often but the roads in the footpaths are in very very poor state they are part of the horizontal infrastructure that is I believe the council 's responsibility the residents are really struggling to maintain quality of life you know just the accessibility to the properties that the footpaths it was okay for a while because they could walk through the red zone but now the red zones been all fenced and you know blockaded off they don 't have that ability or so just fled we 're having a meeting with them on site next week and what we believe there is a couple of other streets that this sort of similar situation applies to we 're streets have sort of been just by where the red zone boundaries of fall under the ended up isolated so the actual access to the street is it 's very they have to go through the red zone Dave could you possibly have a look at it and report back to the in the Munson on second place okay just so that yeah I 'm sorry but the problem is you Jane sorry one of you Thank You Glenn thank you could we also expand it to look at what i call the rib no no seriously the cannery and the board novum the rig green zone interface so this applies both and it 's unusual and only in this board but it applies EG deling tanvir would avondale its mother rip well it is green but it 's weather services are still present for residents to use but not getting a place for tune on them so if we ever sony an emo something that actually laws of the the actual specific problems that people are at want addressed so if there 's certain place if there 's another one as well feel release i think well well get only actual streets in terms of exes we 'll start with certain place Tim 's going to apparently tell us something asian crisis crest sorry Chris do you know that you there and they 're both passing the back to you know teach you to come into the meeting last month we bought paper to lead refugees the red zone in terms of infrastructure within there are different categories and decommissioning some of the unused waste water network etc etc and decision accountable to our south to go back to the community and the community boards to engage with those planets were presented and we next month I color the issues of being right here will be addressed through that okay excellent so at that time you can also address with the community board set in place and any other specific ones that gleam gives you rather than a general area of the city okay thanks very much a where there 's really obvious places that need some immediate attention and I don 't know the details of some place but even so I Drive by Ivan park with people playing sports is there a process that we can actually get some work time just to have a you know not a gold plating of the road but actually just you know actually at least at least at least usable it without people having a walkthrough so that you know palms of us deep can you give all those to Chris like so for example Evan side drive well I 'm raised it repaired so what 's the specific area outside and park I 've inside droid x mean curse road and my numb and gave us road bridge okay so can you address that one as well as their report bed yeah yeah okay but but I just wanted to check though that we did we don 't need to get a hold full report come pay you have the capacity actually go on and do sort of interim that 's what they 're going to meet with the capacity to go on actually put aloe to keep the knocking yes miss oven and things aren 't we description pretty well we 've just put a new toilet and open park and if you go across to you and that coming back to your to feel what pics this community board okay you good with that India yeah yeah okay Ellie really quickly and I don 't know with this is appropriate but I did have a call from someone who lives an S spot that you just mentioned between gay Houston why noni there is a mess of rubbish issue along their set being addressed Jane Jane 's really good on rubbish it 's become a dumping ground mattresses cheers rush even side between Queen gave this road even side drive between gay whose road and why known in right this is our only a dumping grounds is our verbal snacks in salt thank you very much a totally had mostly people when you up if you do that I 've done it three times but he will just put that on 20 yep okay I had 's a long time yeah they have a couple of just sorta and then it sort of same area as the the bus service down Darlington the bus service down you know we went through don 't roll the bus services don 't you yes I think do you monitor space not that it 's a sore point or anything yeah we do here yeah latest anyhow has been to the ball are to the Ellington RA and looking at some future option at ok ok Pauline yeah I 've got a question on page 21 a deputation 2.1 that was my next one is also ok um now they they 're questioning the criteria used to assist those trees yes the themes to be and is this part of the district plan review stage my guess is this is i think around Sierra in the land clearance program will be asked you to program and things they seem to be only assessing trees on the year the tightness in the health of them but not locking it the cultural significance to the community of those trees to the previous don 't know what the creek Turner 's when omari date they very prescient his under trees and so those trees have significant so what did you decide to do about it bring a representative from Syria to speak with them but my question is and it 's good but what are they wanting to do they want him to be able to take trees out or here they identified trees they 're going to take out who you talked about to wet seal their owners Sarah what 's here I seem to I don 't really understand the process of how Sarah decide though there 's trees that appear to be marked as to be saved and then if week later the residents will go and find the trees gone so that 's what I mean like there 's a bit of a time element here actually being taken out if you had concerns about them yeah so um so why are they taking out any trees that are reasonably significant yeah mm-hmm we can 't work out well as it 's one of those situations where tree tech trees get removed in the brief to actually remove them so they sort of its Olivia so it appears and there 's a new beast in subsidies theory moon we as a council right to Syria and ask them to if they are removing three sips they could push pause until the community borders headed conversation was the representative victory a good way forward I 'm just wondering and really I 'm not sure if it 's cheered or what committee is coming I tea cookie trees me teach you that you thought it is a heritage on Dead Sea but no some of them won 't be here to judge and some of them people will have major concerns about but they won 't be listed as here welage items yeah but what I 'm trying to make sure cost of it is that there 's actually not removal and this there is its Denise or something but the trees are removed i don 't see why we 're removing trees near its own for weiss errors so yeah but it 's just to the board level and I through your committee to help the board on this week we 're getting probably ninety percent of our requests to to Sierra to come to the board to call end at the moment really yeah we have not been able to get Sarah okay we age do so would you just like to help them and maybe make it a part of ite that deals with the trees in the red zone cuz I don 't really see why they take them out crimson Isis yeah so fellow work with follow work with you Andrea on that one okay and ending is Suri will elevate it to the infrastructure committee yeah android yeah I think it 's important that we do look at it as a potentially bigger than just the Burwood Pegasus board issue I realized that the Boers Pegasus board is where this has come to light and certainly recognize your interest in it value the work that you 've done but certainly when we get to look to clearance of the red zone in the port hills as well this is exactly the kind of thing that i think there 's a metropolitan aspect or a wider than just your ward issue to this which means that it would be good for the committee at least to have some oversight if not some direct involvement yeah Danny can we um reestablish those meetings we used to have a Sarah in ccd you which have been catered for the last three months yep because next that 's a different issue cuz there general that 's the central city no no it 's not dynamesh dinnae she had come to council she has there was a proposal we were talking to Sarah about trying to get a stay of execution for the demolition of the house and the garden and it 's now all be clear felt so you know it just seems to me that we still need that regular floating head house yeah it 's all going on so yeah um and you know there 's a there 's a wider issue about preserving its not just the trees the trees are really important i agree with no any reason now to be making decisions about choosing significance that should be protected or should at least have a stay until we can work out as a city what the best uses so if we want community so these are cafes or to service the bike trails or the farms or whatever happens in the red zone then actually we need to have a bit of a strategic link with us at age of a building that conditional building and end the social aspects which is important so I know that we just heard that um through Sarah that they achieve I think it was cheap that they actually doing a survey of former red zone residents a wellbeing survey people aware of that it was at the Community Board seminar so they 're actually going and talking to the people that just to get their their feelings about it so i think it is tiny that we raise it but i do think we need to edit governments little talk to Sarah so I remember the submission from Diana was excellent and and I 'm amazed that they 've demolished there yes but I 'm wondering if is that aren 't just trees but if we start with trees and just take it from there I think we 'll be fine yeah yeah okay you good with it clean thanks for key just woke this is making its way through the standing committees could we support Pauline 's idea of asking sarah to put Paul 's I think that sounds or weeds well I 'm assuming that Phil 's going to get in touch with them later this afternoon when we finish the meeting well you know I could be the phone number okay okay okay anything else oh that was ok thank you moved to Dave seeking the green I 'll put that report as a whole those in favor please say aye those opposed carried and your next one on page 31 anything major in there no it 's not moved and seconded day put that those in favor business decisions on our

fine with it well I assume they yes sir oh yeah my move okay Road intersection improvement in widening of Martians road bridge now just briefly this is quite a historical intersection that 's quite a blex fortis like shades of gardens road saw his arms the speed civil Residents Association particular have been pushing for safety measures Atlas an intersection for look well over 10 years that I know of the problem is the intersection is actually offset so sticks and lower in hawkins los tix are offset and Martians being so busy people are actually just taking serious risks the you to get out apart from that it 's actually part of the plan changed 30 consent conditions for priests and so the agreement is that this intersection would be upgraded and the fact that traffic lights will be installed here means that these road improvements that have to be made widening for cycle lanes and consequently the bridge will have to be widened as well so that 's basically the two community boards had we 've had two briefings to joint meetings about this and ask lots of questions about it so it just seems to me that the right time long time coming there 's also NCTA funding of fifty-four percent for this whole project some of that sex you 've been received in advance so it 's not a total costume to count so thanks Pauline so you 'd like to move up I 'll move it yep yep sorry sleep and add another comment to make as well me any seconding that yeah clin see compared to two issues that were raised ones on page 91 that 's now been included as a recommendation and that is that they didn 't seem to be any consistency and the cycle lane carry on for Neptune in cycles so that 's now been included as a continuation another concern that was expressed by some of the community board members was that when staff look at an intersection like this their brief generally is for a certain area around the intersection and no through the beyond it so there 's a measurement within which they consider the intersection but not beyond and there was some criticism of that because it 's it 's almost siloed like you 're looking at an so if you 've got cipher ways for example on the bridge you 're not looking at what happens further down the bridge when it 's outside the intersection so that was taken on board but it might be with others being aware of this as well that there isn 't often a larger strategic look at what happens beyond the intersection and I think that needs to be well done from that we all know that Martians road is carrying a lot of traffic in increasingly so and it probably eventually would have the whole thing with why is that grading yes to a question of we do you stop and start and when do you do it wind how do you afford it but this intersection improvement is going to be a very welcome addition to the end to the community safer the I think a new traffic flow okay phool jaan e Jimmy this was on the is at the intersection I 'd be really surprised if staff ahead not also taken a holistic view of the whole whole Road good enough staff would like to comment was succinct and focused did in fact there would be an objective view of the of the white erosion okay Andrea since you 're sitting in the hot seat you 're free to leave your space security but otherwise you might get questions did you want to answer there so we do take the wider view obviously through the strategic plan and the network operating plans this fits within I guess the 10-year plan or even longer for what we need to do with a rope network this intersection has already been stated is of a major concern is one is happiness within the top hundred but in the country in terms of its safety record or poor safety record with preston 's coming on stream and and they 're currently starting to build in or than access they 've started that last week that means we will get people coming out of Preston subdivision on to lower stakes road if they 're heading north I want to write on Martians road and currently that is a very and it 's a very unsafe maneuver it comes with a lot deep throat two proud to yep Hawkins on the far side that 's a band maneuver because of the safety concerns so this is a very high priority in section so in the design of it we have a addressed future needs that may come about but it 's not seen their needs of this this time in terms of getting cyclists through this intersection cyclic safely that 's been addressed in the design ahead of and beyond the intersection with the future plans there will be a reduction in the through traffic on Martians road so at this time it 's not seen that the cycling outside of the intersection is of a greater concern it is proposed by NZTA to put a parallel route up the North material when they get to build their motorway so that will be a cycle route if you like the longer cycle route from Cairo foil or northern areas into into Belfast as part of the city so we 've provided and designed for a safe movement to cyclists around this intersection which currently doesn 't exist on all sofas pedestrian safety two reserves on either side and so really that the design house has a address though the future proofing that we see may be needed to line up with other it 's in the future but are not necessarily required right now thank you it 's sorry I 've got unis then Jimmy then you can have yo was it directly related to go for it the Appian page 57 when it was brought up at the meeting the very issue that I 've just raised I asked start specifically about the particularly the piece of marshland road at the top of the page heading north you 'll see that what is marked as a proposed curb stops now that area along there I understood was going to be part of the cycle or the area for the cycle cycles and I asked why does that suddenly stop there what happens to the cycles and I don 't mean to contradict what we 've just heard but we were told that the focus for the staff was within the immediate area of that intersection so that doesn 't actually marry the design does just stop and the reason for that we were told is that it is outside of the brief for the redesign of this intersection do you want to comment any further so that I mean in a way that in terms of the brief for this in section is it has yes there is a limit in terms of the extent down each wrote that the design goes but it has provided facilities currently north and south is in section is a reasonably wide Road reserved with provision for cyclists within the sealed carriage way around this in section though we specifically identified safe routes for cyclists so they can go from that wider Road into the intersection into a month lane or a you will see in the resolution it makes it a special purpose lane through the intersection either straight through or turning left or right so while Steve design has the extended beyond the limits of this because obviously we 're constrained by the scope of the LTP funding and the project itself it has I addressed what needs to happen or how we but outside of the extent here north and south there is well there 's not mark cycle lanes their success to be wit with in the sealed carriage will accommodate cyclists okay thank you I 've got yeah Neil in Jamaica so what I don 't understand is we 're building an intersection for all the cars we 're expanding it for the private plane change that for cyclists for you to assume if you 've got people going to new subdivisions you 'd also have a demand for cycling we 're putting an on-road cycle line on a really busy road why why are we thinking about the new guidelines standards that we have in terms of you know the safety aspect and actually doing something because this would seem a really good strictly you could actually have an off road parallel cycle line there would be a much safer I 'll turn so under the major cycleways program this is an identified as one of the motorcycle way roots and the northern route as I say it is is being addressed by nzta as part of their there parallel to the motorway design was currently under designed to be able to enable access from further north areas into Belfast this area here isn 't identified either through the cts-v under the motorcycle waistband as a major cycleways roof that would enable or would provide separate off-road facilities there are other future provisions in the mtef is about five years out for northern connections that may well fall within that Riemann but is not currently but you know just even just for this intersection and approaches is nothing we could do to make it safer for cyclists then what we 're proposing as I say we have provided in the design for safety of cyclists through this intersection so that the cycle lanes lead into the intersection they provided for through the intersection you 'll see in the resolution there 's a couple of there 's four or five of them the recommendations relate to creating a special purpose lane which is specifically for cyclist just the other chris i had was on in terms of the safety do we have a list of the worst intersections in christchurch spoke with them that intersection the safety so there is a national database we all blotter ities right they do it before kiwi wrap which rates the safety hazards within their districts against the National criteria this one under that falls within the top hundred yes we do have a list which shows that the positioning of our various intersections and soul yeah I wish I was just trying to understand if there 's other intersections that are more dangerous than a city that we don 't have funding for we want to how about we just get that it 's very difficult to hear you just by the way and but how about we just get that list available to all councillors I think we 've actually seen that anyway but could you just give that a skein I mean of the ones in Christchurch on its model Christian for me as given that this is thing this is being driven by the plane change daily so origin before general earth and change duty is it possible that we would get the developers who are benefiting from us to significant way given given that distance think cross subsidized across the entire city how much are we getting from the developers were benefiting trinket from this so effectively the gross contar component of these two projects will be put into the developer contributions calculation so by that way the developers of preston 's will be paying their assess contribution through the developer contributions to the growth component of this so that the growth component is basically the the need for additional volume will go into the developer contribution calculation which sits in the DL TV and thus in that way rather than being specific to Preston subdivision because this growth elsewhere in this area that 's affecting this intersection not just Preston subdivision and so in a way all of those developers that will impact this will contribute towards it take because it is Elm atlas thank you it 's not ever since that would it be possible in future is part of these reports to actually get to the foster the development of DCs so we actually see um is that even possible to do that because it 's would contained within the the LTP is put into the calculation so it is quite difficult to identify all its phases what a particular developer is contributing to that particular project because each policy that behave as part of a healthy penis has a schedule of all the different projects so in the same way that we would be told in ZT are contributing 50 seems why don 't you just get a copy of that and rather than having to put it on each report it 's gonna drive people nuts it 's too much detail at least unless this a real appetite with no Jimmy my questions whether this project is one of the council 995 you know the almost project will be within the capital program preview or not and also has a quite cheery some of the kind of the program to presenter to the council meeting sample named not yet hasta the criteria I guess every project at the 995 are part of that review and this one though is a effectively a legal requirement on council by virtue of the plan change 30 decision through the city plan and it is also one of the highest priorities early in our LTP is program both of the projects the bridge renewal and the intersection upgrade are in this financial year next year next financial year as part of the LTP and I I believe they are the the highest priority ones of the highest priority that we need to do in the coming two to three years and as such as a site there there is a driver to doing this because Preston subdivision will be opening that intersection on to low sticks road or will estimate within the next 12 months and we will get the traffic trying to get out of this intersection with the with the resulting concerns about safety okay thank you is there any debate on the subject before I put it I 'd clean hips a brief debate and support and I put a hat on is a personal road user of this intersection in the past as a cyclist it is lethal to get across from orphans to lower sticks if you 're doing the Brooklyn 's loop I first spotted it in the LTP I thought all good this could go towards a certain other bridge but it doesn 't quite work like that and I think that that other bridge may well happen this is a recollection is the fourth most dangerous intersection in Christchurch the Martians wrote itself in terms of capacity for cyclists a lot of cyclists use it as the final League of the coast to coast route now there 's plenty of width in that coming south but as with all roads I mean you have to watch yourself the whole time so I would very much like to support this project going ahead it does have to happen there is a real safety issue there it 's lethal so yeah I usually you do please support okay Thank You Glenn yeah anything Dave I won 't be supporting this I think we 're going through a capital review and that 's timely the the issue for me this is the cost of urban sprawl and you know it 's any fashion urban sprawl is inefficient it costs more and the people a fraction of the cost of putting in the infrastructure so every time we spend money rates rates into doing these projects to encourage green fields development we are creating a more unsustainable city because we 're not getting consolidation or that urban form and in fact in Christchurch now the issue we have is that some of the roads that are really badly damaged from the earthquake aren 't going to be folks for 30 years so this is a trade-off that we have to make as councillors over providing a level quality service for growth in our city vs. areas that have been hardest by the earthquake not having the budget to do there appears that we need to do in a timely fashion to bring it up to the normal level of standard so I support us taking a strategic approach to fixing dangerous intersections and we 've heard the comment that well this is in the top 4 well actually I couldn 't see in the report actually where it fits in terms of the rankings I think it 's really important that as part capital asked for an annual list of the worst intersections in our city for cyclists and and n for traffic and we 've actually asked for a lust so that we can address those and I have no problem using that that process but IM concerned that we are increasingly spending huge amounts of money on growth in our city at a time when we can 't afford it because we can 't afford to fix the broken infrastructure we have in other parts that my personal view should be a greater priority ok thank you Dave dim point thank you look I will support this motion I went out at North yesterday and traffic was backed up virtually to a standstill for almost kaiapoi this is a not only a sort of a safety improvement for traffic exiting spin spark that it 's also facilitating better flows along Mason 's rate as well we have had some concerns expressed about cyclists safety along Martians road and I have recollections of being a young high school student biking along mouseland 's road to Shirley boys high every day from north of kids doing that at the moment but I take some comfort in the fact that we are progressing with the northern arterial and the cycleway will be built as part of that as well which will provide a safer cycle route for those that are cycling north and the reduction of traffic on Martin 's road with the northern arterial will again make cycling 's cycle safety I think a little bit on Marcy 's road this is a particularly vulnerable corner as Glenn has indicated and it does rate rather highly in the accident statistics for the city so I think on those points of all concluding so yes I will support the motion before us today thanks Pauline thank you yeah look I don 't think this is necessary totally related to urban sprawl and in some ways it could be a godsend to us that it was a provision of plan change duty because it has possibly accelerated the snare program as I said before this has been only the list of dangerous and sections for many many years and spent several residents association of lobbied the because it 's been such a dangerous intersection it 's also don 't forget it 's the key intersection for people getting out to the suspense apart camping ground in the summer time out in and it puts a lot of strain on this as well we 've also got the issue of a lot of traffic coming through from the y me a key as well because everybody 's moved out so um you know I think Preston 's is here now that 's provided housing we 've got to go with it we can 't just say well Preston 's droves us I say it didn 't drive this completely it might have added to it but there 's other reasons for it if you look at all the market gardens down down Martians road and the terrific people accessing those VG places not just on weekends but during the week it 's actually getting bigger and bigger and bigger so in my view this is going to be a very very welcome improvement in the center section and particularly around a cycleway safety and think spleen is information there because you can see just from the plan it 's going to be much much much better for cyclists as a horrific intersection and I really look forward to the side dude hope everyone supports us right now q okay I 'm going to put it this is anything that 's not see it I 'll put it those in favor please say aye those opposed carried okay moving on to item 12 thank you very much guys and things for my marry Isabel here I go welcome come on _"

shopping can be bent closure and we have received replies i 'm not sure i know that council roche both to post being a Kiwibank end aids it i don 't know if you 've had replies or not they would quite like to see those if you have but we have replies and the board at their last meeting decided actually the double in particularly satisfactory so we are right and back you 've had to reply we 've had a reply and we 're writing back to they reply but I say basically that they 're still going ahead and that they there are other branches and they 're going with the customers are but we don 't believe that they are following the code of social responsibility so we 're going to ask them about it okay thank you anything else in plat be not from that those in favor say aye those opposed carried and the next one on page 129 no okay moved Paul seeking to Jionni oh it sure this point I 'd quite like to echo that I 'm like the comments from andrew from field Pegasus earlier as well about the redesign there 's issues that have come up with that board as well I 've the infrastructure and the trees into those kinds that are boards discussed as well yeah well Prince battalion red zone to it 's often forgotten and and on this the third one from the 16 sorry I 'll just put a bit of pass it yep i 'll put it move again yeah 129 yeah to bring two couches tension the dictation 2.1 and I know one of our levels of service that we 're not meeting is around communities participating volunteering I think there 's some words and their run numbers but actually if you look at these projects the child 's birth weight and wildlife reserve and mccormick stay in particular it 's extraordinary work that a small group of people are doing on the thousands of people you actually have thousands of hours going and to enhancing these communities and often with we discussed doing things in a different way actually I just want to draw your attention to something that doesn 't need to be done a different way it 's actually working really well and we should actually congratulate and commend our council staff who work with these groups for the huge success that they are having and making a difference and if you saw the presentation mmm pictures of Charles worth reserved before this group started there and after and then planting 100,000 tree it 's pretty extraordinary so I don 't Sarah was just add anymore to where yeah it 's some similar to the next point they have done an amazing week they 've now moved on from the Charles with area to mccormick 's pay and but it is it 's a really good model of what is already happening and what can be rolled out into other areas as well and just on not that subject but the related one the infrastructure committee is going to so making sure that the whole project which has actually got some budget to clean up the hid kit is coordinated and made visible so that people are aware that would be of what 's going on there are some real concerns about the river this should be some real cousin consider about the river and then we we have made some actual budgetary allocation to do something about the river as well so in order to pull it all together because it 's it goes to the zone committee it goes to the whole raft of Europe 's it 's going to come each month to folks committee that 's great okay the reporters ahold we 've got a mover and second it 's Cena day yep okay I 'll put that those in favor please say aye those opposed carried um and okay was it the and just on his last one and there was another group who had been doing amazing work already and it 's the the Friends of immense victory gardens as mentioned and that have elected members that after a alcohol being for the last meeting but they 've them in just a few days time they will have their 25th anniversary of starting up as Edmonds Victory Gardens yeah I mean friends of and John Hoskins has been cheer for the entire time this end that group go along every weekend and doing weeding in maintenance in those Gardens which is work now the council don 't have to do it 's an excellent model of what the community can do and will be great to see that model rolled out in other areas i know that there 's some talk now I 've doing something similar for victoria 's square maybe in friends of victoria square so that they have a really key stakeholder group and starting that way um also happening in other wards for example there 's a group in burwood Pegasus ward who have basically adopted Rafferty domain yeah and are doing a mess of butterfly planting but not planting butterflies but planting trees are planted plants they attract butterflies and it 's just a group of residents sexually who here alongside and if any group there 's also basically adopt a park yeah we have very very open to that is there a formal structure set up before they eat yeah and there 's not a formal structure and that 's happening anyway oh they 're so I 'm just wondering foods that the end is a structure that currently friends use with the friends of evenings with regard news contact the green spaces a well actually no it 's on the stretcher might be got no so what foo do you contact a proper like yes how you guys okay process some process that the groups can go through to be able to work in with council staff on there who do you contact to adopt a park or even foster one yeah that 's right until I tweaked underway yeah right cool thank you anything else no that not your report is moved by Paul seconded by yanni and i 'll put that those in favor please say aye those hosts thanks very much indeed thank you very much Mike _"

Galland and the gallery there though too but I 'm surprised just for the benefit of four other members that five years later after the youth after the earthquake that we haven 't had more of this because it 's a it 's a tricky situation which is actually inevitable and I think people have just borne the brunt of it so people repairing houses contractors there for a long time there 's no place on site so unfortunately there are parking their house built are ending up being ticketed and these contractors heavily wind streams full of tickets whether they wear them themselves have been passed them on to the homeowners don 't know but it is problematic and I 'm sure in something like this there is a problem there 's an issue and I 'm sure there 's a really pragmatic way to solve it so we need to see that you to your committee Phil and we 'll find a way that we can say in these businesses unusual times there 's got to be a sensible way just to say get the job done but we 're not there to penalize you because the sort of pp1 20s and the turnover for shops nearby it wasn 't intended to stop people rebuilding their homes and getting on with your lives so I 'll leave it with you guys but hopefully we can get a pretty elegant solution to this and move on quickly yep temple in the center city especially when we were doing events and other things you can go to the council if I like rental on a subtly put over the meters or whatever and you 've got a the like so I 'm sure along those lines are somethings that process somewhere in this organization that we can adopt for this Christian sure what does this envisage to be a temporary state or something that would just go on I don 't know let 's apply to somebody who was actually building a new house anyway whether it was youth quite a few or not oh yes we want it for the long turns you 're not shooting it 's just been highlighted as a result of the earthquake rebuild but I think this is gonna come up forever so if we have a pre-med away forward or one of Tim 's socks emotions looking at like a dress turn off your mind well I mean this is gonna be in a Charmin we 've got issues earlier and Eddington and other areas in the city so if we can come up through report to Phil 's community with regards to a way forward for the city as a whole then we 've little journal it 's certainly not just you know no it 's not start actively good okay so we 've got that recommendation everybody fine with it okay i 'll put that those in favor please say aye those opposed Kerry happy anything in it well no I think it is pretty self-explanatory and we have got huge quarrying issues out an autist and it keeps keeps coming back to us that trap movements the dust the water we 're giving a lot of complaints from residents it has a huge issued for our board and Brigida McGraw because absolutely right ok that the reporters are all be adopted that was moved by Jamie signify read we 'll put that those in favor please say aye those opposed carried and the next one on page 105 moved a rare second of Jamie Bell anything no everything 's funding that okay i 'll put that those in favor please say aye those opposed carried thanks very much indeed Bell thank you _"

were going to have a council meeting in Port lady at the mirai and whether that is something that you think would still be useful I think it 'd be great to have a council meeting a portly V at the mirai I wouldn 't want it to be the meeting where that particular issue was considered and I think it 's quite important that you don 't make that hit on fri but be seen to be community for over there next community board meeting like wolf or next I mean we could just lets me hanging around for a long time I don 't_''_48.41 I don 't know if I 'm for council meeting we can sort that it 's just that it was raised at it I 'm taller minutes or something ok action 30 funicular Nick 's community board meeting council council so I can you know it for the one well if it 's just it has been hanging out for a life okay I suggest you do it during the swimming season excellent idea okay right moved and seconded i 'll put the reports hold those in favor please say aye those opposed carried thank you thanks very much indeed for us spread and Heath kit Oh welcome for thank you good morning everyone and we just have so this is on page 15 we have one part a that the board decided to recommend that the council approved the installation of signs to indicate the location of developed Springs and Christchurch both road signs to provide directions from major different routes as well as road signs at the location and members Carolyn Potter and Melanie coca have been on a bit of a tour around around the city with with somebody who 's associated with De Luca to have a look at Springs and there 's one particular example that stands out as a redwood springs and papanui we 're in the middle of a park is beautiful this beautiful spring that 's got seats and things around and that 's the motivation behind this is to let people know where Springs have been developed and allow you know enhanced for people to know that this so that they can enjoy them thank you and did you so did you want to move that this request be referred to infrastructure committee the simplest way and I think there are some other measures to like example that if we make sure that there 's an investigation of this because there are some potential costs of course discussions so there 's additional aspects to what the board recommended that I 'm sure that the structure committee will look at so fellas moving that this request be referred to ite for consideration thanks seconded by Paul thanks for sorry okay you need discussion on it if not I 'll put there a second did it was seconded by our school yep clean just not on meet specific point load was okay well let 's skip on this 15 can I put that those in favor please say aye those opposed and carried kid oh thank you it was just on a seeking a constituent rather was seeking information over the hail database it 's held by he can and whether he can would actually expand on it that it 's something I thought it as an option for a rental register so that database already exists but could we put another shop front or me for what for what a rental region it 's quite a wee way from that petition well actually I think it 's closest but it 's a route it 's a really good try and I admire it inaudible sing no tell you what look me I tell you what when you have we talked to the who 's the housing Commissioner it again other isn 't members to e Cain and see what the abuser and then feel free to report it back through any of any committee chief committee or your housing task force you okay so you 're gonna investigate it come bacon see okay go try and do it okay if I made wrist it no isn 't really not on that but we do not know not that the actual I so that the motivation of this is that there is you know there are a lot of people got these letters saying they have contaminated land and they not don 't necessarily have the five thousand dollars to check if it is actually contaminated and so they what we would like is that because if you see for rebills we 'll be testing it land we 'd like to make that that information be made available so that people know the chances of you know that how likely it is that their land is contaminated so it be made available to landowners okay um anything else for if not i 'll put the report as a whole Oh secondly yeah just the ad we also would like he can to consider the establishment of advisory advocacy and legal services for residents with those properties because people really don 't know what to do or where to go I think it would be excellent if the council would support something like that so you 've written to them we have risen to the municate so why don 't import bait next in the next month on the replies you got yeah right I was ahead of my time no looking at paragraph alright so it 's a problem it 's an ongoing problem no but seriously though there was no no no no we 're good we 're good you 're going to take it up with them that 's good okay i 'll put the report of the whole those

weekend we 've had I think you should do that crash it 's been superb and can I just think you think the team that actually helped us along the way whether it was silicon in international relations or whether it was the man who was collecting the rubbish whoever it was it made it a very successful weekend and if you look at the press if you look at Tom television New Zealand where we 're all over the place and the community really enjoyed themselves and joined in of course will be a few of those there that don 't like the impact of all of this also special as well because we had only on the sunday there was a celebration around the church the church was 150 years so he had the high dignitaries we had the Bishop of Christchurch so we don 't often see these good dignitaries in Christchurch I mean and sorry in a Curragh but the amazing thing about the whole weekend was that it was a relationship between the French and the Mary and our local Runanga it was just superb the the French ambassador really stepped up to the mark and spoke about Mary relationships and the French relationships with the rest of you sit on the buying of Barker 's and she mentioned a few other things and the rugby match of course but it really made the day and then on the Sunday everybody set out on the green so we 've had a wonderful weekend for 175 so let 's move forward and look what the next year 's may bring but there are a couple of other things that are FM minutes if we go back to the minutes here and look at our minutes and we talk about a shower on the beach we talked about over further about French farm public toilets and water supply for that banks peninsula is very water short so we will continue having issues but we had a wonderful occasion of the opening of the 11 11 million dollar water supply for a Corral last Thursday where Becca came over and took us up around the plant we had a great afternoon a great opportunity to network with some of our community and Becca the fine team fulton hogan hawkins and those that have been involved that 's construction so that was very much welcome so we hope to have another one what that will organize with the zone committee and that hope feeder will see a few of you counselors along to see what what there is an acura it 's quite inspirational watching the pipes run from the the three or there 's five intakes into that water supply and how they work overtime so that was amazing the third thing that I want to talk about is the freedom camping by law and the opportunity in our place with you sitting around our table so thank you to the hearings panel that came over to be with us and our community really appreciated the way that was carried out presented with us as a community not often do you come over and we all sit around the table that we 've got a new COO with us the resonance of the community and those others that are very interested in what 's going on it was an innovative way of doing it it was very worthwhile of course there 'll be some that think they didn 't have their five minutes in the Sun but the commissioners gave or the hearings panel gave others that were the opportunities to catch up with them if they hadn 't been heard so out of that I hope that we have a very positive freedom camping line camping by law coming through it is a difficult a difficult issue to deal with and I hope that they 've got some ideas coming through but look we do really really think people coming to a Corral and on our forever to you you know I would take every opportunity but but now I won 't so those were just a couple of things that I had out of our minutes and a Corral will continue to have water restrictions on over the holiday season we haven 't_''_272.84 resolved the water quality issue those I mean we 've resolved the water quality issue but we haven 't resolved the water quantity so it will continue for a long period of time and we need to educate out our communities how to do it differently thanks very much indeed parents always a pleasure some questions David yeah it 's a question I just like to pin to reinforce the weekend and thank you can feel your comments about council staff and their participation I was fortunate to be there on Saturday and also like to compliment Andrew for his role in representing them here spoke both in Maori and in French it was very well received and the whole day was it was an absolute delight to be there and again thank you to your comments regarding the freedom camping it a slightly different process of hearing people and I think for my observation certainly I got the impression that most of the people that had come to the hearing went away feeling that they 've been well heard and had the great opportunity to get their point of view across and we 've quite pleased with the outcomes from the day so yeah I 've got a cup of quite pleasant days in a Curragh and the last week and certainly been a lot for being overly thank you oh thank you yani you think I 'll just endorse the appreciation that was made around the people that were involved in that Corral French fest and the local community as well as the council just just wanted to pick up though on the peep the BB meets land in the Icarus service center and I don 't know if that 's any of this related to the health club but I know previously you 've come to council talking about the excitement of having the joint partnership with a new health hub and it 's we haven 't heard much 's still some sort of consultation possibly around the BP meets the inside and yeah so can you just maybe just give us a brief update on where things are at the other the other just question related to that is has your board been briefed on our land disposal process of our superfast land yes we have we had there in relation to that question we had a briefing yesterday from and dismiss than the proper development team regarding that about the process how that will be worked through and we had the opportunity for input and we 'll be looking forward to making some decisions down the track we need time around it to think about it when we 're looking at a surplus land that 's not being required but of course it provides some challenges in regards to the banks peninsula meet site it is no longer being looked at this stage with in regards to the echo health hub the echo health hub has some issues and we 're dealing with those but it looks as over the health hub will be back on on be built at the stage we 've we 've got a few challenges on our hand but I can assure you that we 're working very closely with the cdhb and they our ad evering to ensure that we get what we want so we 're where we work will commit but the banks peninsula meet site is just still sitting there as a site but we have a community that 's very interested in the use of that site and what might happen to it and we will have to go through a process whenever any decision has made that but it 's just sitting sitting there quietly at the moment the service center while it 's on its way of repairs and we 've got a briefing next month i think that 's coming up that will tell us about progress on that particular building okay thank you and so we 've only got part B&C items moved Andrew seconded Yanni put them those in favor please say aye those opposed carried and thank you very much indeed thank you thank you all you guys and little timeout _"

just move before we go do the public participation that the resolution supplementary reports on page 4 49 be added resolution number 35 which relates to the northern relief sewer project to discuss that today as well page 4 49 moved for lean seeking to Jamie I 'll put that those in favor please say aye that brings us to the Vox pops or open mic and we have Genevieve fat in as bad welcome just so you know what happens with it petition same as open 15 minutes right just getting some clues the clue is this okay yeah and can you hear me is this thus okay with microphone yes our sound systems gone so we 're on these Thanks yep okay mm well good morning councillors and deputy mayor and council staff thanks very much for this opportunity to talk today I 'm gender spar representing it 's our future Christchurch opposition against the TPP and marches and rallies all over the country it 's our future Christchurch launched this campaign to declare Christchurch a TPP free zone on that August fifteenth rally and there were three and a half thousand Christchurch people marching who queued in the pouring rain to sign this petition hints it looks a little bit bedraggled I 'm duty-bound to present the petition to you however events have overtaken us with the 12 TPP nation 's reaching a tentative agreement and Atlanta last Monday the text will be publicly released now most likely by the end of October and ill be reviewed and considered by each of the 12 nations governments so over a year ago the Christchurch City Council unanimously adopted the TPP policy solution to safeguard council and constituents interests in the TPP negotiations 11 other councils have also adopted this resolution with minimal amendments the 12 points in the resolution therefore are the most obvious blueprint from which to assess the TPP against the public interest it is the only publicly available viewpoint of public interest and it has substantial support from the that the council resolved to review the text of the trans-pacific partnership against the TPP policy solution and to deliver a report assessing whether the policy solution has been upheld and our interests protected we further requests that the ccc demands central government consults with local government prior to any further action being taken that compromises the TPP policy solution that we all agree on our main reasons for requesting you take the section are to maintain some democracy democratic process and good faith with the public when huge decisions like this are taken so the recent high court decision that Minister grosser has acted unlawfully under the OIA is just yet another example of how democracy has been sidelined in the process of the TPP the second reason is isds councils and new zealand government are at risk from demands for compensation by foreign corporations under the investor state dispute settlement mechanism in question is why do these corporations need this level of protection insurance against government regulations affecting business is available for purchase so I SDS effectively means taxpayers are underwriting big corporations even though is Diaz cases in the interests of those same taxpayers this is a Roth and the third reason is climate change Christchurch City Council has taken climate change seriously and is clearly placed it within the remit of local government and this is great so we need to consider why in a so-called 21st century agreement would climate change not have been carved out we know that fossil fuel companies use of isds has been consistently among the most aggressive and rapacious of all of the industries it is a nonsense to be planning for the consequences of climate change while simultaneously encouraging the causes Naomi Klein makes this precise point in this changes everything we do not dispute the need for New Zealand to trade but what has been missin aimed free trade promotes monopolistic industries including those that are destroying the environment forcing wages down and growing massive piles of waste or which become local government problems and we haven 't even got a good dairy deal out of this so these people are asking for some real answers before we commit to a deal so once again our sincere thanks just for the people in the audience you 're not supposed to clear I couldn 't tell you that now thank you very much indeed gene just because and there 's nobody else speaking you can we can have a couple of questions that people want if there are any if there 's not i 'm not sure in terms of petitions we 're that petition would go strategy and finance or cheered okay we 'll find out with it petition goes and it will go there and and do you want to leave your speech notes behind as well so I 've actually emailed them all okay you in the middle of the night so I don 't expect any a few days _"

    "text": "next item on the agenda is the housing management board updates the report be received so is moved by Vicki Burke and seconded by Glenn lovingston okay just so very briefly and obviously the house management board has done a huge amount of work on this and has been faced I think with two major challenges one to make the council 's social housing unit financially sustainable and secondly to make the proposed a chip community housing provider and also financially sustainable and at the same time to provide a really good standard for tenants and to ensure that we can deliver additional housing both within the council 's levels of service and additional beyond that and the process has been much longer than we would have anticipated but I think we 've actually come up with a really good solution and you 'll see that there is a supplemental report and public excluded as well which gives you all the numbers on how this works and and the fact that it does work which I find the most reassuring of the work that 's been going on so councillors staff time a huge amount of staff time from Mary and Carolyn and many others as well as some very good advice from deloitte 's and Ben from and I 'm going to get the legal firm wrong anderson lloyd and which has gotten us to the point where we are now meeting with the potential trustees of the check except for one who 's currently oversees could I acknowledge of the keys work and that 's turned out at my colleagues and all the staff this has been a big piece of work and I think we can safely say that you know social housing is not going down the drain there is a plan and that the financial aspect of the plan is based on conservative projections so I I feel happy with that I think sometimes when we have feisty fate it comes about because of a leg and information some of us that at one place for that others at another so we might want to be that in mind when we come to the PX parts of the meeting bladensburg yep all and then Andrew and just catch you later probably one sentence we there is we cannot do nothing this is not a do-nothing situation we have to do something and this is the work of the housing management board to do that something needs to be done yep Andrew and then Ali yeah I 'd like to echo the comments that have been made by I other councillors and certainly a lot of work has gone into this I 'd recognize the contributions that Vicki 's made by putting this idea together in the beginning and getting the ball rolling the other members of the housing management board who pretended a large number of meetings often quite early in the morning and often meetings involving quite technical reports and a lot of financial information and need to to get a lot of matters on the same table at the same time and that really has been one of the challenges with this I 'd also like to annoy the amazing amount of work that 's been done by staff in terms of gathering that information take together in a way that is easily board and the external members who will form part of the community housing provider but just understanding this getting our heads around it has been quite a challenge because of the quantity and the technical nature of the information but where we 've ended up is with a situation that sees the house fund become financially sustainable which is an achievement in itself and we 've arrived at a point where we can now see for a long period into the future some good social and economic outcomes for the provision of social housing in Christchurch and that 's an achievement that must not be underestimated I 'm Ellie question hmm page for six nights of the house of management board update all the eighth of set timber and it does relate to something I think is in PX but it 's it 's just the update the most recent update at the end of the pits report there 's just some information in this update the 8 sep tember that isn 't consistent with the information in the 22nd of sep tember housing medical border can we deal with for a reason yes but if we approve this it 's contrary to what is in the 22nd September 's okay we 're only receiving it so receiving it is not acknowledging it as being correct we could deal with that on p okay yeah all right so i have a motion oh sorry breathe in item two point four it says he agree that 50 million of the 50 million dollars the council has agreed to put into the community housing provider 45 million will be by way of a loan and five million has equity I was under the impression we were transferring land was that something different so the resolution of the council is that we would transfer to the community housing provider 50 million from the current ring-fenced social housing so 50 million cash no not cash no no case 50 million what 50 million of land and other assets that 's currently within social housing the point of the 45 million being by way of potential loan is that all along this pathway recognizing that everything in social housing can change including the IRS or is possible that can possibly change what we 've tried to do is create as you do when you 're setting something up new all of the possible things that could go wrong and plan for them so all along the way we 've left gates so for example if because this is a charitable trust effort was wound up then the 50 million dollars worth of assets which would have been built additional social housing would go back to charitable purposes which doesn 't include the council because the council 's putting in the 50 million dollars worth of land and other assets from the social housing portfolio in the event that anything happens and 5 8 10 years time 15 years time the equity that the council has put in would be returned to the council so that 's the point of making it a loan that 's repayable only in the event that it gets wound up so it 's just ridiculous it 'll make sense so you 're transferring the land but you 're yes Bob Antonio a game against the learn don 't know so in the event that anything happens to the trust and it is required under the charities aid to redistribute any profits that it got with any assets that it has which may be sizeable that the council gets back what it 's put in so that the council 's interest is protected at every possible step we 're not putting the cash there is no cash you know i think that the wording about 50 million dollars it should have said that the 50 million dollars worth of assets that it 's a grade value will be protected by way of being alone the thing I think that this is the this is the resolution that the housing board passed in relation to how the lease agreement is going to be written up so I think that your point can be resolved in the and the way that actual lease agreement eventually weird it there are two components one is the lease agreement and the other is the transfer of some assets from the housing portfolio land where possible but because there may not be 50 million dollars worth of aimed at protecting that council value of investment into the chip so the late answer Luka allegation have we delegated I know we 've delegated the decision making but have we delegated the you know if you were to go outside what we understood we haven 't delicately women delegated the ability of you to change the 50 million dollar with the Dead Sea to the 50 mm oh no no but so if a weird commission would have to come back accounts not release it by the five million remained as equity so that 's cash I mean maybe this needs to it so it 's the wording of the lease that probably needs to reflect her I mean I think this is a rigid sort of a slightly immature way of writing what 's trying to protect by way of making it alone rather than making it a an equity investment and the and the originally it was all just going straight into the chip right so the 50 million of assets was going straight into the church it was a transfer and this is an additional protection a charitable trust such that when it winds up because we couldn 't give that back to the council in that event this allows for the return of that value of the asset that is transferred if we did it with a whole 50 million it gives the chip no bank balance to in order to be able to go and do mortgages or whatever so it 's actually an additional protection for the council well only needs more well the council resolution is actually to transfer full stop fifty million dollars worth of assets from this social housing fund this is the chip or their housing management board being very conservative with the council 's assets and making sure that the value of those assets comes back in the event that the chip is ever wound up I think that the intention is clear from that but the wording probably as a low but the wording is actually would legally by there and people in the documents this is sorry this is just our report yet but just won 't be the wording of the lease agreement itself it to actually agree to do sample error typo in the bullet point above that 12.4 the food court went down and aside the brackets approximately 2 DV 11 million dollars a year get report on point 1 minus the 3.1 is that how you get sorry before what number you 're on pulling so it 's page 46 92.5 point on last line inside the brackets sorry and yep sorry the eventual incomes 14 points 1 minus the main gear success it doesn 't refer to that so it 's not connect that today no it 's not much that should be different paragraph sorry the cat the council and catches the benefit of the cheaper operating model of the chip there is a sizable cost and being in this building and in using our IT system and this means that chip and the council both capture that benefit okay and it 's a one-point million it 's about a million dollars e benefit and it 's not connected to the other to get bigger sorry thank you all right ray waddell energy Jimmy saw item 2.5 the viability of guarantees do we have around that like all government policy there is no lifetime guarantee that comes with them and the modeling that you 'll see later has been done on a five percent only uptake of IRS each year and you 'll see that and the public excluded and it 's a very conservative figure given that our usual turnover of tenants is around eleven to twelve percent per animal so it 's been done by Deloitte it 's very conservative modeling and it doesn 't take into account any potential other benefits that the chip will also capture all right Jimmy regarding to legal otherwise 202 on 84 69 the fourth bullet point enable accessibility for partners to a CD from the community housing provider they have any return how many years those panels it 's kind of Camilla memory and there 's an initial term for the community housing provider for the lease and struggling i think it 's 10 5 10 and all in and and then there is capacity arial i think annually for each any partner to it set so that also responds to of government allows the council to pick up the IRS the council can determine that it wants to bring the cancer with social housing back in terms of tenancy management because remember it 's still owning all the social housing that it 's leasing and so what we 've tried to do is make sure as you normally do when you 're sitting up in your company that you anticipate all of this sort of prenuptial agreements and and do them at the time when there is no enmity involved in the one pardon or a seeker whether the other party look enjoy or not one partner yet other partners can exit yes there is capacity for that and this capacity for the council to exit so we 've tried to make this as flexible as possible for the castle and while giving the chip the capacity to become financially viable for itself in for the council okay thank you umm ali when the trustees have actually probably at the next meeting I would think what that this has actually been delegated at a previous council meeting to the housing thinking sit phir meri yeah yeah I 'm getting a nod all right okay i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye as opposed who know that 's carried the

seconder for it Andrew Turner so questions i know that some hey oh right you know i know that some of the council has had some questions for you i don 't know if you want to give just a very brief overview of it if that 's helpful absolutely so this bus marks the end of the first stage of a of our resilience strategy for for greater Christchurch and a way of thinking about it a very wide not particularly deep look at the stage and to some of the resilience challenges and opportunities that that are facing us the next stage is more about a deeper dive and to our what our stakeholders that we 've spoken to have seen as as our to me as as a resume its challenge focus areas so those those focus areas for greater Christchurch participate of participates in the decisions that affect them how do we are securing a prosperous future what 's required to foster innovation in a trend new people and ideas too great a Christchurch the third focus area understanding and responding to future challenges how do we ensure communities that better prepared for whatever the future brings in the fourth focus area connected neighborhoods and communities what more should we be doing to ensure communities are healthy affordable and safe underpinning these focus areas are questions key questions which I driven by a number of themes themes that came through focus here workshops and discussions and surveys and the analysis housing affordability the role of innovation the role of insurance urban form learning a lesson sprayer and securing the future for the east so a number of underlying themes number of key questions to be answered in the second stage of the strategy so it 's probably enough of an overview every to answer any questions yep Ellie thank you got folk curses or foci okay oh um 448 focus area for yep um I would really like lettuce I 'd like have I mean I 've suggested just the this area includes looking at the nature and extent of housing lead and greater Christchurch the learning and implications of earthquake effects across the whole city but particularly in the eastern Christchurch because there were exceptions and it was her particularly hard but there you know I think in the in the vein of inclusiveness and to acknowledge the variety of experiences across the city depending on socio economic demographic age you know I know some elderly and fen Dalton for example have had huge issues dealing with some of the things that they 've got to deal with four completely different reasons than people and sin Albans Richmond release so I 'd like to see a bit more of a citywide acknowledgement in that if that 's possible that is entirely possible we can make a change and the words it 's a suggestion as a solution to scale I don 't know how does feel good ya know if that 's good yep I 'm pulling yeah thanks Mike also a number for the difference between neighborhoods in communities communities city that 's right so communities can be communities of interest identity and geography as well and neighborhoods we think tend to think more residential that level neighborhood but actually it could also be business neighborhoods as well but it 's meant to sort of highlight the difference between communities of interest identity and geography geography all those interesting side never actually about breaking the weed community up into that those two things before or nothing that 's really helpful yeah thank you right um Yanni and then Phil having nothing in hearing the deputation this morning from the youth council you have the youth voices and and when I look at the kind of initial engagement it 's very much the current traditional status quo decision makers so I 'm really interested in understanding as we go forward with us how the people that haven 't had a voice in to the initial for four areas of focus can never ever boards is we 're point together the terms of reference now for the focus area working groups and so maybe answer one of council on James 's questions observations from our strategic partners around this project so far has been it looks very still much like council there 's a willingness to buy a strategic partners to take part and to go wider as we 're establishing working groups that will have broader representation and in terms of reference will will go beyond the stakeholders that that we 've we 've spoken to so far but one of the one of the cautionary notes is I think we need to make sure that engagement with this doesn 't cut across some really really important other important engage these that are happening across Greater Christchurch at this time and it 's from in particular around the UDS and transition and a whole lot of other things so the conversations have to we have to really really think carefully and strategically how we do that so people don 't get confused about where this is sitting so is the answer is yes we will talk to talk to what to wider groups but we 're going to be very careful about how we do then just had a second question people particularly if you think of places like jolly strange or other areas you know what difference will this make and what those people are going through what in real terms is the impact of doing this on those communities that are struggling and and you know ended and i guess the children who we know through the education system are really finding it difficult that is something that will be answered in the second stage of the inquiry one of the benefits of joining the network is learning from from other cities that are also in the network but also leveraging the resources of the 100 RC rockefeller philanthropic organization that can help us answer some other questions that we are answering so we can 't put our finger on just exactly what it is eat until we partner up more closely with the network and then delve into the reason to the into the inquiry and I would anticipate the strategy itself the final strategy would want to answer that question is it possible um and it was just reference to a young woman who 's just won award for esa calling for greater eek equal wealth creation which talks about learning and education and it just seemed to me that in those four areas one of the gaps as that learning and education so how would we you know if you think about what 's happening with that schools if you think about what 's happening with our children and with inequality is there a way that we can we can include something like a bit more around there and at what stage do we provide that input we can look at the terms of reference that we 're establishing for the working groups now I think we 're also aware that this competition needs to be broader now with possibly with more community board chair and community group and put so we we could probably include that in the terms of reference for the working groups and Pauline and then Glenn and Paul okay are clean and then Paul thank you and thank you Mike and I have read this report and reflected on us a lot my question is about Candice and in the unfolding for us and our money i 'll just talk about the government 's here it 's a little bit similar to that political filter question i asked before but as a kind of order of their own not only decision making but the way we conveyed decisions and what i want to hone in on let 's take for instance the natural hazards chapter whereby where i 'm up to at the moment is we may have done the right thing we had to actually do the right in notifying threats to communities but the process itself i think has become a threat so we inadvertently we notified them placing threats but that in itself became that say huh and I think it has started to undermine that which we 're actually seeking to build which is resilience so is can this also act as an audit for you see council itself you saw yes okay no I would query whether auditors the right word yeah I was trying to think of um you know the measure or yep something yet yet so getting a community understanding and responding to communities as a key key aspect of of that particular focus area and I think that 's one of the challenges that you 've just identified with going out with the report in one hand and the rules and the other I think in are they better ways and this could this this focus here it could well factor will be looking at other ways in which communities can be engaged in this kind of conversation so that is making it as relevant in real to to communities and in the east some new brighton kaiapoi as it is to the butcher and hornby and fiddle turn to your community those communities as well how we have that conversation not and i think that 's a key could be a key thing that we learn in these focus areas yeah how do we used anthropologists and storytellers and community leaders to lead in these these narratives all the work you have done is bringing some focus on us here I was going to thank you for joining the safer process you interagency group to cheer thank you I think tell agencies that actually there to actually made crisis just safe I think a degree a safe place and having

delegations and were merely making recommendations to the council and therefore a council was was dealing with with the business but in fact we do have some delegations to some committees now and it 's possible that could be extended in the future and it 's entirely appropriate that a committee makes the decision and correct so that 's the basis for the the substantive change of a which is a simply a removal of a qualification clause and standing and standing orders 3 17 point to point one second aspect is that the law last year was amended the local government act was amended to allow for absent members to participate in council meetings and suggestion came about and a very fairly short notice that that might be required by the council and we have proved through the use of technology for community board chairs reporting to the council that we can we can deliver despite the fact that we 've got heck up with our system today in terms of the sound but so the the change is proposed under certain circumstances to allow members to be present for to better participate sorry in the meeting and to to vote on matters but it doesn 't record them as being present because they 're not physically here and can 't be part of a quorum and that would answer the question that I had which is that the that the chair say the meeting because I wasn 't actually present but I could be present for the purposes of boating that 's correct right ok any questions Glenn Yanni Phil is it there yep thank you so just yeah just on the back of that last one Darrell so someone can vote but that vote can 't_''_186.89 be recorded some terms of actual for the record you know who voted for what a drawback there is that yeah I came back just okay oh no they can look they come they 're not counted as present for the purposes of quorum but they can that count as present for okay I thought I heard it is coroner came nose to the report of the voting yeah Yanni and then Phil yeah these changes and particularly with regards to minutes but I just wondered whether it was possible to incorporate and standing orders a requirement to record the resolutions like a resolution tracker like some committees I know that she 'd committee has one which is a really useful tool with people can look and see so it 's not the minutes it just a formal record of what are the requests that the committee or the council 's made and and what is the current status so as is there any way we could incorporate that into this review that 's a matter of the business of the council or the business of a committee I think that the third aspect to this report is that it suggests that a counselor or to assist the Secretariat to review all of our standing orders basically to bring them in to enter line with current thinking and and to change the language so that there in plain English and become more easily readable and assist the chairs in particular but also mirrors the conduct of meetings it 's an aspect of could become create considered I think that is an SP that could be considered because actually at the end of a meeting having having a list of the items drawn up as an attachment to the minutes I mean because everything is electronic these days so it 's not as though you could it 's a whole lot of additional work it 's of you know because sometimes they 're you know that they are formally recorded but there isn 't a mechanism for reporting back and it you do you sort of confirmed the minutes but you don 't you don 't really have a measure the rising on the agenda so anyway but it 's just an idea I think I think you 're offering to be one of the two counts of those Yanni Phil I think my my questions are even answer yep Andrew yeah just on the issue that we 're talking about about the the resolution tracker as we call it the Chad committing certainly works really well we put it on the item as an agenda at each me as an item on the agenda at each meeting which means that that 's the framework for discussing any outstanding matters that we 're waiting for report back on and it just allows for each decision that 's made or each request that 's made to be trapped which keeps everybody accountable but it means that it actually avoids questioning at the meeting or it should avoid got the information they 're set out in front of you around decisions that have been made previously so that was a comment but i also have a question and the to attend meetings online it 's a particular interest to me in my role as the ward council of a banks peninsula and the distances involved in in travel both for myself and for community board chairs and community board members in each direction and I attend attended inverted commas of informal meeting in a Corolla yesterday afternoon via Skype which was great the only problem being at the meeting room where the Community Board meets in a car oh we don 't have the benefits of the council system to allow us to to skype in or dial in the normal way so we just did it between two tablets and it was okay how we fixed in terms of the technical capacity to skype into those community board rooms other a number of board rooms that don 't have that equipment yet and is it going to be rolled out so we can be using that on actually the first one is there 's the standing orders for the council its committees community boards have their own standing orders currently they 're based on the council standing orders and they would need to be amended each one would need to be amended to allow our community board to conduct their meetings in that same way a second question is the council chamber has the facility we 've seen that with Pam Richardson coming through and chicken actually you can see her and she could watch you because our web casting live webcasting actually enables her to have a separate computer and yet so you have that complete visual as well as audio audio connection the law requires at least an audio connection only so it 's quite possible for for a member of a community board to participate in a community board meeting and buy an audio connection but we 'd have to look at other facilities of the community board or the council wanted a higher level of of interaction for absent members ok how 's your day and then Bucky Dover did it did you right Bucky one of the issues that came up last night at that youth voice can 't debris was the ability to make submissions by video not having to be there could we incorporate that somehow when we come to do the review that probably doesn 't require an amendment of standing orders we 've we 've already provided for that in the last 12 months we 've we advertised in terms of the long term plan that people could could make submissions using electronic means anybody can do that now and what we did we there was a trial really we were testing things but that 's a term of the orbea that would be a condition of the statutory consultation procedure we don 't do we need to get real environment no because it 's not a meeting of it sometimes they 're held by hearings they 're not meetings of the council and hearings aren 't can conducted under standing orders so if people want to do that now on anything can they do it we would we would can they do it physically yes we would held that we were capable of being able to do that and make better condition also hearings process okay thanks okay so can we replace two councillors with councillor johansson on council clearwater people are generally happy with that ellie would you like to be on that as well yep and councillor john so there 's no reason when it we don 't have to be restricted to two would take out the words to councillors and replace them councillor your hand son clearwater and jones to work with the secretariat to rewrite standing orders three is fine that 's that 's okay all right i 'll put yep Thank You Darryl for always work for this work because in fact this will really a surface us there their process of processes it 'll make you more efficient a new heaven things done electronically well and it 's all within the legislation to so yeah thank you darryl for a very capable yeah and thank hear from me too i 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye as opposed say no that 's carried the _"

    "text": "now we move on to the chief executives report thank you take their report has read and Lance any questions on it but I just want to speak to an issue that 's obviously been lots of public comment around the Gormley statues in the last few days and I understand how it appears that council may not have been prioritizing resources to the greatest need but I just want to clarify process I want to talk or debate the merits of the art pieces or whether it 's right or wrong decision but just do want to talk to the process in what option you might want to consider so thirsty council has for a long time allocated a public hearts arts fund around two hundred and eighty thousand per annum and the long-term plan and that accumulates as a capital fund for large public art pieces and recommendations are made council through the peg which is the public arts advisory group that consists of councillor representation community representation urban design and art experts and as a result of that council contributes to public art it doesn 't fully fund and investment and public art into the Gormley statue the process really was up there was an approach initially by the artists to contribute something back to the regeneration recovery of a city and then involved in that thinking was scape which is the art an industry trust the one that leverages that private investment and Sarah who are involved and obviously developing the avon river precinct public art trail and they are together put up towards a proposal to the peg Papa guards advisory group which then makes a recommendation to Council the funding that 's been used as not this year 's budget but has been accumulated from previous years and that 's generally what happens is that it 's not used all the time but as some thinking and discussion around this happens there now that accumulates it contributes to those public artworks we 've already got a substantial investment in public art in the city so there 's similar other works you you 're of course know about such the Regan gin tree the wheat shift or they the flower power I think it 's high street the chalice of course in solidarity grid are some of the examples of bad it 's really been part of what the sea council does in terms of place making and contributing to the cultural recovery of the city as I mention we still have this year 's funding available and just remind councillors you may recall that you proposed significantly reducing expenditure in public art and the long-term plan process and we had a number of solution submissions around how important public art was into the benefit of the city as a whole we also you recall at the hearings had a number who actually present on their issue and particularly about not taking away that funding or not reducing it and as a decision you decided not to significantly reduce it as was proposed so I guess not given that issues that have been raised and some of the concerns that you 've raised if you my suggestion really is that if you should consider that the city should not invest in public art being you might use your consultation process again through the annual pain in the long term plan as a generic issue you might want to ask a specific question about whether or not council should defer expenditure in public art over the next period of time and we have a capital expenditure on public art should either be reduced or as I say deferred over that period of time I think it 's an important question it shouldn 't be a debate that 's how or that 's media driven and that decision shouldn 't be media driven but one that the public besides through that process and I think although we 've sort of looked at the question before about what we spend nothing is important asked a specific question at this point in time thank you no I 'll just follow on from that I 'll just say that I think that the decision around this one and the decision was taken in December last year so as the chief executive asst said the the financing for this particular project did not come from the shears allocation so there 's been a lot of commentary around around the connection between funding so this allocation was made in December last year it 's obviously been announced as the additional funds that are required for what is to match our contribution and more gathered from other sources so so i think that the chief executives framed what we should do in response quite well because i guess that what 's happened is is that when you deal with a long-term plan you have a whole range of issues and people focus on the issues that matter to them you know whether it 's the you know under resourcing of the eastern whether that needs to be addressed whether it 's the level of rates increase whether there was been a tremendous focus on asset sales but no focus on the individual elements of what make up a long-term plan and I guess that what we 've tried to do and the preliminary focus on our long-term plan was to say to people you need to be looking at every aspect you can 't just take a a single point of entry just focusing on asset sales for example doesn 't mean you on and what are we investing on what are we considering in terms of other components rates increases the general max and i think you know that it 's a lot of what came through was a bit of a wake-up call in terms of how people can can be directed towards focusing on one one element and the asset sales was obviously a significant element that didn 't really then achieve what we were trying to achieve which was to get people to look more broadly at the different components of expenditure rates assets and return on assets and and and actually release of capital which doesn 't necessarily mean asset sales so you know so i think to actually ask the specific question when we go out to consult on our annual plan which is should we because of the earthquakes and the recovery process defer our expenditure in public art should we defer it for a period of time and what that would do is that that will create a genuine debate because there will be people who will say no you 'll be crazy to do really want to have a focus on art and there 'll be others who 'll say no it 's more important to get the road specs that 's more important to do this and we would want you to contribute that amount of money to that so that we can see that the money is going on there and that to me would focus the debate on an on a real issue and that would be the appropriate place to have it so I just think it 's a great idea from the chief executive to put the issue on the table so if I could David and then Glenn I just like to get an indication of what the public art group funding was accumulated funding was prior to the Gormley investment or alternatively what sitting there after what sort of money have they got in that fund after this it 's 290 you 've all been center a summer 200 yes some of its already allocated 290 roughly 11 thank you Glenn and then Ali time thank you what stood out for me and this is not so political filters and I guess we 're a political filter obviously but and with the organization to so that I think of another example of it happens to be I guess public art or an expression when it was proposed that the kin and the square would be moved and this is prior to the quakes and there was quite a an outcry ovett so it 's more just building in that filter and I anticipated that the people and culture committee could be a place for that and of course it can 't_''_568.529 be a place you know kind of a repository for every single little big decision through the organization so I don 't know with you had it seems to me you 're just a decision about where you delegate accountability an advice and you 've delegated this to the public art advisory group I mean no art expert so or urban design expert so there 's it 's not something that I could comment on and in terms of whether something 's a good decision or not specifically I think the issue really is council decide decisions and whether it 's happy to have something such as a group as that provide that advice and in the delegations as per normal within the organization and I 'm not saying that we as governments need to see really get it right but it 's at least yeah it goes through that that testing it so how 's it 's going to go well I I think that can be part of the general question but I 'm I don 't think that that is the right way to go i think that is I think Pierce made that delegating it to a blend of experts in community representatives as the ideal way to make such decisions for the city I mean the nucleus one who did that one of my brains just not functioning properly but I love it I love it you know in hey Phil price yeah every time I look at it I think you know because it survived the earthquakes you know the art survived the earthquakes you know and they really do give a great deal of pleasure even and amongst the we were allowed unto the inside the cordon to have a look around i mean i was a member of parliament at the time a group of us all went on what you know our hard hats on and everything and i took photos of that because it wasn 't broken and it really stood out as something that was you know sort of kind of a beacon and and that Homer you know I personally you know the ball you know I personally made a donation to that as well public art there 's something that 's available to everyone and it 's not just available to a private collector and that 's why I love Public Arts but let 's have the debate let 's have the debate about how we make these decisions and whether we should be allocating at this time I 'm a galley your knees I do think this is an honor oh no well let 's just deal with the Arts pierced and get that out of the way tell me you Arts Council lonsdale tournament self met with the co-chairs of PEG no Artie Xperia i 'm actually colorblind but like just reiterating rightly in and said that public art is crucial for a city and when you see it and see people 's reactions because of us so subjective that has actually really stimulated whether it is at the high end like the gormley 's etc or just locally created I mean signum lose summers at practice and we 've got those if he didn 't have to do that but that uplift in that community to see those three pieces which she changes around is absolutely fantastic and he said you may not like the pieces but the fitment people love the gesture and love the artwork because what what he did so I 'm all for it but I think the debate needs to be discussed yani and then Paul yeah thank you i think it was several considering things about this for me one is that a decision was made in december and i 'm not sure when we were told about it so I don 't understand in terms of decisions been made in December last year well it wasn 't the public art advisory groups job to notify Annie because it 's a skate project um that 's really agreement done between the council Ciera in skirt it correct that was the final funding agreement to remove but the public art advisory group made their decision on contribution back in December right but I mean you know carry on so the process of us actually being notified at an early stage on a no surprises basis clearly something like this the optics of it is around the extravagance of a hundred million dollars being spent on an avin River precinct and an arts trial by government and we 're contributing money when we 've got other places and other areas of the city that are crying out for attention through broken infrastructure for actually but yeah need this is my culture we go to identify sure about about the priorities the point I 'm making is I do think this moment was already allocated before it 's not and it was allocated and last year 's budget as well and I understand that it 's not it 's actually a question of how it 's been and what it 's spend on and that 's the point I 'm trying to make and I thought we had a paper coming around the public arts group to sign off processes both to counsel to elected members to staff and also I think timely to look at you know is it just the central city and the areas they 've got the most amount of money being invested that the public artwork goes into or do we get a chance yepyep to look we 're not discussing an issue now what we 're doing is working out a way of taking it forward so so um the number of things in the year i get the process has been that the peg does have the authority to make recommendations to council when it goes through council delegation process so it 's all with uncounseled delegation processes and I just remind you that peg the way that it works actually means that we only make a contribution to public art so for every dollar we invest they can find that sense there is some work going on on the review about public arts policy as included an hour long term plan that workers are going on as we speak but this really she really is about not the decision about this particular piece of work but whether you want to discuss were in debate with the community about how important cultural cover ears and the art as part of it into the future at this period of time and I agree with that but the point that there 's also agreements in here that have been done entered into on behalf of counsel that we haven 't signed off all as a governance body whereas we 've had other works like fanfare that did come in front of counsel for council consideration council resolution so if you think of location if so there 's other things other than the funding they actually are I think relevant to consider but also the use of local artists is another one that you know that at some stage will be good to discuss around local content so I don 't think just way to do it because there 's other issues that it 's not address so the publicly reveal the public art will look at all of those issues right so winners what 's the time frame for that given that it was already it 's underway at the moment but we know we like who you get well it would be really for the annual pain Paul and then Phil yeah I 'm on the peg sorry goddamn look that to me recovery is not just about fixing the roads and the infrastructure just make that point and peg does as Carlene pointed out produce 3.25 dollars from philanthropic funding for every dollar we put in and so we are they giving a hand up to the arts world and I think that you know we 've got to look at christ church and the contentious nature of public art that we 've seen in through the history of any installation we 've put in take the chalice for examples sake that was massively contentious like obviously the school me structure as provoking the same sort of reaction post the and their flowers around the chalice and remembrance of the people we lost through the earthquake so they now recognize that as a place they can actually go and reflect and I think that 's really really important that we keep that in mind while so sexually contentious at the moment for some I think in the future we may look back in a very different way so this suit you know it 's just want to make those points a fill group also look at the location of some of the artworks for example there 's a people a concern about the drought wood is an object being placed in the center of a river or waterway so it is a limitation of air works of art also be considered by Dinkley and so it 's a review of the policy so we could incorporate that as a policy issue in terms of how that 's addressed for each individual piece of real did you Andrew yeah I 've been involved in the earlier conversations in the review of the policy and it 's probably right for me to there has been some good involvement from staff that got it to a certain point we then had the meeting with members of the the peg and and that was a very interesting conversation as well allow us to take a balanced view it 's fair to say and I 'm very comfortable with where that 's at at the moment and I think it 'll bring some good outcomes that will address for example some of the points that counselor Johansson has just made I also think the idea of having a wider conversation about this part of the annual plan process is a good one the danger of the sort of discussion we 've had in the media over the last little while is that it all but the conversation becomes framed about one particular piece of work one particular location and that becomes the issue where actually the wider issue is where does public art fit into the overall scheme of things that council and others are doing in Christchurch in general how is that prioritized alongside other spending priorities in the context of constrained and spending a wider discussion about all of those things rather than it focusing on just one example of public art but I think one of the things that 's come out for me as part of this whole wider conversation so far is yes the need to be constrained in spending yes the need for public perceptions to be addressed but also the value that certain individuals and certain groups bring in terms of leverage to get outcomes that we perhaps otherwise wouldn 't get so it 's quite a wide conversation and a lot of that will be addressed in the work that carlene 's talked about in terms of developing this new policy that 's great now Ellie you wanted to raise something else snacks in Seoul I just don 't see that listed under the community engagement for me howling page 87 I 'm guessing you 're so I 'm probably just an oversight it 's cool so um still continues to be quite a lot of work about around it so just under 50 thousand calls of a call center which I think first month we had those have gone through quite seamlessly couple haven 't and right you 've raised particular issues around there so we 're looking at that indian process and i just want to acknowledge working with n columbus on there she and I had a conversation or the you are and you know we perfect example of what 's the problem how do we fix it if this is how we do it and i think we 're going to get here which is great yes I thank you got and it 's helpful to have specific examples rather than generalized shorter sure thank you it 's good thank you um Oh a cookie and then Jimmy just in the Super Center when the contact center on the same page page AC student achieved service level of 48 suit how do you measure the service level coming we 'll have targets around that so I 'm calls answered within a certain time or issues dealt with mr. within a certain time Jimmy one question regarding to our health and the safety issue on page 19 the medical injury july seven and the to know this kinda of the maid medical injury ages staff not follow the SOP or is the own site there 's no its OPD bears and wellness always kind of it could be any one of those so it might be something about not following procedures or it might be something around their own personal health issues so an example was somebody fainted in at an event so that 's an example of medical injury thank you alright um bill Yanni just want to comment on the report and it 's great there 's a photo of the new psych away oh I 've read under duty cycle beer which has been under me I 'm not it doesn 't need you in the attorney yeah but I did want to UM the minister was there broad council for is there 's a clear description of all the community engagement projects we 've been undertaken and clearly they have been really successful because we get got out we get that the project 's done I just want to comment it Mike the other thing I was going to raise the work and it was like a meeting of people who are part of scene in it and it 's just really whether that clearly under syncing up with the aging population in Christchurch is it a way that and that in fact council might even support seeing it for organizations like them even more yes so that the strength of libraries who used a lot of the existing networks to share and support share information and knowledge and to support them so certainly I think as in terms of all our engagement we try to use whatever networks are already there and and to build on those rather than try and set up you know new networks i just also come in on the community engagement because there has been a lot of work under and particularly most recently of course on the coastal hazards and it 's been significant with in terms of engagement team of communications in our planners who fronted up to you know large number of drop-in sessions and presentations largely in their own time to actually try and share that information and improve the was just under the CEO transition a note that we haven 't had briefings from Sarah or CCD you for several months now we used it and I 'm aware that they 've got some new personnel so is there any plans for us to actually have making more meetings with them or about eight minutes again so those meetings about transition or just a generic updating your ears know just in regards to ccd you and Sarah so you run the things that they 're doing like the stadium or like I mean obviously get close counselors some want updates on those particular things we can certainly arrange those I know that we 've been more focused on some of our internal issues and things such as you know other transitional issues that council directly has been involved in but if the area there are particular things that you 'd like to have updates on we can arrange yeah I think it would be not particularly women to Sarah have new staff coming and essentially giving me a chance to introduce ourselves meet them hey there 's the winding okay but I 'm the other the other thing I just wanted to check on with um was on the I just wanted to check on the earthquake rebuild so we 've we 've managed to get a map of the right which has been really good so this is an issue that 's come up I think several times so we 've got two met my daughter got like a warden air and it 's got different colors about what works skirts were which skirt which work is not skirt and in which work has been can play so it 's actually really really useful to be other I 'm explained to people just what 's happening the benefit that live code rebuild in regards to X miniature below budget on page 82 how currently of the unseen 300 and 400 25 million is skirt delivered work that 's away through the uncertainty of funding under the cost share mm-hmm and I just wanted to kind of get a sense of with these color-coordinated which is that which work of that that 's been delayed is that the ones zit the work that some below that we 've said there 's work that 's going to be done by skirt and what 's what 's the impact on our community I just asked Dave to respond environment is we are how 's that going to be funded totally so that we can release all we 're hoping to get that completed within that to 16 or December 2016 and where do we go from here so we 're hoping that that will then enable us to finalize the program and then we would be able to answer that question over the next probably a couple of months when I do say that one of the things to be very careful about that map because some of it might be total restructure or rebuilding of that road and others might be just patching potholes and they may be both seen as read on that line so just because they 'll read if it 's a map that I 'm thinking that maybe it doesn 't necessarily mean the same thing in every street if that makes sense some of that even reconstruction the whole world so it does take a little bit of interpreting is it possible to get a communications plan particularly to those areas that are you know most affected by it where council will be doing the work over what the timing and the second thing is that 's a part of the capital program review that we 're planning to do is to have a whole comms around so when people can expect things to be done that is that 's what we want to get to but at the moment we don 't actually we don 't have you know the detailed analysis of the forward plan arising out of the horizontal infrastructure review which confirmed how much was actually included in the scope program and how much awesome so there 's still quite a bit of work to do with underskirt so you know I think staff working as hard as they can to get something meaningful together because you know letting people know what 's going to happen win will be part of the reassurance that people are looking for but what what 's okay it 's okay it 's okay cool you can follow us me all right so I 'll would someone like to move that the report we received our Paul second of Jamie I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried

    "text": "once we 've had this deputation will will have morning tea Thank You Metta mirin counselors and I will attempt to be brief I just wanted to talk about they kept that he doesn 't believe I can be um I just wanted to talk about the capital endowment fund which was something that the council put aside 75 million a number of years ago to put funds aside over and above what we had in from our trading assets for economic development and for social issues the paper that i read i read about in the paper the paper that i read are downloaded i think has got a number of holes in it and issues like significance tests that there 's no material impact on rates i think is completely wrong and the viability of this fund was only tested really against low interest rates and i think that the it raises the question of whether the guidelines for investment need revisiting by you as counselors it considered three options for the fund and it completely must out an additional option which test which i think should have end I 'll come to that in a minute it 's being used partially for internal investment which means the funders and dealing the potential that it could and if the hundred million dollars is put into the into the pot the black hole called death and the council will only be saving the cost of interest which will be 3.5 three-point-seven percent probably I would think that 's a bill that you 'll pay pardon yes but so I I think I I support the concept of active management I think that one of the things that council should consider is an outside agency managing the capital endowment fund I looked at the possibility of which public agencies would be able to manage this I looked at the National super fund which has a good rate of return and also looked at the rasa Foundation which is the Canterbury Community Trust was the Canterbury Community Trust the investment policy should be conservative transparent and locally accountable in my opinion and so when you apply these tests the right of foundation comes up as a solution I approached the chairman they be interested in potentially managingness fund and he said yes when you look at what they earned in the last year it was 10.2 percent return on investment after allowing for inflation if you apply this to what the the fund end this year compared with the router foundation you will have end an additional five point four million dollars in innings extra and in my opinion you may have missed the inning innings are between 20 and 30 million over the last five years this proposal would reduce the rates burden by between one and two percent so I sit here and make a an offer and I think I listening to the Victoria Square discussion before there 's a lot of us out on us in the city that want to assist you people in your huge burden as counselors and I 'm doing this as one I 've spoken with Roger bridge and he would be prepared to go into a little working party I would like to make a suggestion that may be counselor mangion council tuna and Roger Bridger myself sit down go through back Tim to the strategy and resources committee with a solution I think that this to close this fund would be a serious mistake thank you thank you questions at Phil we 'll just for clarification as councils we discuss us but my recollections of the last Ridge and Finance Committee in effect the fun was closed anyway there doesn 't come to counsel you don 't know no it hasn 't come to a council and it has to be it 'll come to council next time but I think you 're suggesting that a group of you meet yeah between now and then so that you can actually report back to the next council meeting w it has to go through a public consultation which is the annual planning process so we don 't have the powder close it down it 's good without a public engagement and and I don 't think that that was the I think the recommendation from strategy and Finance was that it that it go forward for consideration as part of the annual plan process but that 's my memory of what wasn 't_''_345.69 at the meeting okay yeah my question to Gary though is that if in fact say the fun goes to the management through the router fund how in fact if there 's a agent request but for example for mere residents how in fact was a council we could could access some of their money if it 's being managed by another whole phone I don 't know if you 've made a call like that no no we don 't spin the capital we spend the income they would still give us the income you 'd still give you a long as that yeah yeah but but that I think what Gary 's suggesting is that a small group of people go away and assess whether this is a viable possibility because if it 's viable then it should be put in the mix for consideration as part of the annual plan process so Yanni and then Andrew yeah I 'm think thank you Gary for the deputation I was trying to find the graph of the initial public consultation when the Thunder stood up and from go to civic and community projects and not so much economic well the whole street no it was seventy percent economic thirty percent civic yeah that 's her how it was set up but the public consultation was quite different but do you think it would be also timely to look at how the funds being utilized as to what it 's been funding and whether we should look at any tweaks there is perhaps process this not what I 'm talking about I 'm talking about management of the fund and then as councillors you decide on the policy of how its divvied up yeah Andrew thank you so I 'm just to clarify is the management of the fund as in the investment management of the funds that you 're suggesting that we set the working group up to group up to talk about as accurate the distribution of the interest on the fund would remain a matter for council you 're not arresting that any outside aims to get involved in that and just a second question I 'm assuming that this matter will come to the Finance Committee meeting where this was considered do you feel the working group would be able to do it to work in the relatively short time period between now and then so the daily recommendation from the group can be considered alongside that report yes Grayson timber thank you thanks Gary I think the question that you 've raised is a she a really good one whether it 's the router group or whatever the product managed by a puppet fund well I a private management company to give the beast or two and possible the people of Christchurch is actually a very good question so thank you for writing in the the reason why i recommend my personal viewers the router fun because brighter foundation rather is that it 's got its own transparency it is trends it is accountable to our community already so all of their investment portfolio and everything is in front of everybody they 've just released it just recently so it 's not her I think there 's a whole lot of other places you could go but this is local and the has level of comfort we 're looking at long-term investment for this fund we 'd be wanting to look at the history of the rat account foundation just not the last two to five years but longer just to get an over there 's a lot of learning of the group Teresa yeah but that 's managed you 've got to look at how its performing now Thank You Emma it 's a concept that some well with raising so thank you very much for doing so thank you alright so if we could have a quick break for morning tea and we can consider that when we come back and it 's so 15 minutes is it enough 25 past we 're going to restart again at 25 pass thank you _"

    "text": "please tune to clause 12-a age 309 of the report and we 've got people working hard to develop some amendments arising out of that as I said in relation to the second deputation that we actually have been thinking about how we engage ourselves in this process I think the sense that we have and it 's a public census people want to get on with it but they want to not let go off the engagement process so I think it 's a combination of take your time as quickly as you can and but it 's it 's it 's it 's making sure that the things that things happen but also that the right things happen and that the community are engaged in that process so we 've come up with some amendments which pretty much pick up the idea that was presented as a potential amendment that which has endorsed the idea is identified in the Victoria Square restoration plan as the basis for developing design solutions so that picks up that element there and rather than that ccd you continue we would request that as the community 's voice and the consideration of design concepts for any changes proposed to be made to the square and then that the council the reference group no no no no we 've got it that the council established a working group of counselors yeah Nia Henson Paul lonsdale Pauline cotta and Thomas Kendra to meet and work with the Victoria Square reference group which we well I had it which we recommend to continue to meet but that the council established I thought you took the names of the winds but we 've given these we would give Ackley 's authority look look back to this beautiful yeah no no they meet with them they work together but the council established a working group or counselors young your hands and pull on style pulling quadrant Thomas Kendrick to meet and work with the victorious where reference group throughout the process and I mean it you can play with the widow but but the idea the idea is that we engage with the reference group directly through four councillors who essentially have the ability to resolve this right we were trying to achieve here is to is to get on with it we don 't want to slow things down and have reports coming back and blower blower what we want to do is get on with that but we want to make sure that the right sort of influence and supporters there so that the community voice is heard throughout this process and it 's been a very good process you know that 's the other thing is that there isn 't a single person around this table that wants in any way for anyone to think that this wasn 't so much better then it would have been if things had proceeded without any engagement with the community so let 's start with the question of cost because that has come up with particular councils having raised that as a particular issue so are you able to just give us an overview of how much the proposal was going to call stand how much it would likely cost now so I am this is on oh well I think it will be tuned up when you no updated information relating to the total cost of the avin of a precinct project because the Victoria Square component as part of the overall even of a precinct project I just remind council that under the cost share agreement councils contribution to that project is six point three or six point four million dollars I can 't actually remember the the point but its candidates to the whole precinct does that whole precinct yeah yeah does does that does that does that include the playground as well yes yeah so that 's right that 's right from the hospital little all the way through to reach Manchester straight karite okay yep I 'm beyond Manchester Street actually to Madras madrese so and and the total costs that the Crown 's committed to as 90-something milling because it 's a hundred million total asthma I think in 89 agreement so it 's about 95 in the cost share agreement it 's identified is 90s the total project cost and I can face this as a cost-share agreement from Molly 2012 yeah yeah um no 2013 19 6 million it 's identified here is 6.8 million 6.8 million and I actually thought that was for the playground and it was but is that not the case in this in the some vision of the cashier agreement that I have now that that is the only version so there 's no we 're his radio show education of the of that 6.8 to any component identified is for the sinker project okay that 's good alright so Yanni I think for us is that we inherit the operational costs so I don 't when do you think we will be in a position to actually know what the capex says and then all the associated depreciation costs and the objects cost the work that 's been done in raising costs so far if the if the hard surfacing changes in the square shoulders when you that 's also the operational costs over time will be listened and because the day is actually deteriorated need replacing what the well there 's no detail design is Graham pointed out the overall concept hasn 't changed so you 're welcome Alex your square meal in them trees sustain the store lights to run the operation costs the original cost was 12 million and we 're still expecting around 12 so the point that was made it is how can we endorse the I think it 's 3.3 but the the plan when we haven 't got the detailed plan by is it I 've given what we could is it possible to change the owner says 3.3 needs to be changed because of 3.1 so what we want is direct the chief executor provide a formal response of council endorsement of Victoria Square Bristol operation plan once that has been our 2015 once that has been signed off by the working group so once it has been confirmed by the working group because then that that just leaves the working group with the decision when we 're approving in principle essentially we want to get on with the job but we want to have a mechanism for ensuring that there is that community voice enjoy endorse well although you could you could say rather than the eye eid is identified and awesome principle they could was that and then take out um because the Devils in the detail it 's very hard to even endorse and principal because actually there 's a number of things that could significantly change the aesthetic the immunity of the square that we simply don 't know so appreciate that you 've set up another process but we 're delegating that to you yeah so so the question is if we 're delegating it to another growth why we why would we what 's the benefit of endorsing it now rather than do it it 's in principle where we 're saying to the group we 're good with us and we 're leaving it to you to sort out the detail and just the final question the comment on the the vehicle access and the cycleways have we done any work around the cycleways and how they connect in this in this quadrant of the central city because I know that for example we 've approved the cycleway coming into the are my street bridge and we 've also got a cycleway going on sales very straight but it is going to be at main cycle route and as I going to connect nickel tour as if other things we need to be aware of given the deputation around vehicle access through the resolution of the cycleways our East within an accessible City and I note that is identified in their deputations it the cycleway runs along the delegate it 's call it the court side of the of the river a true left bank of the river into the branch and then they have to go across and then they get to the town hall so they 're not likely to really I mean they 're still like that they 're going from we still east yep to have to go through 10 um I guess following on from what yani tseng because it does seem a wee bit of siloing because they should be I was just looking at this plan and I guess it will come through without working with the the Victoria Square reference group that little be I 'm very much looking forward to that the marriage if you like between the the caught yourself and the Town Hall what 's been the liaison between the rebuild of the town hall and this area here I mean the marriage of the two areas I mean I 've done and my previous life Shakespeare across the river and all this and it just seems a perfect opportunity to look at that the entire area of the outdoors of the town hall and Victoria Square blending together and it is nothing here and we also hear about all these cycleways are part of the accessible city but they get to this bridge from the port side of the river but do they suddenly splinter off and go different directions and I 'm just wondering has there been discussion with the roof read that rebuild team of town hall with regard to the few that David and some would like to respond to them we 're putting together at the entrance or something down horbas Merrigan and you 'll see there 's definite lines of what we 're doing will buck up and marry him very well on that with regard than I can 't give you main cycle does come down past the courts and in theory across the bridge because it can 't get through parts of town orbiters down the hall school why don 't we the riverbank but I haven 't_''_778.13 that detail of that hasn 't been done and that 's part of what will be part of this theme here and you can see it 's been incorporating slightly in five of yours but the detail is simply what we 're doing outside of course very much aligned guess one thing 's for moving forward with the servitor square reference group and their own working party together I 'd like to have those combined to the public connection to see the overall vision because at the moment I 'm because I would like to see it all in one and present it to the public rather then and what could be defined a Cylon to thank you and Paul for this question that how easy it is taught psychosis driving treachery anyway even though these lunes against it remember when we t2 then skateboarders from wimpy theater what signs and that any other parts of this resolution that need to be kind of removed as 3.5 need to go in the meantime approve the restoration improvement identified in the Victoria Square it for the diagonal pedestrian way is that does it go in the meantime or does that stay I can 't tell could I just perhaps um yeah um clarified because actually that I recognize now that i read that recommendation from this end of the of the UM table it 's the pedestrian ride it runs from the Hamish heybridge up to victoria street ah trials that 's out Lee asked you for that to be included in the consultation and as I noted in the report I think it was ninety-six percent of respondents said it was a good idea to actually retain there is a pedestrian route but we 've got that we 've got that on 3.3 Hemenway sorry so that 's to end it so that sorry three point three point three point five is when the works are undertaken that the advice I received was that council would need to approve Sara undertaking those wigs so so don 't don 't we need to link 3.3 and 3.5 then it seems odd that they are separated from each other because they don 't look like part of the same thing yeah so so why don 't we just pull up 3.5 and add up to 3.3 so we 're consistently so and and approve the retention and the intima that I verb and approve the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery but undertaking the rest of the for the diagonal bit once approved so yeah I mean what once end once approved and once but I thought their tongue granted your suggestion and dr. were seducing around this be the basis for debate no hang on sorry tetek rather than approving of that way but in fact we we approve this is the basis for the sort of developing future yeah but but what we 're saying is that we 're actually approving in the interim the diagonal pedestrian pathway so I mean it 's our land but and it 's basically and and approve so it shouldn 't be once approved and approve the Canterbury Earthquake time that they do at the same time that they do the other works I mean and then it 's linked to the doing the other works I mean we should actually authorize them to do the work at the same time because that will it will hold things up if they have to come back here after the fact so I just want to get the resolutions correct and then once I 've got them correct will have the debate yeah can we have some consistency and pedestrian and the wording on that because you 've used the phrase pedestrian pathway it says diagonal pedestrian path that says diagonal pedestrian way I mean I imagine we 're talking about the same thing out if we can just be consistently attention in the interim of the diagonal pedestrian path and the victoria square Rooter and approve the Canterbury Earthquake undertaking the restoration and improvement we look you don 't need to you don 't need to identify the victorious where again so undertaking the restoration and improvement of them off the path at the same time off the pedestrian path yep to the north of the river correct yes yeah no because it 's referred to in the report clearly as the link okay victorious alpha diagonal pedestrian path ok Victoria Street connection yeah just put it in brick at Sabine put it at the beginning like so in the diagonal pedestrian path and breakups Victoria Street connection how 's that they 're talking with the Victoria Square reference group because the MP theatre was actually a very good functioning area for intimate events and I 'm with regards to the site plan on our page 329 that looks like there is no amphitheater at all so it 's just in the interim and it 's just we 're approving it so you could get for to make things happen but you can reduce this when we meet with the reference group is at the moment on the page as over fear 2 329 there is no fu theater but it 's just a nice grassed area with a walkway throat and that 's really consuming but I have a good reference for this link Pauline can you answer the hi don 't know that i have that shows completely the lens the lens status but it 's our understanding that the pieces of lend march worth 25 and on the plane on page 15 and you have got something via but we think that there 's council and it 's not it 's not in it may be held in fee simple so that that would be outside of the scope of works it 's simply that pedestrian way that council asks to be included that diagonal to be included to give a legible link to victoria square hmm so 25 would be outside the scope of works which is we 're the empty theater yeah was let 's still got that still subject to fear that we 've been detailed design but then we 're not including the donor for the connection waiting if it 's the outside the scope so we 've done spread that but it is outside the scope and that 's why we 're putting it on there can we put the interview go just sick and this comes back to my earlier statement in the diagonal pedestrian path but that goes right through the middle no that 's what we 've just heard and social advice from staff saying it 's not included but we also heard from staff that there is a work that we have written with the Town Hall to that there 's a lokanath some plans and discussions here but there would be outside this as well I 'm sorry so I mean but this is not what we 're approving in 3.3 or if I got that wrong soso win council had earlier briefings with CC to you we did not include the crowne plaza site we specifically excluded it and I thought we are including it now for them to do the work at the same time they 're undertaking other word for only for that diagonal edge is an interim connection between Victoria Square in victoria street so the report quite specifically refers to the fact that in the future because this land has held that the former crowne plaza site is counseling held and fee simple title that you will need to make a decision your future but in the interim because people are using this part of it I think you has indicated that it was appropriate to consider how that diagonal was an improved to make it better amenity then the rubble surface or gravel surface editors now so you my understanding is that you asked ccd you to include that in their consultation process yeah that console toaster tation process has identified that the community would like that diagonal retained and to have a guess and improved surface there in the interim for that ease of access check what we 're doing though cuz oh look i I just I do want to get these the wording right and then and then we can open it up to debate so Pauline I just wanted to I think the only is on the same page to clarify what is the view of the surface is it would do to keep the Cyprus out of batteries we 're south of these labels and bounded by Colombo two rivers does it review we have I 'm asking what the panel screws was that set for referring to so yes if if what 's on them on the diagram is part of an accessible City then that clearly identifies that there are some cycling routes through victoria square I think if you stand on Victoria Square today you will see that cyclist i use in victoria square right now just just to be really clear we 've got a gravel pathway and all we need to do is seal it and we 're having a big debate about whether we asked Sarah to do it like I don 't understand what the difference no we 're just approving them to do it at the same time that they do other work and Victoria Square that 's all but but I mean rather than coming back to us it 's our land but we could just steal it anyway we could do it ourselves that 's right so so well there is no funding to seal there 's no doubt we have any we have so set aside funding but we could wait till the annual plan next year and take a console to pay as part you have agreed to come to fund it if we ask for it as I understand it they have agreed to fund the retention in paving of this yet and they may reuse some of the materials from Victoria Square should you reach the point where the working group in the community reference group agreed with the design because at the moment we 're not approving the amphitheater in this resolution are we the temporary Parkway runs across the middle of the epidural it does now then remain as a temporary pathway you know Matt might be upgraded to make it smooth it and little no decision no work will be undertaken on the remainder of any level they have to City Council with ya David can you help out two down 17 what 's on page 29 regionally reasonably low they actually does incorporate a number 25 pound via settle score in here and we are integrating with some of that word that 's had 10 so fly into the public area we 're working with heritage people that we have got put some constraints in there about what next time it 's number four it 's number four plan just picking up the issue of the cycles as I understand it just from a email from Sarah who chairs the group cycles are currently planned to go through the square not just around the other side that correct so we are basing our comments on inaccessible city and um like this the cycles will come down and then go down the path that 's Matt 17 I think that 's the route for inaccessible city cycles so this is from Sarah Templeton so she 's saying and cycles are currently planned to go through the square not just on the other side so we need to sort out the legal status of having cycles through it public opinion was divided on this it 's what she said yeah so I think we just need to make sure that they do do that and whether we need to incorporate look I 'm really worried about the fact that you know we 've had we 've had three deputations which were added such huge value to this issue we 've where we can we can resolve this and I 'm worried that we 're now getting into the minutiae I the detail I 'm really happy to delegate the decision making to Pauling Tim yani in pool working and collaboration with the local community linking into sarah and ccd you I do not want us to be sending the message that we want to hold this up I 'm you know I 'm really frustrated by you know the degree of you know sort of I don 't know giving an amongst the weeds at high level yes the delegate yeah I 'd like to move that the resolution but to do all right so um do we have a mover for this for this resolution Pauline and Paul so um is there any discussion yard well I think that it 's actually been really great to have the community reference truth and the pellet submissions and actually and I know now 's not the time to drop resolutions but actually if you think about the avon river precinct in cathedral square whether this is a model that we could get a really good outcome when you can talk to people about what the different needs are I think for me that I 'm happy to support this today but I do think the point that was made as that we do need to see the detailed design because it is so much uncertainty and unknown about what 's actually being proposed and if you just take the cycleway issue which is a really major show where we want to encourage like this coming a little center of sea and we want to encourage behavior change but we also want to have areas where people can relax and can have a more passive recreation rather than a collective recreation and it does seem to me that we still need to kind of work through the weather cyclists as vehicles should be going through victoria square or not so i just flag that as something that we should ever really good look at through that smaller growth because it does seem a little bit illogical that you would you would crack points of conflict and particularly if you wanted to retain go through the middle of that raises all sorts of concerns so i am a little bit concerned about even doing spending money improving an area that could could change balance against all the other priorities we have and if you think of summer when you 've got that global pathway around where the containers are I mean that would be great to get that sealed if it 's going to be for a while as well so we do need and I know with us with some work around fixing other footpaths and broken communities so you know I think that 's why victorious were to check with so much the teacher because of the initial proposal the huge cost when we 've got other things that people see as been a priority and something that people really liked and enjoyed and I guess in conclusion I 'll just you know this is quite a for me there 's a strong connection here with the skateboarders which is how I kind of got ended up in local body politics was when Victoria Square was redesigned and it 's an the best skate park that wasn 't supposed to be a skate park and all the skaters went there in you sir because it was fantastically laid out the skate on so I know very well first hand of the conflicts that have arisen in this in this important space and that 's why I think it is really important to be clear about what use we want and the design should match that so yeah that 's my view on it so subject to advise them I 've changed the mover and seconder some myself and councillor back on the basis that it 's all the deputy Emir on the basis that it 's um that the two people that moved and seconded it we 're going to be on the delegated decision making so but anyway Tim so this is anyone opposed to this they could speak otherwise these product sorry she allowed to speak yeah no thanks and I did and I 've listened to a lot of people over the time sorry again but Victoria Square is the jewel on the crown I 've done a years and I 've done from Shakespeare to rock to all sorts of things and I 've seen people just sitting down in the grass and heavy papers so I 'm for me I 'm really looking forward to working with the Victoria Square reference group and that to me is the key because I have some issues but you 've done a huge amount of work and I really look forward to working with you thank you thank you i 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye as opposed say no that 's carried thank you very much I _"

Wagner and ccd are concerned that any planned additional artworks and it should read standalone elements shared heritage experiences of which there are two to be reconsidered than a commitment we saw that the Christchurch residents be consulted before when he placement occurs I should note the Victoria Square has already two statues of fountain flagged poles trees light standards and edwardian telephone box so vigorous assessment should be done before any more are added and there seems to be a concentration on on putting objects into Victoria Square and I look at the rest of the avon river aside from one recent art object and it 's quite bare I 'm wondering why there 's such concentration particularly on putting objects more objects in the Victoria Square there seems to be a parallel process of this night ah who for standalone elements which has been permanently identified which seems to be running parallel to that would be nice if it was combined it also request that councillors seek more detail from CC view on the extent of the widening of the pathways in ascertained if it is required and the measures to be used to ensure that cyclists are diverted away from using Victoria squares central path the draft plan is unclear on these issues and I endorse grant ages observations about it being a diagram as an experienced done on Victoria Square which I spent a little time recently there 's a city care on the Riverside one of the pathways with city care truck parked there and two people could walk past easily so it 's quite a wide path way it is now I 'm not sure how much wider you would need it to be and I 'm still unclear of how they propose to resolve cycling issues the Victoria connection coming through which is a great idea it 's going to lead people straight through and the risk plans to divert plan to do it I don 't think putting a sign up as a private saying don 't know cyclist councillors thank you very much forcing the deputation I 'm Yanni and then Vicki one of the concerns that people raised it was just the cost of money being speed have you seen with the revised plan any budget or any do you have any understanding of what the associated costs are still going to be with the proposal no we 've had no communication as to what 's happened the only formal communication we 've had as the consultation at Knox church where the reference group were there room with people there which I thought was a great idea with full plans where they discussed any concerns the public head but we 've had no indication of costs I endorse grown ages what proposal that the reference group be maintained and work through it because i think the costumes will shut to emerge when the design work is done then they 'll get a clearer picture Bucky because my question was going to be do you endorse the recommendations 've answered already yes I think that 's I 'm very mindful that we don 't want to hold up the work that 's being done on a Victoria Square and I think it 's important part of the next stage of the rebuild of the city on a public space yes I think it 's it appears to worked well and and the group seemed to worked well and there 's a good selection of people I 'm glean thank you thank you mark this has been a great exercise in democracy once people knew what was going on so the previous deputation said talked about there being devil in the detail but actually no detail when you look at the report it 's a good thick report talks about elements in the millimeter but you still feel there 's no actually throat down detail as well so that that 's correct yeah I I cannot ascertain because the plan gives me but doesn 't it you say how wide the pathway is we sort of an unusual processes because I 'm sort of one step behind I notice i have not had any communications with staff where that no one came to us and asked us about our opinion or what we thought were our reaction to it because we still one step away from this one because the public participation that has gone and you are acting as our representatives but you we do need more detail it 's important to see the detail any further very good okay thank you very much so if _"

Jeff rice is a historian and university lecturer and as extend apology to from Sarah Templeton news the cheer of the Victoria Square community reference group she couldn 't be here today just briefly the background of the reference group that was formed in response to significant public concern about the earlier ccdu proposal to radically change the original square design as we all know the purpose of the group and this is in the invitation note to people to join the to accept reference group membership was to assist public submissions and feedback and ensure that at all stages of the process community views are reflected in the design of the square our role is to be the voice of the community in the process ensuring that decisions made a the design process the group to date has been engaged in part with developing and endorsing the public consultation process there 's been a high level of consensus and empathy within the group in regards the public 's own views on what should happen so we would like council to support the continuation of the group 's involvement as a watchdog if you like in the development of the design process it 's disappointing that ccd you have not engaged with the reference group about this latest version of its design intent the analysis diagrams that are included in the report have been discussed in pretty much reflecting the original spatial design circulation layouts that were formed as part of the original design so it 's just really there for your information we did meet following the public publication of the latest feedback document and we welcome the inclusion of reference to the current award-winning design at the beginning of the executive summary we welcome the deletion of really a rather incongruous straight footpath into the Boca fountain but members of the group had other concerns as well and we aspect however our involvement in evaluating more detail is not guaranteed and that 's why dr. rice and I are here today the report and plan that council has been asked to endorse does not propose any design solutions it is misleading to call it a restoration plan at this stage of the process it is merely a plan with numbers confirming a design strategy it would in my opinion be highly inappropriate for council to endorse this plan as being anything other than a technical brief a technical brief for the design team what needs to happen next is some design development and preparation of actual concepts that show the physical reality of any changes proposed what will the light poles look like what materials will are paving and wolves be made of and do they maintain existing patterns how wide will the footpaths be we will a seating be L will ni Tohu referencing be incorporated and what will that look like all these things are design issues that are open to a high degree of interpretation and varying degrees of subtlety there is no detail and the you consider perhaps a couple of amendments to the staff recommendations that reflect this uncertainty and just to be helpful for your doubles later on I 've suggested perhaps you could amend the current recommendation 3.1 along the lines endorse the ideas because we 've got to keep moving on this project it 's it 's not worth while holding it up much longer but there 's just some things that you could say so endorse the ideas identified in the Victoria Square restoration plan September 2015 as the basis for developing design solutions and perhaps you might want to consider adding a couple of new recommendations that for example the CCD you continue to involve the Victoria Square reference group as the community 's voice in the consideration of design concepts for any changes proposed to be made to the square and that the reference groups reports back to Council that it has reached consensus for endorsement of any proposed design interventions proposed by ccdu as a landscape architect familiar with the design process for public spaces I am very concerned that your endorsement of the staff recommendations could embarrassment to the minister and council other members of the reference group are equally concerned about the situation we 're not advocating designed by committee but rather critiquing and in an informed way the community aspirations in mind let 's dr. Weiss I 'm not going to make a speech I just want to endorse what grant has already said and to emphasize that I 'm here simply as a ratepayer the taxpayer anxious about wastage of public money and it already a great deal money has been spent on consultations and various processes we 're just anxious that we don 't lose sight of the public 's input in the design process I mean despite not knowing what you were going to be raising specifically in your deputation you 'll be probably be quite pleased but how much we are aligned on this matter Pauline well thank you look I 'm not sure if you had the answer to this Andrew the deputation pictures I 'm being the reference but have you been given any indication of the time that this project once it begins will will take know really to some extent depends on on the level of interventions they might make there 's a suggestion for asset management reasons there for example footpaths would need to be relayed with some sort of paving and perhaps the walls reconstructed so you 're looking at a several months of construction I would think do you have any concerns were you I 'd view of the number of foot passes that 's a little bit vague and important i only bling up from the from the barrier free survey here and on every page it seems to have a recommendation for water in the path which initially I thought it was only one path being wider but it seems to be more do you have any idea how many no I 'm wearing cheer about there too I mean at the moment I had a feeling that might have been the one round the round the river the ash felt footpath and that the others would pretty much remain the same but again it 's it 's all a bit unclear and there 's no detail Tim what 's reference any liaison with at the events industry and I 'm not talking about the glitzy cider but I 'm talking about the nuts and bolts the mud lee side of it the production side there are some i experienced concerns about this has there been any liaison with yourselves and others about the deliveries who 's the tourist carry over towards yes one of the members of the reference group is from it wasn 't tourism can 't agree you know so i have had something bit i 'm talking about that the actual delivery the nuts and bolts actually pecking and pecking out because there are so many events i 've been involved with many many over the years so my concerns are more the practical side for deliverance i 'd rather then the promotion side I think my understanding is in the in the redevelopment or there would be inclusion for things like plugs and those sort of a sort of issues that might help facilitate better events to take place okay I mean this is an opportunity to make the square more fit for purpose well then equipment for events as a good idea to do but I 'm just a bit anxious that in the process that the detail of the square might get changed out of all recognition and our concern is to follow the public submissions and to maintain as much as possible what 's already there if it ain 't broke don 't fix it an answer to your question counselor cotta they identified something like do two things that were broken but this came right down to little things like cracks and retaining walls and things like that which I guess with one of the area 's I 'm looking at on Memphis area 20 that 's got 20 10 and 21 on it it 's the large lawn and with us with the site plan here with the rise in the middle that area that 's used you know for the YMCA kills work n lot as the biggest space biggest green area technically it 's now broken into two with the hump in the middle so I 'm just looking at that and this yeah but as I say the up you guys and your captors thank you felt she had pathway with salt with cycles and your suggestion to is around how the the concepts now need some design development and particularly say if you were to continue to be involved with that without asking you for any detail it do you see a way for an alternative space if you like maybe the one that has been suggested on the other side the river for psycho ways so that in fact this conflict in the legal aspect which has been raised with us and we deal with they 've got any suggestions about their at a high level or not yeah I 'm not sure the legal aspect that yeah it 's been talked about in terms of the definition of a cycle whatever if it is under the transport Hector cycle is a bike as a vehicle then I suppose technically designating the path on the north side as a cycleway doesn 't I would thought prohibit people actually biking through the park so that 's a potential solution up I would say so in it how the last 30 years I don 't know anybody who in that way maybe the heavy but you know how and how is it going to change we 're not really doing anything different perhaps encouraging more people to get out and bike but okay thank you think thank you very much and that 's much appreciated that you took the time to make that and playing around with some of your recommendations and I think we 'll get to a good good place on this thank you I 'm at drag _"

    "text": "move on to deputations by appointment and I think ending what you 'd like to go first Anders thank you good um good morning mere does Ellen counsel us thank you for granting my deputation request and there 's a handout which I expect that you may have I know today we reach another milestone for the restoration of Victoria Square you 're being asked to consider and endorse the Victoria Square restoration plan September 2015 before it 's submitted to the Associate Minister for Canterbury Earthquake Recovery for her approval statutory compliance which is the subject of by deputation the council staff recommendations include that the council note that the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority will be responsible for any statutory compliance in relation to the Victoria Square restoration plan however I wish to draw your attention to a legal matter relevant to the council 's decision making obligations it relates to the restoration plans proposed cycling routes and Victoria Square the restoration plan first frequently to cyclists and cycle routes in or through victoria square now I 've highlighted emphasized the particular wording for example links to Victoria Square routes having well connected pedestrian and cycle routes to get more people moving through Victoria Square pedestrians and cyclists have safe and suitably sized routes through Victoria Square this project will improve the space provided for pedestrians and cyclists relevant however to your decision-making obligations is the legislation applicable to Victoria Square namely the quest ships that he reserves empowering at 1971 the council staff report is silent in this respect the city reserves empowering it is an act to redefine the purposes for which certain reserves in the city of christchurch held schedule 313 number 35 defines the area known as victoria square in terms of that act is all that plot of land known as victoria square bounded on the east by colombo street on the south by armored street and on the west and northwest by the river avon and the schedule includes victoria square and the list of vested reserves for the purposes of lawns ornamental gardens and ornamental buildings section 7 lawns ornamental gardens and ornamental buildings and includes the statue of John Robert godly which is in the square the pieces of land described to be vested in the corporation as reserves for the use of the inhabitants of the city of christchurch for the purposes of lawns ornamental gardens and ornamental buildings furthermore and respect of cycling and victoria square victorious square is not vest as a recreation reserve which would allow recreational cycling victoria street which previously traversed victoria square was stopped 1988 according to the NZTA a bicycle as classified as a vehicle from the wording of the city reserves impairing act it 's evident that the SEC doesn 't provide for vehicle use within the area defined in this act as Victoria Square vehicle use include cycling endorsement of the Victoria Square restoration plan and its current form referring to and providing for cyclists in cycle routes and north through Victoria Square would be inconsistent with the city reserves empowering eight I 've discussed the matter of statutory compliance of the Victoria Square restoration plan with regard to cycle vehicle use in victoria square with the Associate Minister for Ken to be earthquake recovery she informed me yesterday the cycleway is on the other side of the river around the pushed years etc now she also said that the widened pads and mrs. verbatim the wired and paths and Victoria Square are not designed for cycle use we 've widened on the other side of the river there 's a proposed cycleway on the opposite side of the river to Victoria Square adjacent to the courts they want to keep bicycles out of their meaning Victoria Square so they can go around the other side of Victoria Square the paths of Victoria Square are going to be widened that 's for safety for pedestrians and people with pushchairs and things like that thus for your awareness of your decision-making obligations and considering endorsing the Victoria Square restoration plan and the forum presented to you whether it 's provision for cyclists and cycle routes and or three Victoria Square I 've drawn the relevant measure of the crusher City reserves empowering Act 1971 to your intent to your intention finally and Chris kisling professor emeritus transport studies is unable to speak with me today in this deputation nevertheless to emphasize the wisdom of keeping cyclists vehicles out of Victoria Square he attached and he see as the deputation to the crash of city council endorses the recognition that vehicles bicycles are not legally allowed to use Victoria Square well it 's the area as defined in the city wizards impairing it I know that the precinct project when it speaks of Victoria Square extends back to a square north of the rubber but the city was lives empowering it when it refers to Victoria Square at south south east of the rubber confining cycle routes to outside the perimeter of Victoria Square as defined in Lee and preserves impairing eight is a workable solution nevertheless the safety implications of shared paths for cyclists and pedestrians cannot be overlooked from a traffic design perspective mixing slow casual walking and strolling with commuting cyclists that speed as downright dangerous any intend to keep cyclists to a slow speed using signage will not contribute positively to the ambience of the place and we 're very difficult to enforce wide pathways will inevitably become cyclists if they provide more direct routes condoning latrine 2shared pathways pedestrians and cyclists where the cycling component involves swiftly moving for which the park was originally when he means the square was originally designed pedestrians who is legally liable for deliberate planning blunders just one major injury or death to a child run down and what is meant to be an ultra-safe environment would rouse public opprobrium let alone some adverse comments from a coroner for encouraging mixing incompatible traffic slow walking hard-of-hearing elderly people devoid of an all-black split second sidestepping ability need to be protected also yep okay I appalling them for thank you n I 'm just ascertaining are you actually pointing out to us that you believe that the parts are being widened in order to be used for cyclists which would be be used I mean honest I 'm going by the plan as it 's on the agenda here 's a traditional depend on the agenda and relying on that wording and on diagram that shows cycle routes yes so so it would you then be of the view that if cyclists were prohibited from using Victoria squeeze through the reserves act then the past maybe perhaps might not need widely is that what of my deputation it 's just about that may be raised by someone else no it 's just the fact of cycle use of victoria square they 've vehicles hmm Phil tnks viewed irritation in because it clearly in the report to the issue around shared pathways was raised by a lot of people who who am submitted on the plane and I just want to ask you about your suggestion about where bike cycle works like the cycleway innovator combos because it is a major cycle way but it 's where you think the bike should go were you referring before to the path on the other side of the river and well that 's part of the big cycle way for the preset project as I understand it from from the Associate Minister the years that I guess we need to see where that is and the plan because it isn 't in this current plan that I saw it 's on the other side of the river yes so you 're really saying that that bike should really be taken out of Victoria Square and the the I mean it 's not for me to say I 'm just pointing the knee towards a frame we 're sure that 's what I wasn 't what your suggestion yes yes I mean I 'm not splitting with you either way over there because the time for public participation is finished but it seems that this legal meta hasn 't been addressed previously thank you all right look thank you very much in and I have to say that you know I wasn 't kind of expecting this as a as a deputation so it 's been a very worthwhile point to raise thank you very much I 'm rather familiar with that act because that it was the one that was involved with the stopping it well not stopping but prohibiting of a road being developed through hey to park and my father was very much involved with the prime minister at that time so and I knew that that legislation also sort of gathered up other areas in the park and lusted them in the boundaries um so that legislation is sort of part of my family to the table is much appreciated thank you okay be aware of it right right okay so um _"

    "text": "a public participation that I 've put Gary Moore after the after the as part of the dictation so if we could have the if we could have the turning the tables young people Sophia Sophia who could come forward I don 't know with a tie low whether you all want to come up together or whether you want to do want to come up as a group or do you want to yep so if you 'd like to introduce yourselves and and I think ten minutes with the two of you at the table that yeah thank you first of all I 'd like to thank you guys for having us here today and last night it was a really really cool experience to talk on behalf of the youth that we here down communicated with um for those of you who were there last night my name is Sophie and I 'm with the Christchurch Youth Council so we have a memorandum of understanding with you guys and so pretty much we get a youth voice and to the decisions that are being made and regards 'm the co-chair of youth voice Canterbury and we 're in network of all the youth councils and youth participation groups and Christchurch such as the Christchurch Youth Council pacific youth council and all those groups so what we angels a host of space four times a year where we can bring these groups together to work connect collaborate and support each other and we support our youth guides to connect young people to decision makers and offer opportunities for adults to engage with young people from our network came the collaboration between cyc pilot and the Christchurch City Council in the idea of turning the tables which you are all of our to last night so turning the table swords been we got to sit in your seats and the mirror and quite a few of the counselors came and set in the public gallery and we debated issues that we surveyed 250 young people and we got five top issues which were mental health having your say and decision-makers listening the rebuild youth friendly places and spaces and cultural diversity so I can cover a few of the mental health I opened up on this and we talked about the importance of mental health and that after the earthquakes the label was changed to stress family conflict and isolation from my enjoyable things and individuals and at the seriousness of suicide and it last year 529 youths took their own lives so working towards a loose the number so I got to talk about having a say which is really important to me and the main point that I made about that was unless you 're an out-there engaged young person like assets very hard to hear you 're saying council matters I did some research went to the website to see how your average young person would be directed to have their say and there 's a lot of things to click on and a lot of to read and a lot of jargon and the whole process could be more usefully we thought we acknowledge the work that the youth councils do to make the voice of young people heard a need for any way that makes sense to them but into the de young people if the decision makers aren 't willing to listen then that 's a waste of time and then we looked at the rebuild and the general consensus was at the rebuilders too slow and again how can we incorporate young people to have a say in these issues and that 's again getting us involved at the start and not in the middle of a conversation we are it 's too late to have much of an input until happening so the fourth topic was youth for any places and spaces we talked about how young people want places that are safe appealing accessible resource in youth friendly and you have a lot to say and often something will be planned and we 're asked later if it 's a good idea it 's it kind of improves what Sophie just said how about we get involved from the beginning because young people can add more value and it means a lot more to them to be involved in the whole process crush suits Youth Council are lucky enough to have young people on the Victoria Square reference group and issues getting involved with more things like that and we 'd like to see a change in that and we 're excited to be asked to be involved in the designing of the libraries just what also like to add that we are the ones going to have to live with the decisions being made now so I think it 's really important there we 're involved in these decisions because it 's going to be what we grow up with and it 's going to be our home and in the last one we talked about was cultural diversity and there the importance of having that is our duty are now right to stand up to groups and individuals being targeted and they 're also again having strong leaders of different ethnicities who are doing really really cold things to kind of get rid of this to stay in a stigma of racism yeah and so if you follow why we see or at youth voice underscore chucha on twitter you can see a live update of what was sued by all the young people last night it was we are interested in getting back together to discuss last night and write up any recommendations for you guys Mia does out even said that she would really like to see it happen a lot more regularly and that it was awesome and done in a more youthful anyway and we did want to say thank you to the mere deputy me and the counselors who did come last night I mean a lot to us and showed us that if you 've you really do care about the youth voice and we also want to say thank you for this open mic session we think it 's really cool and we really love for it to be promoted more to young people and you 'll probably see a lot more of us because I 'd like to see your voice Canterbury support young people to portunity to have their voice heard by you guys thank you son actually an idea that came up last night which I thought was really well actually it made me feel embarrassed and I had to tweet on it but and tweet a sort mayor of the Waimakariri District Council I was humiliated when a voice from the back of the chamber says that the Waimakariri district council sends three people three councillors including the mayor to all of the youth council meetings every month than I thought oh we don 't even send one so I think that 's probably something we need to remedy because it goes both ways doesn 't and as it 's a two-way conversation yeah and the second one was in relation to that annual planning process so and one of the offerings and in die keen and who 's sort of kind of sitting at the sidelines there I think might be a good person to just connect with before you leave the room but about how do we engage young people in our annual plan process and given that that will start next year probably in February with a you know a discussion document that will go out with a proposed annual plan and how do we how do we engage young people in that process it seems to me that we should hand that over voice canterbury because you engage with all of those other organizations a social media campaign amongst young people focused on particular issues and maybe a a pizza related conference I got the very strong message that you 've got to have a reason to go to something that 's a little bit more than come to a meeting so eaten meat is a good concept so does that sound like a that definitely sounds like something that your voice Canterbury would like to work on yeah I 've felt thank you for coming today because I wasn 't able to come last night I was farewelling some young young school students who are going to kurosaki one of their sister cities so what I wonder i 'm interested in the what you raised about suicide and particularly from the point of view of prevention and if you 've got any ideas or sort of suggestions that we as a city should be taking especially to support young people around they 're hot they 're all psycho what we call a psychosocial urea always or what we as a council should campaign that came out has been really really successful with the five tips to a good well-being I think it 's keeping it simple I went to a talk with a guy called Rob Gordon disaster psychologist and he was talking about just being there for people I mean and nowadays you know families have to work more than they probably did a while ago and it means that the children are kind of having to spend more time you know without their parents and I think it 's just really important to keep conversations going about issues like this just having someone to talk to just keeping it really simple though you don 't need intense therapies but just you know just people that understand and getting more promotion around the stigma of getting help and that mental illnesses are like these really embarrassing things in it you can 't get help because people are going to judge you for the way that you are yeah I think just a lot more promotion and just having those positive role models out there of people were doing rep doing well a month ago and she was at the end of her recovery and getting better and stuff and then she was so scared about moving on and having this new life and she 'd done so much work and then it just ended because she doesn 't know how to move on and how to to get a a good life thank you for those ideas concern i hopefully that 's helpful yani I just um just wanted to kind of get it feel if if there was anything in the city that young people really liked or anything that they really they could change they would change I don 't know I mean they 're young people are so diverse that I don 't think we could pin our finger on one thing that they really like I want to change the young people who live in lynnwood would would think something completely different to the ones that live in bishop day all the ones that live in the city center I think it 's a matter of engaging with those communities themselves I don 't want to speak last night there 's diversity of thinking around the table you know you can say that you know that it was there were all young people but you would say that the thinking was as diverse as around this table you know so it 's yeah you can 't have a single thing that says what do young people think yeah let 's ask him yep all right we 'll look thank you very much and we really appreciate you you know because we did put it on you last night it was the dick tamiya who gave me permission to use the word awesome and it really was an experience that that I hadn 't had in terms of this this room being taken over by young people and you know I just thought it was incredibly worthwhile and I 'm I 'm glad that you took the opportunity to come along this morning but thank you very thank you very much and we as accounts all need to think about putting people on the youth council all right team in the couple of the meetings but lately lately might be as she drilling a shoe that right if they could be at a time when perhaps the selection of counselors that could have teamed up magnet helpful so what can I leave that with you poor lane to sort of make some contact and to talk about what might might might work for counselors okay okay good thank you um or _"

    "text": "are you going to close the debate no well I 'm no actually going to put the amendment in a minute okay I had a question around plcs amendment that 's all in terms of of staff and the implications of it and the cost may be and no specific you 're on the safety okay right and the Christian I think okay dangerous precedent ok go for it well no I think it 's important people are voting on something we know we know about the safety issues and i want to ask the staff and probably term in particular in your professional experience with what counts lease has put forward it seems to me it 's pretty much based on what our attachments on page 262 would would this concept pass any safety audit sorry apologies there are one of two fundamental problems with councillor East 's alternative as I would see them and we have not had this independently safety audit it as a proposal so I 'll make these points from that point of view the the first and foremost problem is that what were actually a traffic stream to get to the bus stop but together until I said it was that a pedestrianised crossing rd yes but the the issue there is it is a combination of actually getting to that island in a in a controlled and easy way and so what one of our concerns about that is how could pedestrians would actually get to that I have a number of problems in terms of the overall layout of the corridor that would arise from this is that if you put a pedestrian Island of that sort in the middle of the corridor as a platform promontory like that I do have worries about 11 crossing behavior that this may well generate you are actually widening the carriageway they 're quite significantly from the proposal at stands the proposal stands is for better to meet or what a two-lane wide crossing of Manchester Street at that point I think from Council he 's proposal in front of you now that the tool and wide crossing effectively with the addition of the island there becomes really you 're crossing four lanes of traffic for a Barnes dance there which would have cross pedestrians over the street there one other problem with this is armed if you 're a pedestrian crossing the road they 're normally when you 've got a refuge island in the middle of the road in the middle of a two-way Road you cross traffic in one direction you expect them to come at you from the right and you cross over the island and you expect them to come at you from the left here you have the island asymmetric to the corridor and so you 're actually crossing into the road seeing traffic coming at you from the south from the right-hand side you then have the island there but then you 're crossing beyond it the robust is coming at view from the south and then suddenly there 's a vehicle lane on the opposite side that is in the opposite direction and so I think Stephin may be able to add to this in terms of some of the problems Wellington have had with manners more excuse me it 's a pedestrian cross and the dawn the its term looted to part of the issues of head around men as more and and well he turns round vehicles moving close to curbs and directions that had expected and partly she is also around ability to take evasive action when people do step out generally what they 've found is there people generally walk up to the curve and take a step off before they look I 've done all that video footage too obvious to understand behavior of people and what they find is people used to be able to walk into onto the road to a buffer zone be able to see what they 're doing stick it through a nice when the other side this you 've completed that is terrifying Andrew Andrews is a question and I want to speak on the debate are you as Christians minor questions that probably others are thinking of as well and I perhaps thought that um filme might have asked this one but the the cost of the proposal has put forward by Councillor East we 've had a number of speakers have talked about him long those investigations would take and then whether the outcome of those investing patient 's would in fact require further public consultation and what the overall time of the investigation and any subsequent consultation would be so cost and time taken to deliver what them counselor is to bring forward it would be pure speculation I think to as to what the change costs of the scheme would be to achieve the alternative arrangement counselor East is proposing between Worcester and cap and her efforts treat certainly in terms of consultation I think it would be the council would be obliged to consult again over that section of the Manchester Street proposals it does have implications in terms of achieving their continued traffic function of the street it has implications on that eastern side footpath it has implications on the levels of landscaping footpath provision provided one of the things it does have specific implications for I think is actually the proposal for the shared use facility to cyclists and pedestrians which was using that wide eastern side foot path to achieve the turning movements we need into her efforts cycle way there would probably reduce to in the order of three meters on that side there so the shared facility and the provision for local cyclists they would disappear we have no other reasonable provision within the corridor for cyclists at that critical point and so I think a number of user groups would expect to be rican sulted over that the other aspect and it 's probably more of a streetscape and environmental issue is that as I understand it the East frame development of residential there has been designed with that tree-lined boulevards on that eastern side to provide that nine metre wide buffer between residential properties and this busy bus think test vehicle street and so it make it changes the nature of the East frame develop and their expectation is towards going to love did you have a quick question with all of the reasons why this wouldn 't work does it work in Melbourne they have different traffic laws in Melbourne that if a track that those are the trans as as as I understand it all traffic is obliged to stop when a school buses there for instance when a yellow bus stops all traffic is obliged to stop so this is different New Zealand traffic laws and and so we would be we are obliged to design a scheme that works with you cheese in traffic laws it 's like just going back to the slow pedestrians you 've mentioned about this being an issue for pedestrians and encouraging dangerous behaviors that what this does in Melbourne um yes in issues with crashes have these these locations where pedestrians are moving to those central platforms so that some potential injuries as well and i haven 't dwelt because it 's not my area of expertise on the crime prevention issues but soon too rowdy is here sue could advise you over some of her misgivings about this in terms of the creation of this barrier island ok Stanley did you have a question yes so the buses will then have to come from the center back to the left hand side of the road to carry on the journey do you perceive that as being safety risk and we 're in how the traffic the other competitor on the road I do as I think I said earlier um the scheme design for Manchester Street is around simplicity maintaining a single center line for the corridor so if you 're a pedestrian crossing the road you know it 's broadly equal width throughout it and you sort of know where the vehicles are coming at you from if you 're going to cross the road there some of these arrangements if we just seek to treat this block differently to the others involve some very severe weaving maneuvers across the Wooster Street approach from the north which would effectively mean all traffic buses and vehicles alike would need to make very severe sharp turn to the east to cross that intersection to come south there if you were adestria in crossing from the east foam residential area to get to the central city you 're stepping into a row no traffic to your right and then sudden your vehicles coming at you yeah yeah very severe loss of alignment quite a few yeah lawsuits following it no you don 't have a did you have a question no could I just speak to the original motion and amendment and that is to say that I will not be supporting the amendment I think it 's dangerous I think it 's actually incredibly unsafe for part of a street to have a completely counterintuitive structure and that we would put pit require people in order to catch a bus to walk across to the middle of the street and then deposit them again in the middle of the street and I can just imagine the response from the blind community and the earthquake disabled leadership group about depositing people in a place where their first movements had to be into traffic and I cannot imagine why we would wish to inflict that on people for a moment I just cannot get with the concept of doing it if you 're going to do it you would need to have access above the street and to some raised platform and we looked at that on record and road and there wasn 't space so from a safety point of view I won 't be won 't be supporting the amendment and from a delay point of view I certainly won 't be supporting the amendment because i would like to get to the point where in terms of what we are doing in the central city we have a high degree of certainty so people can get on and do the development of science Emporium of the Trinity Church the development in the next block and the development further east as well that 's waiting to be done all of those things need to happen and need to happen fast in terms of the heritage buildings yes I am totally in favor of the reveal of the motion that we don 't have a bus shelter in fact in front of shanz Emporium or the Trinity Church these are two class one heritage buildings and we shouldn 't destroy the visual amenity by putting a shelter right and right in front of them I appreciate that so compromised and I think most things in politics are but I think it 's a sensible one and one that enables us to get this underway get using buses as well the idea that you have to cross in front of traffic to get to your bus shelter just defies logic and then the bus has to immediately go back into the traffic line also just defies logic so if we 've all now spoken what I would like to do is put the amendment first okay so going back to Dave 's amendment is seeking to buy i think it was signaled by paul actually there 's not much that ok well whatever that doesn 't really matter ok shall i put shellac can I put that those in favor please say aye those opposed it clear that lost does anybody want any division or you want a division ok division has called for have you got equipment that works or should we just do it by hands okay if you 're in favor just raise your hand one two three if you 're opposed raise your hand more than three sorry okay you 've got all that so three info 30 in favor of you run against can I now put do you want to opposed okay three teen opposed yep yep and now can I put yours fool you have a right of reply if you want one or as a user okay so your motion so are you sure we put that motion first and then all the rest of the stuff because there 's a small war and peace of motions actually so we 're just putting if Paul you got ahead it and some suggestions around importantly it 's into right right it 's just specifying you the use of the technology from the interchange but the bu you do okay do you want to put them all together yummy ok mark on your legs no no I 'm happy to date your advice so these motions are moved by Councillor clear water and signaled by councillor main team they go on for a hundred pages CA with web just because there are similar throughout 592 substantive amendments in terms of the message with checked with staff and so this one is just giving staff the authority it 's a multi tasking so start or just gonna quit today give a so moved for what the one about the measuring liters no let 's put them all together okay so moved fool so you can do it I 'll put those millions okay those in favor please say aye those opposed so carried right okay does anybody want anybody anything recorded Dave wants his name recorded it gainst right okay and is that a lot yeah let 's the infrastructure thing no no I know there 's more stuff but it 's the whole exit more that 's all the accessible to be one right right now and yoni would like his folk club against the rock so this was part a this was the report of the chairperson and then have you got more Phil we 've just been wrapping up that item clearly worth a record number of resolutions this has been an enormous amount of work for staff in turning the excellent consultation it 's been a real team effort and I appreciate the work that we got the collaborative efforts from Sarah too so I just particularly want to thank all the staff there 's been a thank you so much for your very hard work you can move on to something else now will be so pleased okay roading designations for the christchurch city plan page 288 and infrastructure transport and environment okay will you move yep Pauline seconds put that those in favor please say aye those opposed carriage and there 's one other item in the supplementary and that 's the App Center that 's the only one that we haven 't yet done in public okay _"

    "text": "Oh counselors I think there are some of the key challenges around the bus superstar are certainly about accessibility 24 bus passengers to the super site and also having a super stop attractive and I believe having it in a composite place so that in fact what has written the report is being legible that people who are whether they 're visitors or locals can understand exactly where they 'll go to a Memphis history to catch the bus so I think you know the challenge for us as a council is how we actually integrate our city 's bus routes with supporting infrastructure and part of that is locating the Superstock within existing infrastructure including some privately owned only and the thing about making this decision though I think the most important thing is that council keeps the passengers and their experience right at the center of this decision to me that is paramount if we want people to use the buses the stops and shelters must meet their needs public transport in fact is right at the heart of providing better travel choices for people to access our has been referred to the target is that we do increase bus patronage threefold and that 's going to potentially a lot of people it 'll be a similar increase to this increase we want to have in cyclin so that we have avoid excessive traffic congestion and that we manage their so I 'm actually going to put forward an amendment that and it 's basically on the lines that we have no bus shelter it 's a I 'm going to support the staff recommendations and an amendment I 'm going to put on flagging now is that we have no bus shelter in front of sharon 's Emporium or the trendy church um so and I think that that with the staff recommendations will allow the Superstock plan which has been fully consulted on and to meet the clear objectives and that is a super Stop and safe that it 's a dedicate that Manchester Street this part of Manchester Street becomes a dedicated public transport spine with the Superstock facility and is actually able to promote public transport use and will achieve that shift and mode the Superstock be barrier free so that all members of our community including people with disabilities can access it if we try and split up the stops straightaway that creates barriers particularly for people are referred to like people are blind or older people or other people disabilities and I guess is it council and being on council we really come to expect that when it comes to bus stops and shelters no matter where you put them the NIMBYs syndrome it goes into overdrive and it has over this however while I 'm putting them the amendment is I think that with the Trinity Church and shanz and pouring buildings I actually support the request that we not obscure the line of sight for those buildings so I think the amendment really provides a clear compromise between on one hand supporting supporting heritage but also ensuring that the super stop is in the best location and I think to around heritage we have to keep in mind that before the previous bus stop area on combo story that every bus in Christchurch stopped right outside the cathedral and it our most famous heritage building so like buses and trams were and still are there like people movers and they always have been in their part of Christchurch 's heritage and our social fabric and so the bus shelters that we decide on today for Manchester Street they can really become part of a new and attractive Boulevard the people will enjoy being there and I 'm sure that the neighboring businesses have already commented that they 'll be able to contribute to the ideas for that design and the possibility is really for using Christchurch 's the skulls their endless so as a council to we were a been accused of being slow to make decisions and public transport we 've added however we 've undertaken a full democratic and consultative process however if there 's not agreement today on the project within the scope of the consultation it will not only delay this project that will delay other accessible city projects and affect the whole city so I urge you to put the people who catch the bus enclosures transport system first in making this decision and let and we can get a butt about a bus super stop with shelters and people can also have a clear view of notable and noteworthy heritage buildings which been restored the for the future will be beautiful so I urge you to support the amendment and it 's a motion for sorry it 's a motion it 's a motion yeah it 's part of the motion it 's a motion and I think you don 't need if the council isn 't minded to follow the staff recommendation above just take that out and make it emotion yep yep okay that 's seconded by okay cigna by red okay right shall we ok so we 're debating the whole Manchester Street thing now and we 've got Phil 's motion on the table as well I 'd like to do the three minute thing if that 's okay just because some stage there was a nice warm day out like today just in case anybody want to know that ok so I 'm going to do the three minute thing no objection ok I 've got Ellie Andrew Dave far from ideal situation you know we all know that we 've got an amazing opportunity and the city and have done for a wee while now and it just feels as though we 're making key decisions and key design decisions at the eleventh hour that we 're dealing with issues that should have been considered much earlier and I believe in this case that more than one option should have been consulted on so that if this one didn 't stack up as it hasn 't in some ways then the need for consultation on the others wouldn 't wouldn 't be needed I acknowledge counselor clear waters of resolution but what will having no shelter in the spot mean for customers what will it mean for the customer experience to which she 's referred to am rightly so and I don 't know the answer to that question because I 'm not an engineer and I 'm not a public transport expert and I would like to know that before I can one hundred percent support what he is suggesting we aren 't engineers we aren 't clear to us that this process that this option is far from ideal now I understand the design team knew about the shams move a month before the panel here and so I 'm at a loss to understand why it was not addressed sooner I don 't understand either why in the last week that some of the people affected by this have not been a part of discussions or at least been consulted I 'm still not sure how I 'm going to support or what I 'm going to sport here so I 'd like to hear what the other members have to say or the other councillors have to say but I do feel as though we being put under pressure to make a decision when we shouldn 't have to okay thank you Ellie just just for the sake of clarity because I don 't like people voting without knowing these shelters the secant to remain so worst case remembering that this one has used used two percent of the time your shelter here and come out right okay good okay Andrew thank you I up there I support it with some reservations and we 've obviously had a lot of discussion in the committee have had a lot of discussion that I haven 't been party to and I 'm certainly happy to a point to take a lead from the committee as well because that 's where the greater amount of discussion has happened it 's a pragmatic approach it does the best we can to balance the the wishes of the submitters in particular the heritage group the heritage advocates with the needs of bus passengers and I guess I support this in the context of what I don 't support which is and I know Dave will probably speak to this in a minute but the idea of having the the bus stops in the middle of the road has already been discounted for a number of reasons and the illustrations that support it certain out spinning my wheels at all I mean what we want is an environment which is user-friendly which is still retained some trees and which is a good Boulevard type environment rather than something that 's guess I certainly don 't support anything that sees a need for further consultation one of the outcomes from the debate this afternoon must be that we make a decision which is capable of but implemented and we can get on with this to provide the certainty that a number of people have talked about so much so it 's certainty for the the bus network we 've got the bus exchange in place we 've got the new routes in place this is one of the missing bits of the puzzle so far that needs to be put in place as soon as possible certainty for neighboring property owners once they know what 's happening then they can plan uncertainty for bus passengers as well you know we want to make the the experience of using the buses and using the bus stops wherever there might be as good as it can be for the people that are using the buses with the aim of getting as many people onto the buses as possible so and taking into account all of the the various different things that we 're the effect on the the neighboring building owners and their uses and the overall environment yes it may not be ideal but of what 's been put in front of us I 'm certainly happy to support what 's on the on the board at the moment thank you Andrew I 've got Dave Pauline Tim Jimmy no and thank you look I 'm not going to support the recommendation up there for for a number of reasons I really feel as an elected member I 've got a duty to represent all alternatives and the opinions of people across the city so in the last few days I 've had a number of approaches and concerns expressed Murray the northbound superstock and the one between he referred and wooster these these concerns center primarily around trinity church and chancing and losing their visual integrity due to bus shelters and bus stops I 've proposed that mid street bus super stock and I 've put a diagram around basically explaining why what I have in mind look I respect the view of the transport engineers I 've met with Tim to disagree in the end and I 'm reminded really of one of our former colleagues Peter BIC he also often chucked out a quote that grated me most of the time but I think he 's pretty right now I 'm going to use it year the wisdom of the people far exceeds the knowledge of the experts so I don 't really believe that we 've consulted enough with affected people and it 's a for me it 's a bit like the natural hazards proposal with the consequences of the proposal have not really been well communicated with those that are going to be affected so in Christchurch you know we 're a city that 's been largely destroyed by the earthquake and subsequent demolitions and other we were in a position to do something quite different now here we as part of the blueprint we had this Boulevard Manchester Street it was going to be widened and that 's half the reason why a lot of buildings got the most because the street was going to be widened and and we get this bull of look overcomes the issues of the objectors and staff comments opposing it really center around the fact that there were a number of services and the in the middle of Manchester Street and trees couldn 't be planted well I 'm not perturbed at all with the snow trees planted in the Superstock we can dress this up with big tubs and flowers and whatever you like to to dress it up and I don 't see the need to plant any trees in there all the other and probably more pressing reason why it 's been rejected is from the subhead point of view with traffic coming on the inside of the bus super stock and people crossing the road directly into the bus super stop I 've passed around a few photos of admittedly it 's a tram stop and Melbourne and pedestrian access to the super stop is either at either end on the pedestrianized crossing and you can 't get into it other than a controlled pedestrian crossing access to it I don 't buy the argument of you know that the gated will the railing and could make it as the tractor or as unattractive as you like but I really believe that we need to be a little more innovative than the way we are with approaching the situation and I could live with with this option for the northbound and as staff are proposed for the inbound one so I 'd like to propose an amendment that a mid street we 've got out here in front of us today if I might be up there already event yeah we 've got it near on on the screen at a mid Street option yep for the northbound super stop by the northbound super stop the further catch another blow brother thank you Dave is there a seconder for that amendment Paul okay shall we debate that amendment it 's or shall we just in order to debate the whole thing okay okay we can do that by yep it 's out of the first one fails is literally go it 's an amendment the first one is emotion I sorry I 'm with you yeah okay next up I 've got Pauling you look for this a little round of work it 's been massive and but does I suppose landing on the council committee agenda it seems like it 's a southern thing that sex you mean they 're weeks and wait four months and the making we 've done it at the environment committee level we 've workshopped it and we 've really looked into this it 's been challenging I 'd like to thank the staff but also for rising to the challenges that were put forward by the submitters and for making changes so for instance allowing the right-hand turns when people requested that and also for embracing the new interchange technology and applying it to this stop and I think that shows that you 're thinking expensively it was quite a brain wave let just so that buses can be detected as they approach the stops and thus minimize number of buses the early one time I think the hearings panel recommendations have allowed to an amazing amount of collaboration for shelter design around the two Bay 's south of the shins and who knows what an amazing outcome the stops being in one place for as we call it user legibility and this option is Phil 's amendment purports will be a fair compromise to me it 's more about the shelter of obstructing those buildings than the actual bus stop particularly if we use this technology to minimize the buses I 'm guessing that this is probably not the absolute first choice outcome for the heritage groups but I 'm confident with this outcome will mitigate Lee concerns by allowing visibility of the buildings and while we 're on then I 'd like to congratulate the Civic trust in heritage New Zealand for the dedication to retaining and enhancing the little bit of heritage that we have left so this option feels amendment will allow these to be viewed and appreciated by all and he hard work appreciated as well the people waiting for the buses will have a shelter to the south the buses are kept together in one place for user legibility and once again thanks to everyone who 's in the staff you 've worked hard on this and just one among us I seconder could we strengthen their about the the technology from the bus and to change being built into this amendment to say that we use that to minimize the number of buses stopping you we 're possible you 're good with it yeah so you would wrap that up and feel well include that yeah thank you okay I 've got just before you I 've got Tim Jimmy Paul okay thank you um I still I would like to support the amendment but I still think that bus stop three should go north of worcester street the environmental demotion put the amendment or the motion amendment ism in the middle of the amendment puts it in the middle the motion our site okay but um the arguments have been interesting especially when i pointed out page 125 understand that shames emporium may not have been in the mixed in but certainly the Trinity Church was and he was absolutely not no no picture of it on that page which was a shame with regards to buses parking Cathedral Square and not impeding the visual amenity of the cathedral there the Trinity Church and with regards to people not being able to try and hard to find buses and Cathedral screw in the old days when you hopped off your bus was like trying to find a dalmatian puppy and a letter of dalmatian puppies all the buses were read but you managed to get off there because they were clearly marked by number and for a passenger or someone to find the airport bus in this area where there 's only a number of stops and the super stop I find it hard that they would find it harder to find that stop I know this it 's been very difficult and I think staff in Tim especially for coming back to me a number of times with some issues that I raised but I still think that that number three should go north to ensure that that the historic building and there are so few of them left in our city of its face it does not get a lot by packed buses thank you thank you attempt to me yeah I supported this one in the amendment in the middle yes a few feels like feels emotion okay yeah because my personal view this kind of three transport project is a key package of the in assets for City and all solar this very crucial to revitalize the economy of the CBD central city especially the we are all aware the first stage of the past interchanging has been open comments in the several months ago in the second stage public weba comments at the end of this year so this is reader project be aligned with the lease the new the pastor interchange so I can say that this kind of the party the transport project a HR is the life person to revitalize the economy of the central city but another wise or solar policies you know because it is the consultation is difficult to make every the person you know to KP is impossible no any other kind of approaches can make everyone ap but how to mitigate affected as well wheeler the crucial yeah so if the original in a proposal is the bus stop stop in front of the either the sense web mega diversely factor but to mitigate or the kinda if only the past stop in there the people to get on bus or get off the bus and go papi this one can minimize his the worst the candle of the effect yet para para absolutely i go with the tender the idea yes because if long-term we still need to consider because the pasta especially consider for the elderly the person or trustee or wintertime not be because no bus shelters theory no more or less kind of reverse effect father between the past the interchange and this the manchester SuperBass to start probably only one kilometer MRI it 's not not not too long not to know and also if a some passenger would like to take a bus know if we said that the i mean a heavy big family can consider in the past the interchange so this kind of situation so I supported feels the amendment regarding to this way thanks to me yeah thank you to me Paul I 'm going to support the amendment there 's a few things I want to was actually in Central City and we know that bus stops are hugely contentious and the reason why they usually contentious is because of the people that are waiting around the bus stops do damage to buildings block up doorways and cause issues that is the reason it 's let 's focus on no one can deny there 's so much statistics around it and I agree that we have to design a central city and an environmentally friendly way that actually reduces that antisocial behavior so I 'm a big supporter of it I also know that pre-earthquake we had a lot of issues in the center of city of getting people in there a lot of that was around parking and I do get very concerned around II can this proposed method of actually getting more people into the buses which is actually how can you get people on the public transport to be keep providing parking so that that sort of thing does really consume me also you 're getting quite concerned that we 're putting all this hard infrastructure in when we know that the future have a major transport interchange five minutes around the corner and that also concerns me that we 're pushing through with this super Stop amongst all this controversy when we 've got something the ema 's transport interchange just around the corner I like the button or the super stop and the center of the road because it actually centralizes the the patronage away from the businesses frontages which is where the main concern is we know that there 's only going to be maximum of 10 to 15 maybe 20 people at the bus stop at any given time so it 's not like there 's going to be crowds of people and we know that yes we try to get more people onto the bus but currently we have less than ten percent of the commuter population is she taking the bus so you know I have many many concerns so I 'm going to support the super stop for the scent of the road as per day cease diagram I think that should be investigated if it 's working in a place like Melbourne I think that obviously works over there so I cannot see why doesn 't work here and yeah so that 's where i 'll leave it but you know i got concerns with this current proposal okay rights chirps OH yani sorry yonni Jamie yep yep it started raining outside now oh I just I just have stuff to put up a photo I don 't know if they can do that and I wanted everybody my it 's not outside at the moment then the lights and full screen it um so so to me this is um you know this is a really important thing that we 're about to vote on and and and that is this since the earthquake we 've had huge change in our city huge change in our central city and huge change in our suburbs and one of the problems that we have as a council is we have to prioritize and a constrained financial scenes we simply don 't have the money to all the things that we would love to do and I see countless has proposed an amendment of and I can another 40 million to the project as the cost of the proposed amendment that we 're about to debate on top of the 60 million dollar project is going to go through so this is huge money and from my point of view one of the remarkable things about the city is that people have been really good in terms of transitional creative solutions to problems so actually there 's no need to do this now there is no need to spin the huge amounts of money that we 're spending on the inaccessible transport plan what are we doing interim straight nine protected trees are being removed for the sake of a super stock when we own roads that we haven 't even made decisions with right next door to the trees and we 're going to chop down nine protected trees for the sake of having a super stop a few meters away from where we could put it without having any effect on the trees I can 't support that we 've got I support public transport we 've got people in New Brighton we 've got for not gold plated shelters but just simple bus shelters to provide protection from the elements I say invest the money in those communities for those people rather than put it into a central city that we need to wait for 20 31 to see the benefits of this investment that 's a long time away the other concern I have we 're over engineering the city we 're mixing cyclists with cars with buses with heavy vehicles does anyone really think this is the best solution for the central city and a number of submitters made the point we 're trying to do too much on the roads without having a really clear focus so if we 're going to build safe cycleways make them separated that we 're not doing that we 're ducking in and out of the roading network with cycleways on-road off-road buses coming in it 's a disaster it will be a disaster in my view we 've got it done on Humphries drive and just have a lock at the way in which the cycle lane goes on to the footpath and the this is really comes down to we 're in a dynamic environment the traffic network we still don 't know what the final results are going to be we should be taking an integrated holistic approach to development and in the central city the best solution is to integrate these public passengers stops with things like the library with things like the convention center with things like the resident development next door like the lounges that we spend millions of dollars on in places like Rick Adem so why aren 't we doing it here when we own the land when we control the projects and instead we 're going to expect hoo-ha of putting on street shelters in a funnel point I want to make or two final points restinpeace the majestic theater what was the point in locking down that beautiful building for this and when you think about where the money could go this is someone that contacted me and paul yesterday saying that this this is what that putting up was because the budgets have been cut and taken off and this was work that was associated with it this is the reality of the choices we face around where we choose to invest money and my plea to you is think about these people that are putting up with conditions like this and fix their problems first rather than investing in gold plating essential city where we can do later when the domain demand and need so I 'm not going to support any of this project I don 't believe that this is the right approach into prioritization there 's much more work we need to do in other parts of the city there are a much greater priority in my view I appreciate what ya knees saying here and we consider the design is a hearings panel and we can put that to one side now and we 're talking about the location now which couldn 't vector into the to our decision as a hearings you know but I we 've got some brilliant staff we really do admire the work they do in working with Sarah and he can have been incredible but I can 't help but get get a not comfortable with where any of its dying I actually look at it means his Street nothink and all honesty if there was probably one block where I couldn 't think of a more inappropriate place for this it would probably be here and I almost feel that we 've come so far with us that then we can 't really turn their can we 've ended up with this enormous proverbial dog 's breakfast I want to move it forward I 'm also believer that you know the best thing to make is the right decision the next best is not quite the right decision but the worst thing you do is make no decision I think that is the case with with the accessible City the inaccessible city is he only calls it so my personal my personal view in a perfect world is that I think this whole thing around the super stops needs a rework that 's really where I 'm at but in a bid to move it forward the best of a bad bunch i think is what Dave 's presented here to explore go back to what the amendment of what the motion was originally to get rid of that third bus stop outside shanz so it 's all it 's all picking the best of bed bunches for me because I think deep down I don 't actually think this is the right place for it but I want to move it I want to be having discussions with property owners and to make this work and for not knocking over the majestic Churchill buildings that are leased and vain so I 'm putting the bus onto me into Street will will be the appropriate place for it but I just don 't know if it 's here but in a bid to move this forward also the amendment that fails are reluctantly very reluctantly support the motion but I 'm not happy _"

    "text": "yes there would be there will be a free clear pavement in front of the building but given if you need to place a shelter of some sorts in that area I believe that you could you could manage to integrate one without undermining the quality of the appreciation of the heritage building the pavement there will be six meters wide so that I believe gives you good scope to to create a a design of a shelter that would fit into that space without dominating without being so large or so visually obtrusive that it that it would actually undermine appreciation of the heritage building and that 's really what what we 're trying to achieve with with that with that area and that that that 's right between two sort of six gems yeah they could yep you got about a Brendan 's knowledge on that yes yes yeah there would be some time however you know where the total numbers of pedestrians and passengers waiting there yeah you know that 's why I 'm sort of hesitant about saying that in traffic terms yes we 've reduced that just got it got a couple we 're told a lot of the beginning is going to be this big Grand Boulevard with four lanes I just can 't remember quite exactly the reason why we pull that out I know it 's due to cross where it couldn 't be quite roomy Hamas the cost was to put their big Boulevard and he 's either 10 or 100 million i can 't remember was it right and then everything literally was proposed yeah but very early on the Manchester Street proposal was for four rows of street trees there on the proposals before council this afternoon in terms of looking at the cross section of the corridor there the problem with the four rows of street trees was because of the size of the tree pits that needed to be put in there to accommodate those unfortunately when we got into the detail design or sewer staff there unfortunately some of the underground utilities there 's water supply sewage stormwater and so on sat right underneath where some of those trees would have been so the modified design tree tree planting but it actually reduces the cost of underground utility or alterations I don 't have an exact cost for that but our estimate for it was something in the region of five to ten million dollars to achieve the underground utilities changes before we start with the scheme that you 're going to see so our view was that we took councils instructions of last May that there were 72 million dollars available for this first phase of access city programs and we were to stick within that budget and so if we went up with this scheme by five to ten million dollars to achieve those underground utility alterations we could not have done it within the the allocated budget for the scheme and so they proceeded on the basis of delivering the streetscape that we envisage but necessary modifications to avoid the costs running away with it second question is that you point out one of a negative subheading the bus stop and the second things because you 're always true existing right aways you 've got the proposed 12 car parks were a nexus to access your property the the issue really with with vehicle access there and a bus stop is more about the vehicles turning in and out between buses I a big vehicle which I dispersal here this is on the other side you had all year yes to existing vehicle access way through here right and then yep sorry I 'm is one you 've got only one vehicle at ease but you 're saying vitamin or retain so two cars approach now level 0 negative I understand the the red arrow on on option 1 the proposed scheme is the existing formed vehicle access that is there now that 's been an act grade car park and it was pre auth wake in fact if you look on google street view it was there in 2008 the arm we understand that the developers there may be proposing a second Vic ulor access we do not know that for sure but we understand there may be a second one there and it may be in that location were that to be the case then in concert with them there may other we 're actually making judgments on something that 's all they do well this part so if we for example take the side of that we what might remove the airport bus which is going to be going to number one over to the other side so you actually fleece buses on the south of this part here we sit have a to cart back see we actually have a bus stop the end just saying we couldn 't put it there because they 'd may achieve an axis way there so I 'm sort of bit confused ok so so we understand that their proposals includes off street parking that 's a different situation to the property south of Worcester where there is an access way there but it is at the very southern end something but we could say look for example we could put the number the number one bus stop which is at the front here over this side for to carfax yes okay so this is splitting the stops yep yes um well practice if I that 's the question quickly split stops we for that the proposal for these two super stop sees is his great legibility for passengers you know you get on and off a bus at a location and people know where they 're going to to catch the bus and then join a bus so this is going to be a whole new stops of it yeah I you most probably not make sure that Bella because it 's a whole retraining exercise of we have people to go anywhere a problem here is that work and and and this is this is really quite a firm issue with econ and that is clustering and legibility of the stocks a problem with splitting the stops is that we couldn 't do it cleanly across Worcester Boulevard there 's been quite a bit of discussion I think about the airport bus in some respects that would be the easier one to split out but actually it doesn 't just serve the airport the airport bus services other destinations of normal Metro customers and it just happens to have a degree of its patronage to and from the airport so there two passengers you go for your bus north of Worcester Boulevard others go for a south if we 're getting more people using buses which is what we hope for what we 're worried about is passengers going to the wrong set that stops and that actually they go to a stop south of Worcester Boulevard realize actually that the bussli really wanted to be on the is leaving north of Worcester Boulevard and then they negate to get to the bus because the things pulling in and so we 're worried about a road safety problem of people running about not and and so that 's the idea of actually having nice clean legible stops in a cluster of both sides of the corridor the last the last I want us ask you for comment on is the future of public transport and how they 're going to look and even three years time are we spending a lot of money on hard infrastructure that could become quite irrelevant in three years time with the driverless cars over and all these other things that are coming on it and use the bus every day myself I think what we now have is a quality of interchange here in this city which we can be proud of is finally the type of airport calm cause star facility that we 've promised people and is actually there now we want to replicate that on street and as a think we 've set to council previously achieving a three-fold increase in public transport patronage and cycling in the central city is not an optional it 's not a icing on the cake it 's absolutely critical to achieving congestion management in the central city this central city is attracting a lot of new business housing activities and so on they are going to generate if we don 't get more people on buses and bikes something like an extra seventy thousand vehicles a day on central city streets so we 're seeking to accommodate the increased activity by improving choice and giving people the choice of being able to use buses bikes and walking and so that we can actually manage could I be there is any siphoning from the racial and here 's what I 've got I 've got rare Pauline Jamie Tim you 're at no there was a really slow cooling I 'm just still going back to the technol technology that with that you guys have etched onto that that 's being operated and the bus interchange so why can we not use that to make sure that there 's never three buses there well shouldn 't it be possible to a degree it almost does rom because it but the way the interchange works is there shouldn 't be a bus is coming out they should be being released or we 've tried to do is to say the worst case scenario that the worst case scenario is you get a cluster of two buses coming right okay well it makes quite a big difference then that there 's a very small likelihood that they will be three of us is the time thank you okay you 're right Pauline cool Jamie um why given that it 's too hard for people you know if we had one of the stops further north and people get out given up the crown owns the the east eastern side of the Manchester Street assassin at least frame there why couldn 't we just locate both of the super stops in their block on the same so you have to cross the road to catch the earth knows you 've got the north and south so sorry Jenny how does it work we 've got instead of having the southbound one block over and the north one block down you just have them in a more appropriate block so this super stops one South one north on either side of the road depending on which direction the eye is in the northern block so with the northern one located well literally the other half of this super stop is one block above what I tell you you 're doing this way I 'm not switching anything I 'm saying just for them but no no I know sorry it won 't stop just the same that 's the same same instead of heading northbound on one side and southbound on the other why not just have them both be was looked at very early on and any fact that was the original proposal and that the idea was maybe to have some form of central platform within the corridor the problems with that were and we probably should have realized it earlier but one of the problems with that was is that we were then expecting pedestrians to cross from the footpaths on both sides of the street to get to a central platform to get to the buses and so are worried with that was pedestrian safety getting to those central islands we need to really manage the speeds and flows down there but the real problem with that sort of idea is visually impaired pedestrians because you know they rely on the buses and so they 're call all along is get straight on a bus from upper path you know not having to cross traffic to get to it is that possible well if you were hitting north wouldn 't you be on the northbound side and if you 're hitting South you just be on the southbound side yeah but it that was the idea actually put the thing in the middle of the corridor and for a number of reasons which are outlined in attachment 10 unfortunately we came down against that it was a we thought it was a great idea otherwise it wouldn 't hurt you but actually as we started to work through the detail of it we started to undertake safety audits of it we just thought no this is a this is a non-starter we just cannot do this kaskus seeking a new image yeah um so with this revisit and the I guess take two on how this is going to look you 've engaged with the you know the the business community that had some opposition around this have you got them on board with us it we believe this proposal would enable the findings of the hearings panel to actually take effect and that is whatever ship form of shelter goes in here now that we 've put up forward a traffic proposal to re manage the stock would then enable those discussions to take place in a positive frame work around that where we 've we still believe that there is a great design solution out there that that can be achieved in concert with those posts of it so you think this proposal 207 213 shanz and prime Trinity troops they 'll be really happy with us we hope so thank just I guess in part follow him from what Paul has suggested and also what couldn 't just suggested if we look at the page 125 of the separately circulated attachment that 's the original picture that went to the hearings pinner with regards to the shelter full style I believe that 's correct isn 't it so there 's no picture of Trinity Church anything in that original picture so it was quite a surprise I guess and it 's not surprising that the shelter once you take into account the Trinity Church it said with the original shadow is thrown out we have a stop north of worcester street now on the same side as the northern boundary so there 's an existing stop there so if we could bring out the picture which has one two and three on it with regards to three than the Blue Bus shands important was right behind it so if they 're so we are talking about taking out the shelter from the left-hand side of chance a chance here 's no shelter whatsoever in front of it so if their number three the blue bus which is the airport bus which only arrives twice an hour was to use the existing stop there for no consultation I believe would be needed and maybe drinking and clarify that then that would clear the site up and for the vision to the public of these to start buildings you mentioned before regards to a loading zone to be used or could be used by trinity church etc which will be available from 7pm between 7pm and 730am f trinity church were used as it had been prior to the earthquake and you are running an event the essay at seven thirty at night if you 've got access to lie down from 7pm i 'd say your chances are actually running your successful have been starting at seven thirty would be zero so therefore I with regards to debt to look at the viability of the operation of that and what it 's going to be proposed for but i 'm certainly in favor of moving at number three to the other side but in part of that don 't you didn 't remove about nine trees because you haven 't got a bus stop in this current plan yeah yes so um it 's the devisee battle there 's no shelter and and they said i would we previously discussed the airport bus and we 've used this generic term airport bars it 's not just used by Airport passengers it 's used by other metro persimmons doc groaning zone a hundred made it over 80 meters up the road so you hit your commuters getting off 80 meters up the road I you know if people have booked the tickets right round the world and they 've got here and they justified whether I think this was answered 3 full on stairs well question though wasn 't that script it 's all right welcome we 'll come to it I mean clearly there it one there is no existing bus stop and they 're redesigned and there is now but there is no and in the redesign and you actually take out the whole Boulevard concepts for that chunk in order to put one bus in there yeah yes so so one thing they would have to happen would it be another section 339 process around the shelter for their stopped because these guys to stand we chose the right next door yeah because the people that were using stop number three actually staying on the shelter why stop number one because of social I frequency they can tour the three bays are effectively using a shortened shelter if it more efficiently okay I haven 't_''_1190.08 got any more question people I am County all right dad info so when you look at the traffic plan and you know we 're in a dynamic environment with the blueprint and we now know that for example the South frame is no longer the cycling and pedestrian praying that it was supposed to be and I got you and thank you for providing the kind when you look at that plan you see quite clearly a few fundamental floors and the design which is places like gloucester street actually are not the most sensible route for buses to be going on and armor street art because gosta sure it gets cut off at columbus tree whereas armor goes straight through so I 'm just kind of really want to understand whether we 've just done a whole big planning exercise on a document that was created nearly two and a half years ago that doesn 't reflect the modern reality of what 's happening in the central city which is you know we 've got a lot of office development happening on the west of the square around Durham terrace where people will be working we 've got very little residential on the eastern frame at the moment and more fine-grain hospitality having a lot of Manchester straight which will kind of signal to me that that 's not the priority for a bus passenger stop so at the moment so I just I really want to understand yeah how you 've got to this up the boyfriend has changed and you know whether you can considered how future changes to the transport network our future proof through what you 're proposing most of the key traffic changes were signal through an accessible City and they were extensively consulted over at a time some of the local issues here around say for instance switching Gloucester to our mastery areas you have the margaret Mahy family playground that 's going to be going in immediately north of our monastery that wouldn 't be a great street to make it as a key traffic stream so the focus has generally been on her effort and lost the streets for those east-west distributors but with the main distributor chouest distributor streets fell to the south sanaa suffered Jim streets which we were discussing earlier almost from the outset Manchester Street has been seen to be the key north south bus street in the central city and there 's a very good reason for that because right back at a time share an idea one of the main pieces of feedback we had on public transport in the central and activity coming through Colombo street in a very heart of the retail precinct and so the objective all the long was to try and lift passes out of a very central core of the city that 's given us the advantage of putting cycle routes in and slowing it down there so we believe that the Manchester Street proposals actually do lock in a substantial level of public transport and infrastructure investment on this corridor which is good news for development of this corridor both sides of it commercial a mixed-use development on the west side and primarily residential development through the East frame on the eastern side all those proposals assume this is going to happen and this thought therefore we believe this provides certainty okay so um so basically we can 't change the transport plan that 's we can 't change the bus roads but say one of the ideas that we 've had is we want free public transport in the central city and some of us want up for the entire city would that change where you put the super storms but people didn got on the bus they could take it to go anywhere within the 4 f 's um I don 't need to change there 's a basic principle that what we 're trying to do is to achieve broadly a five minute walk time to most of the key bus stops in the central city there are two main super stop supporting the interchange that 's the hospital and here the hospital gives access to Metro sports and all of the increased activity were expecting around that health precinct there this gives great access as we 've explained in the report to the northern part of the core at large residential development in the Eastern frame there the Performing Arts precinct the new library and so on if this wasn 't here anywhere on Manchester story if basically you couldn 't pick up a bus on Manchester Street your next stop is kill more so you know it 's a big walk between the interchange and kill more Street so it 's a balance it 's um yeah I 've got Dave and then Ellie and then I 'm going five-minute coffee there is a tea and coffee out there but you 're not allowed to leave until you 've finished questions and then we 'll come back and debate it yep you 're a lot of question to fill yep but I 've got Dave Nick 's thin le it 's a question Dave okay Ella you have yours for gabe 's doing just kidding yep do you want me to ask now yeah yeah okay and we 'll compete the newest ancient of two buses or two percent about food shop my understanding is that the hearing that the figure that was floated zere in p cow was 38 buses no I the I think the numbers thank you sorry just to clarify the numbers on the buses so we since the OT really met we 've met come back and look to the bus timetables to understand the likelihood of that third baby in use and a couple of models there 's not a succinctly of looking at it but basically if you were to observe a bus moving at Manchester Street we think that given the London random platoon the buses one in 50 of those times two percent you 'll see three buses in a movement but of course buses dwell at bus stops after 10 passengers and reload people and we think that surely the dwell time of those three bus stops the amount of time that that third will stop will actually have a bus way and will be about ten percent of the pcap so about six minutes subject to depend on how many people again on but we 've got into a bit of detail and assume how many people get on with Metro cards vs pay in and things like that so about ten percent of the the peak hour that third will stop will have some broth person and what the killer timetable he 's about 27 northbound in the peak l27 and that third bus stop so 27 buses moving northbound on Manchester Street in the peak hours in total that 's told whether they out the number of buses that will stop with the depends on the allocation so of course if I 'm the third boss bus is already partly I 'm going to pull into that third bus stop know what I 'm saying through our modeling is that will occur be a bus pulls into that third bus stop about ten percent about six minutes in the pinko but give me a number sorry sorry what 's a what 's a question food bus stop in PK six minutes yeah how many my mess isn 't grateful you are the school suit meds yep how many buses will pull any power will be pulling into that third bus stop um just roughly i would say about five buses that 's great thank you and i just wanted to ask is it usual in a situation like this not to have had a level of consultation with those who are directly affected IE the trinity church with the buzzer the events and so forth shanz with the access to their building is it usual not to have had a degree of consultation i 've heard you say i hope so when asked other businesses happy so that 's my question as as usual we listen hearings panel on august the eleventh and further submissions from the submitters last Thursday at ITE committee at that committee the proposal that we have before council this afternoon we we hadn 't thought of you know they they they they they expressed their concerns about the access in front of the buildings and so we 've been working hard in the meantime since I te committee last week and council today to assure ourselves before we propose this to councillors this afternoon 's a possible resolution to this issue that we 've needed to investigate with third-party traffic engineers we 've had looking at this week is this actually a workable solution we believe as of some work that was concluded yesterday afternoon on this that this is now a viable solution for us to propose can I just confirmed yet we were absolutely in discussions with the Trinity Church and heritage to us and through the consultation through the preparation in the material for the whole consultation process and and so we were talking to them about the locations of bus stops and locations of shelters and once went out for the hearing about the location of the shelter we actually withdrew them from console and with them we let that process tech over but we loot Lee had dialogue with them over the past six months about the fact that I Bush shot stop was proposed to go in this location and how they wanted that amended or redesigned and we did actually pull back from a bus stop and a shelter in front of the shams building and however we were taking a wee bit by surprise when sorry in front of the Trinity building we were taking a wee bit by surprise when Sean 's relocate because that happened very very quickly right ok I 've got Dave and then fill _"

    "text": "I 'm just in terms of the hospital car park the new car pack that goes there provides how many k-pax we 're not sure final number yet working closely with them and that 's part of the analysis we 've done here and some of these changes is to enable them to get good access to the replacement building it 's quite likely that where the probably exit the previous access was wholly off of that antiguos tree these proposals would lend themselves at least to a second access from some massive street which works better with the traffic network not instead of but probably as well as thank you any other questions on Durham Cambridge clean oh no you 've missed a chance on it Joker it go great should have got before I mentioned it just a minor folk thank you still have some significance the Presbyterian Church sold land there too Sarah I think there was an undertaking given that the stone keen as a memorial to the or commemorating that site you know by the deans and others would be keep is that still the proposals before council this afternoon include the widening of Chu industry at that location and so as I understand it negotiations are taking place between cdhb and Sarah over the use of that land so if that is an undertaking with in that then that would be as much affected i think by the outpatients facility is on road works i think we probably have to get back to so this is between Sarah and the presbyterian church is not really are doing you mean leave san andres site is that yes yes that that 's that that very much is a conversation between Sarah and CDHP you 've heard that Angus okay I just just just what Brayden said there was it down there roadworks Asia fit that issue so says bit more unless he actually did development that affects the monumental river yeah you mean the monument the key and the fiddle yep so it 's between who 's a CDHP and Sarah and Sarah and that can voice it as I understand it and see the cdhb proposals for and outpatients in that area will will be located on the northern part of that triangular site and that currently isn 't affected by the schemes that are in front of you and neither is affected by the negotiations between Sarah and the Ministry of Health and cdhb for the purchase of lentil soup stock so isn 't affected by anything so we can say open today yep silk stores in terms of the planets do for you it 's it stays in its between between the Ministry of Health cdhb and previously importance Kendra duty now I 've done my duty I think it 's significant here to Jordan right anything else on Durham Cambridge Danny when are we gonna make decisions about Oxford terrace because it does seem weird that we 've got a whole intersection that has just said well just might just have to finish Oxford territory jet coming the proposals before council thus afternoon include the intersections of Oxford terrace with hagley avenue and rickety nav there and also a small round about proposal at the top of it in the bag ticular street the reason for that is to accommodate that the future outpatients facility that people could pick someone up from our potions do a u-turn there and basically it serves all the moves there that bit of oxford terrace between those two points is a matter that sarah are looking at as part of the avon river precinct proposals again those would be in consultation with cancel and cdhb they 're not part of the proposals this afternoon so we own the road where the road controlling authority so why is sarah doing its part of it open with a preset because it 's not in the net that we 've given them 20 come forward angus just maybe stadia so how come you get a road as part of a band most recent good question so they did on the original blueprint that that that was kind of just kind of grayed out a wee bit yeah it 's been left there part of the reason why it 's being left out of these plans as we see that actually that presents a huge opportunity to link the two sides of the hospital the new proposed eight patients in we were waiting until the cdhb were in a position to really inform the design of that before we integrate our sale we it 's the full an accessible City team which is a joint collaborative team between counsel and syrah and so it 's not we just lead in the discussions if you like it 's we understand fully into your rod and it will remain your rod and the traffic resolutions for any changes will come before you in due course but it 's not today but it 's not like yep well is it closed it 's not closed and it 's not proposed to be closed and as soon as we have a design a great concept design degrade will obviously bring it before you thanks thank you sir sorry second so so the functional requirement for that role just in terms of where we started for in design brief it is just as to support legibility and connectivity with the existing network so there in terms of whether it 's two way or one way we haven 't made decisions on that it certainly won it lends itself very well to a drop-off location for the hospital hospital activities and we 'll certainly taking that approach for no description through these these changes without your be acutely aware that so I mean absolutely people disabilities or people that you know may have injuries that want to part was I can 't see any way which we have accessibility for the memorial how do they get there so the presently if you want to get vehicle activity or vehicle access to the earthquake memorial and from the West you would head down to him street you would turn left up and durham street on the new section of one-way traffic and then left into oxford saris and they 'll be provisions for disability disability parking that 's my understanding or designs i 'm a final yeah okay thank you are there any other questions on Durham Cambridge if not I 'm taking that as okay unless somebody 's got amendments that they want to tell us that though okay so Manchester Street moving on to mantis running games you want that outline where you 've gotten much on the mystery of it because I think right so the key submissions made on the Manchester Street proposals were some concerns from central city businesses and developments about proposals in the draft plans to prohibit southbound right turns into armed our street casual street and high street so there were some significant concerns there raised by central city developers over that and so the reason for those changes being proposed in the first place were to maintain bus priority through the corridor subsequent detailed design work around the functionality of the corridor have actually led the design team to consider those submissions and so before council this afternoon we are proposing that those existing available right turns into our mouths street and into casual street will be retained as they were previously so submitters have been informed about that proposal we 're proposing that high street connection with Manchester Street would still remain left inlet left out as we were proposing it because that actually arm you 've got that very important right turn immediately south of there for Manchester Street into Litchfield Street which gives vehicles access right turn into the news more than access to the to the interchange so it 's just really too close to Litchfield Street for an order for us to have a second right turn into high so those were the primary submissions on Manchester Street apart from the issue of the northbound bus super stop located between Herefords Street and Wooster Street which has been the subject of the discussions and presentation ite committee last Thursday submitters came before committee over that and in fact was the subject of section 339 local government act hearing over the shelter proposals themselves which was considered by the panel chair by councillor golf on the 11th of August which found against for optional designs for the shelter structures themselves at that location so madam chair and turning to that matter then in in the committee 's recommendations to cancel today of last Thursday committee asked us to come back to Council and to inform you about the alternatives for staggering the super stop in the opposite direction so I just wonder if we could have those slides up now please thank you so attachment 10 to the committee papers today was optional assessments that were undertaken in to where we located a super Stop on Manchester Street we haven 't actually got a big search area to find suitable location for a bus super stop on that corridor the core services come out of the interchange they turn left up Manchester Street and two of the core routes that 's the yellow in the orange line then travel out to the east and northeast by of Gloucester and so any super stop located north of gloucester street would fail to service two important core frequent bus service routes similarly locating a super stop anywhere south of Herefords street would be a limited value given that you are getting very close then to the interchange the general objective has been to try and get a decent bus stop in the middle of Manchester Street within sort of 500 meter intervals of one another so the search has focused on the section of corridor between Gloucester and harappan streets I think there was a question no you finish and mail it thought I 'd go work the proposal before council today is to stagger the super stop and again attachment ten goes through other alignment and arrays for the delivery of the stock facility having both of the slops opposite one another on a block at various locations a mid corridor Island arrangement which was suggested quite early on and was rejected again at committee last week which we 've also looked at but the primary recommendation from committee last week is that we should brief council this afternoon on the stagger arrangement which the proposals contain which is for the northbound super stop to be on the block between Worcester and he referred Street which places it outside the the buildings that have attracted the submissions and objections to that so that is Trinity Church sorry place trans emporium on that site and other commercial developments to take place between Mexico restaurant and the trinity church and the southbound stop being on the opposite side of the street on the other side of Wooster Street so we have proposed staggering it that way and committee asked us to go through the pros and cons the proposal and the advantages which we 've generally shown in green are there on the slide that members have before them now so this is a sketch form of the main scheme proposals that have we have before you and so there is no one binary issue in this there is no one issue that says that single matter says it has to be there what has to be in the opposite direction most of this analysis is a combination of factors and we 've looked at the balance of advantage and disadvantage with each scheme so in our view the key advantages of the proposal is were showing them are summarized on that slide before you there the chief disadvantage of it as is shown in number eight at the base there is that the proposal as existed placed the stops and the shelter outside of those sensitive heritage buildings so the alternative which is slide number two is as we were asked effectively then puts the northbound stop north of wooster street and the southbound stop then conversely switches to opposite those heritage buildings and on this he referred Street and again so if you look at the diagram there right hand side south left hand side is north again as I stressed earlier there is no one single issue that says you cannot do this however there are combination of factors there that we believe deliver a sub optimal solution to the proposal you have before you this afternoon those are the highlights of some of our concerns about the alternative option there some of them are about streetscape and the planting of street trees and the achievement of the pleasant urban environment some of them are more about safety road safety issues and the functionality and the operation of the corridor I I think the chief issues in Road Safety terms which we 've been conscious of and nervous about is that staggering it in that arrangement means that you have a wider corridor to cross over Manchester Street compared with the preferred option particularly their south of Worcester and so the proposal before council today contains a proposal for Barnes dance countdown crossing there much like that outside the interchange the extra width crossed second per meter extra to cross for slower pedestrians crossing would add time into a Barnes dance at that location it begins to mitigate against bust efficiency not a huge issue in its own right but it is a factor other factors there are would be if we place the super stop on the western side of the corridor between worcester Boulevard was too straight and gloucester street we are concerned that there is an existing formed vehicle access there which may be used by a future development to access the site there there is a scheme board on site at the moment for development there we understand there may be a proposal for a second vehicle er access on that block to premises there these are pertinent matters for any section 339 hearing mainly about access to premises are worrying road safety terms there is if we have a one or more Vic uhler accesses located at the same location as a super stop that you would have vehicles turning in and out amongst buses on the bays at that location and in some shape or form they would on the footpath and waiting for buses there the other issue with that is is because two of the core services turn right onto bluster we have to be conscious of the fact that we don 't want the bus stop too far north on that block and to close to gloucester street because they 've got to get out of the bus stop and then swing a right turn into gloucester street there so i was trying to think earlier about in a comparable example of what that might look like we have a right turn now for buses from colombo street in to chew and street to access the new interchange all the north-south blocks are about a hundred metres everywhere in the city so the equivalency there would be a three block a three-bay bus stop on colombo street immediately south of chew in the street where buses are pulling in there and then we 'll be coming through to the signals almost immediately in front of them and they 're making a right turn into chewin street it 's quite a demanding move for drivers to we would have to rephrase the bus and traffic movements there every time we introduce an extra phases i think is shown on the diagram there you get a further loss of bus efficiency on the corridor so to try and sum up all of that counselors and if we go back to the previous one please to try and sum up all of that I 've spent 20 years being a road safety engineer and a safety audit air and I 've been out to the scenes of road crashes in accidents after they were they 've happened we do forensic analysis of what led to the accident in all my career I 've never found an accident that had one single cause it was a combination of driver speed inattention someone running in the road in a whole combination of circumstances and what you try and do when you try and overcome it is to reduce the level of human error everyone makes mistakes using the roads with other driver a pedestrian or whatever everything we try and do with highway design and that is the case with and achieve simplicity what Manchester Street does is achieve absolute consistency there is a single center line all the way down that corridor so when you cross the road as a pedestrian you get very good idea of where a vehicle is coming from and you 're not seeing any late swings and maneuvers towards you and so there 's the simplicity in that my worry with the alternative that you see before you here is as I 've said not one of those factors is a single binary issue that says we cannot do it what I worry about there is that we have seven or eight factors then in our view mitigate against that being the preferred outcome for the location and the arrangement of the Superstock there so to come to the third and final slide promise there 's only one more so um we are very conscious and we were very concerned that when we came to committee last week we hadn 't done enough we hadn 't done enough to satisfy the concerns about the heritage buildings on Manchester Street and we listen to what those submissions and we 've gone away to try and come up with some way of addressing their concerns when we briefed committee on this last week what we were planning for was both of these super stops to lead the work on a simple lead stop arrangement in other words the buses come into the stop they roll through to the front stop and then they they all come in behind it what we then looked at was could we come up with a smart stop solution so we actually looked at the way the new interchange is working so when a bus comes into the new interchange on chewing street it gets detected by loops there and they actually direct a driver into a stand in the new interchange and we thought well why can 't we do that here well I can 't we actually reduce the number of buses going into that northern Bay and so if I could then Claire or someone could you click the slide please oh Thank know the should have been animated chicks anyway nevermind right thank you right okay all is we would detect buses coming up Manchester Street in a similar arrangement to what we 've put in at the interchange so as the bus come somewhere near here referred street it gets detected instead of directing it to the northern Blue Bay there and our thanks to miss metha more actually produce this long section is one of the submission plans last week we thought well how about if we actually made the middle stop the lead one so we actually direct the majority of buses into the yellow stand the middle one there and then any second bus comes along gets directed into the southern stand which is the red one there and the third one the northern one is the least used of the three now our analysis of bus frequencies and passengers and so on there suggests to us that we would for ninety-eight percent of the time we 'll never get more than two buses in a platoon coming out of the interchange coming around the corner this is a first stop after the interchange so for ninety-eight percent of the time we 're the period of a peak hour it might be 10 six minutes within the peak are ten percent of the time that the third Bay would be occupied so our proposal here is to introduce a smart stop where we 're by the majority of buses first get directed into the yellow Bay in the middle secondly to the southern Bay thirdly to the northern Bay so what that does is it reduces the pressure on the northern Bay outside the relocated chan 's Emporium well clear of Trinity Church and therefore as a consequence reduces the need for the passenger shelter which is east cans concern is that passengers should have shelter up to the door of the primary buses they 're using so what we 're to be doing here is we 're lifting the doors of the buses south from where they otherwise would have been not through all of the time but for the vast majority of the time so we believe this is a snart solution to it it uses a bit of technology but actually even if the technology wasn 't working the driver first you will then occupy the southern stop then you will only finally occupy the third stop the other two are full which is a small proportion of the time so if we could just click it once more the slide so in pure traffic terms what that means is that it reduces the need for the shelter facility outside the sensitive environment immediately in front of shanz Emporium no I but so I 've we 've just merely done this to illustrate and the hearings panel already concluded that a shelter of that kind will not exist there it will not be placed there and any design would be in consultation with the frontage owners there what we are simply showing they 're using myths Netherlands long section there is how this solution might significantly reduce the impact of not only the shelters but stationary buses in front of that building there 's one other tiny point with it and that is in the resolutions we were planning to use what would have been the least used southern stop for a part-time loading and servicing bay there I up could have been available to frontage premises and so on we understand through our colleagues at syrah that the trust the Heritage Trust would have liked a servicing bay somewhere out I 'd that the shands Emporium and the church towards the northern end if we make the northern Bay the least used at the three that resolution could deliver them a quieter hours out of ours servicing facility there which will only serve them it would serve all the premises on that block but would actually give them the access they need given that we understand they 're still looking at what purpose what how they would purpose that building thank you so potentially a number three there might be no shelter it I think probably that point where i would probably hand over to brendan smiles to give you some advice on how that might affect the heritage buildings _"

    "text": "so we 're on two floors 20 their report of the two-person of the infrastructure and environment committee these are slides writing they 're going to do right and what is going to suggest since there 's quite a big army of people if not all the counselors and is that we actually do Hospital corner and Durham and Cambridge first and then come on to Manchester said okay since I suspect most of the controversy will be around Manchester Street do you want to do you want to come and do the hospital hospital corner and Jeremy Cambridge 's I don 't think there 's a great deal of debate about this is there no okay so so a quick intro of these two 610 like madam chair good afternoon counselors as you 've just said madam chair arm the the report in front of council this afternoon contains proposals for 3x major accessible city projects under the phase one cost share agreement between the council crown and the New Zealand Transport Agency council approved some changes to that program around May of last year and the three schemes and a half million dollars the first scheme in the three is is Hospital corner and those are the final works around had the Avenue chew and streaked with the new super stop proposal there some assets street and a wide range of streetscape enhancements around that area the second scheme is Durham Cambridge terrace enhancement that has a value of around 14 million dollars and that is generally an enhancement of that corridor achieving conformity with the adjacent Haven River precinct proposals and includes a short section over to weighing of Durham street between Litchfield street and chillin street in order to provide improved access to the new car parking buildings of Litchfield street and to maintain access to Oxford Terrace premises the third scheme which I think will come on to shortly are the proposals for Manchester Street and I 'll summarize that from members shortly so firstly before perhaps we get into the details of those are just introduced some of the team who are here this afternoon to answer questions about that I 'm but my right here is Stefan Thomas unit manager for transport rebuild and the community office Aaron are our crime prevention through Environmental Design specialist who 's been helping us with some of these schemes Brendan Smith our heritage team leader is available to provide some advice on the heritage issues and Manchester Street a little later and also abilene with us this afternoon yep Brent pcs here for legal advice around some of these matters and also here is Angus barge from Sarah who is their principal transport planner for accessible City so just coming back to those first two days and welcome Jeannie Jerry I 'm jelly who asked me not to introduce and Jenny 's been dealing with all of the consultation which is where I 'll start consultation for these schemes was approved by council on the sixteenth of April and Jenny led the consultation team for these three really important schemes between the end of April and the end of May and we had 102 submissions across these three schemes 66 of those submissions commented on more than one of the three projects before council this afternoon so the reports before council this afternoon contain details of changes to the consultation concept drawings that were advertised at the time through that consultation proposed changes to those concept designs that we variously work to weigh out since those submissions to try and resolve and achieve some alignment with submitters over those schemes and I will briefly summarize in a moment what those were for Hospital corner and Durham Street changes and then a large part of the report before you this afternoon are the traffic resolutions that come with these three schemes in terms of being legally enforceable in terms of yep traffic matters so I 'm very very briefly the hospital corner the main issues raised by submitters were around the proposal for some shared space cycle and pedestrian facilities around there there were concerns raised jointly by spokes the cycling advocacy group the blind foundation and the earthquake disability leadership group who were encouraging us to consider extra separation between cyclists and pedestrians there but big in view of the complex nature of the intersections and links around there and the very heavy level overuse of those facilities around there so one of the major proposals the major changes there is to introduce extra separation on those facilities for cyclists and pedestrians around the hospital corner area further submissions were received from the pantry District Health Board over ensuring that the proposals Paul Hospital corner did genuinely Doug cow with the proposals for the hospital redevelopment health precinct in that area of the Metro sports facility and so in the reports before the report before council this afternoon we 're proposing ongoing closely azon with both CDHP and indeed the Ministry of health making sure that all of these proposals due to have tell together they have major proposals for the degree development at the hospital but also of the replacement of the parking building there the blue building as it 's known and also a new outpatients facility in that area so they are very interested in making sure all of that works together okay can I just take other any questions I 'm going to take these in by project are there any questions at all on the hospital corner yeah yeah thank you madam Jeff um yes I mean that the proposals around schemes that are constantly revisited is our knowledge of proposed car parking buildings for instance and quantum 's of parking various sites worth continually revisiting the modeling most of the traffic modelling we 've undertaken for these schemes is looking at p.m. and am peak periods at 20 31 but and that 's a similar basis for all of these developments in the central city as far as the safety issues are concerned the first stage schemes which council implemented jointly with Sarah and the agency around the turn of the year which is where we shifted traffic from Oxford terrace for instance on two children street made it one way one waits an acid street there was a post construction safety audit carried out on that a number of changes have been made to the detail of some of those schemes since that time and what is before council this afternoon a final proposals for that location so if there are any outstanding safety issues that we need to deal with now in lieu of the final schemes they will be undertaken and delivered and indeed some already have a better addressed to the final proposals before council today then they will be dealt with through the scheme that is before council this afternoon so the term that goes from saying SF to hagley air where larger vehicles are currently struggling to get around without going into other traffic lanes is has been considered yes okay and you 're confident there 's adequate work yet all right um the other question I had was in terms of the cycleway obviously understanding on the so necessary cycleway why we 've put that on straight rather than on the metro sports area which we go up the governor I 'm between council and government because it just seems like we 're taking away a huge amount of car parking and also putting cyclists going through which will be fairly busy busy road when we could have put it more on to the private plane that we own okay with it so the accessible City proposals work within the the road boundary and so there 's been closely azon with the development of the Metro sports facility team throughout um we we of footpath and cyclocross that northern entrance to Metro sports there the proposals before you this afternoon contains some generous tree planting which is what the community asked for through share an idea back in 2011 all of these schemes contain a lot of tree planting within them the nature of the wide facility there we believe is the right solution that northern access to Metro sports there and it will link it with the new Hagley Park facility so it will blend with the plaza and whatever the development is at the northern side of Metro sports it will blend with that and and so we believe it 's a good balance between streetscape enhancements the needs of pedestrians and cyclists and the the needs of traffic in that area it 's just one quick one Vicki from it thinks just the dpa blind foundation with the impression once you 've made those changes they were happy with them or if they see those changes since you we offered further meetings with them and those involves the design consortium they 've delivered the giant design of these schemes for foundation the disability leadership group and spokes over the fine-grained detailing of these works or they 're implemented to make sure they 're absolutely satisfied that we 've got all of these locations the detail right because the Devils in the detail for for those people with these particular schemes thank you I 'm just increased with regards to the the lane going tuning on two down from chew em going north so it 's going after me like every other road that was changed as its glee but one lane going north on the left-hand side so what 's the safety risk with regards to debt while there is a transition period I mean so the proposal there is that becomes two way I guess the most important thing about that is is that section of chew on the street is being widened in partnership with the development of the justice and emergency services precinct so they 're pulling back about seven meters on that frontage if you look at the building there it 's actually set back quite substantially from that car yard that was previously there so pedestrian Plaza there that enables us to achieve some servicing base for justice down there and gives us the extra width to get that northbound lane in now some people have questioned why are we looking at the northbound laying there what what 's the point of that the point of that is is because of some of these street changes we made we need to deliver anyone coming in from the West the coming along chillun street we need to be able to give them access into the new car parking for the retail precinct at access that is off of litchfield street that 's one of the purposes of it but the other issue is because we 've taken the traffic heading into town off the river and they 're coming in a long chua we have to give them the ability to duck back along Oxford Terrace to achieve access to premises along there so that includes some Michael 's Church and the school there who are delighted with these proposals because it gives them bus access straight off the river and so on so it was lot of people have described as a contraflow it 's a two-way section street there it 's been fully safety audited as the detailed designs are delivered it will be continually audited because of the whole lineman of Durham street there we are completely confident that there will be no problems at southbound drivers arently finding themselves in the wrong lane there so so that 's the concern though the patterned surface so if you 're traveling south on Durham on the right-hand lane with the patterned surface that will be enough to ensure that the drivers don 't cut that corner so they come on to the because it as we all know we creatures of habit so there 's a type of a period of transition to retraining ourselves and the second question with regards to that as the parking taken out custom Michaels school is there and I am concerned with regards to children on the footpath etc the thoughts on there I 'll deal with the delineation issue first you were confident that the details of the scheme will make it absolutely clear where the delineation and that will not just be the delineation there but it will start up at the bridge basically so you 'll be guided into the logical lane to be in if you 're traveling south given that it 's going to change anyway will be wider it will look different as far as the school 's concerned in a way they 're getting something better at the moment they 're actually parking on quite a busy street some servicing is off to M Street some is they 're off Durham and so they 're they 're getting the improvement of most of that servicing actually being round on what it will be a very quiet oxford terrace lair where we 've maintained some parking there with sarah the number of parking sir i didn 't see the number of parking isn 't being removed from darren to being edited on tax for terrace credits the the details before council this afternoon are not the details of the odd-even river precinct proposals but to be relative it we we would it 's not only being achieved there in terms of servicing the parking plan which council approved last year is we 're looking at the cumulative effect of the removal of parking from street spaces with off street parking facilities and so we are looking for good short stay I up to four hours parking broadly being available within about a five-minute walk of most central city destinations there you are going to have some point hopefully reasonably soon a replacement Litchfield street parking building that was all very well service that area can put one more question and some Michael 's Church which is a functioning church so else weddings funerals and services etc so there 's been fully informed with regards to what 's hit me or knots for tears it could be more important for the purpose I realize it 's not quite on here but it does this scheme and Sierra 's design team for the Oxford terrace proposals as part of the agreement appreciate and sounds yes thank you very much temperatures Pauline did you know question their main the answer but when you talk about the detailed design you even got down to the very the Environment Committee it mean or what be done remember important you I think as as the Environment Committee have heard previously from karina jerk on behalf of the blind foundation and so on that they really like to see the really fine grain detail of some of these intersections that were getting things like tactile paving layouts wrecked and so on that they 're really ready able to give us really detailed advice most of it is best on site to be honest where we actually go out there with them and and there is an absolute commitment from series design team to do that and that designers at syrah have also been consulting them closely for instance over the Avery with precinct proposals as well so um effectively that the level the level of detail that I guess were coming to committee and cancel with it is in the reports this afternoon in what we then do from here is that the schemes are designed to actually enable this to happen in terms of the real deep technicalities of actually getting all of this right in terms of 're very happy to brief any members further on some of these details and further discussions where I think that would be good Cecily if you could you can think about an amendment if you want to okay yeah I don 't think I need one I think if if we 've got accessibility to it should we go into the committee thank you fine Danny you can I just check how many trees notable trees or particular trees or treason total will be removed as colorless process I don 't have the members in front of me I apologize i think they are listed in the report and the any existing trees that are being removed are shown on the steam plant council papers this afternoon so if you see an existing tree there with a red cross that is a tree that is there at the mind that is being removed the tree symbols with a green circle around them a new trees and the the proposals for cambridge terrace um and durham story which we 're talking about at the moment um one of the main objectives those beautiful mature trees as we possibly can Along Came but I think to affected of less notable examples there but that scheme in all three contained proposals for substantially increased kinds of trees just move back with the justice and emergency patient doesn 't I mean that building is pretty overwhelming and there 's not a lot of greenery dear and we 're moving the two trees that provide some sort of buffer to that just on the little street durham off the terrace corner my apology I don 't have the the numbers they are in the report I do believe though that I think the plaza outside the Justice emergency appreciate I think there is some tree planting proposed as part of that within the red line of the justice precinct in other words it 's being delivered by that rather than this scheme and especially on the corner of Durham and litchfield street at a North Western chrome you have to knit numbers Tim like additional they are in the report madam chair um sorry my head I quite sure wedges I was just concerned that I know the hospital corner is quite a number of trees that are getting removed and the other the other thing was I just I 'm still kind of struggling to understand where people going to park when they come into the city is it just we expect that they 'll go to the off street car parking building hmm so but just yeah it really i 'm just going to get a scale so how many car parks that we were moving here I do have those numbers so the hospital corner proposals are reducing the previous on-street parking numbers by 123 the durham street cambridge terrace proposals reduce the on-street parking numbers and are stressed numbers by 79 and the Manchester Street proposals reduce the numbers of on-street parks by 35 I think it 's important to stress at this point though that the proposals generally contain the the general proposal that remain on streets by spaces should be more efficiently used than they previously were so they are very much being prioritized for short stay parking on street loading and servicing to assist frontage premises and mobility schemes so looking at the ball numbers does not show the complete picture the complete picture is making better use of the street space as it exists in the hospital area there are likely to be proposals for a significant replacement of the blue parking building there the Durham Cambridge proposals will include the ability to obviously to get the Litchfield street car park and any parking associated with other developments down that corridor and the Durham Cambridge ones as I 've just said are really about maintaining great access to the new parking building off of Litchfield street right and just the final question I 'm really concerned about the two-way of durham street so here that would literal straight it didn 't it was pretty scary if we wanted to change that what would our options be here and 0 it 's a few at zero I 'm not just from a safe and like I see people turning wrong way up my way streets already there 's the natural kind of progression for people with an arrow and is to go straight so it just it just arm Street more further down or two he referred Street which would be probably provide good access and or what could we do make sure we don 't believe that 's necessary and we believe the proposals of just said in safety terms are very legible they will provide very clear arm destination signage and just some weeks ago when can 't cancel considered the first five years of the long-term plan council approved within that two and a half million dollars for wayfinding signage within the central city and so it really is about giving drivers coming into town and all road users very clear information about where they 're going to park and what the best route is to get to those premises as far as that section of two-way durham street is concerned in fact that was gazetted under an accessible city by the minister in december of last year so that is a record changer yes it 's around the loss of on-street parking and obviously a lot of this is around the gelt philosophy this removing water street parking and probably my concern is is much couple parking they won 't get on the public transport so I 'm just wondering is this the drive of the City Council to issue remove all three pack into push people more into public transport through the successful City point no I think the the proposal we 're only proposing the removal of parking within these schemes where there is a very use of that street scape so to deliver the level of tree planting the community asked for through share an idea as you have seen on chew and street with the tree pits that are going in there it takes a lot of space and to deliver separated cycle facilities wider footpath in the heart of the central city in most streets because most of the streets are 20 metres wide you don 't actually have many options if you 're going to introduce separated I don 't understand it so it 's a balance and this small amount of the accessible transport we 're losing 237 car backs so that 's a size of the old that same size the old crossing car back they are probably them the most significant proposals in terms of the effects on on-street parking we acknowledge that we recognize that but they are being taken account of in the analysis through the parking plan of the needs for off-street parking as well and we believe the proposals here are a balanced approach to actually they 're not anti car they 're antique congestion because if we don 't actually act to accommodate the extra treat make you fully appreciate it what I can 't put up counted another way we 're proposing this for the sea city prevalence nice wonderful less congested space will we apply that same rule that is the suburban key activity centers where is dominating car parks are available on the street and maybe even proposed to each the meter those car parks in the suburban spaces because of the loss of the we having here which has an effect on our budget I can 't answer that soft however that philosophy is this very similar in terms of the records and Road redesign I mean you 've got a narrow piece of road and my rocky cycles so that 's how to change this right all across the city _"

carried item three of strategy and finance performance report for the 12 months corporate finance report we actually have a problem in that one of it most of our corporate guy needs to be boarded yeah so a camp yeah so Peter and died no Peterson Auckland no Peter Ryan barbie duran okay so good luck Yanni item to corporate financial just um you know obviously percent of movement and interest rates in the last month so and just wondered whether we could get some information as to what impact of any that 's having on a need for poorer in the cost of our own yep so your Ford and first-rate contracts so Peter sonders rights so we 'll get a report to the stratagene from it any yeah it 'd be useful but I women I guess it raises a question do we have the right strategy in place of policies and fires given what about head straight in finance because it 's very difficult on sure sure yeah he 's you just a couple of questions what about the debt paid was 301 there a permanent and a 2.1 permanent improvement councils dispositions that was just how that bearing out in terms of the it 's a revenue ratio we you know obviously we were told we would be having quarterly reports over there so are you over to give us an update oh but with it 's sitting at the moment are you on the next cause Lin are you on the performance report yeah okay just wait wait one we take more get through this one first okay nothing else on this item to page 300 yeah okay no I think it was moved in secret it wasn 't no wasn 't ref and Paul we 're doing this yeah i 'll put that those in favor please say aye those first carried and then item three the performance report for the 12 months glen you can ask that now obviously just it the impact it is having on our ratio which has been the key underpinning the whole financial challenge that we 've people will hear in is better than what we were from memory it is better than what we were forecast okay because i obviously you know like all of us quite came to track this and i have asked previously how often can we have that information and was told quarterly because these are quarterly reports so so we are going to get all the next strategy in on it that would be great but does that mean we 'll only know the ratios on an annual basis well you can 't that matter and we do calculate their the ratios and more regular met okay it 's just then I do believe effect they 're probably what do you get it handed okay just in case sorry one more question 2 on page 30 for and the 5.3 the trends waste dividend how many more dividends we may expect comprends waste given that the BRP inter will continue to archive is that as well well we 'll continue to operate beyond the wisdom to saturated life I know there 's been a fire but it will still be operated probably created some more whether they will be further in terms of um we 'll have to get me there 's been a final dividend announced that 's coming post ramon in 3.3 3.3 million that 's came in since 30 jun cuz these are still your 30 jun numbers i don 't what and what was budgeted what was budgeted perhaps I could because it but now you too I 'm approximately two point three million okay it 's more than number of dividends not so much the amount but how many more do you speak and trans wastes SOI 426 15 16 there is a reduction and the dividends that they forecasting oh and that statement of intent comes through a different committee than the rest of this one it 's more in future years how many more you know how many extra that 's they 've gone out three years in there I 've gone at one year and they 're stepping the routine yeah like I said we 're does that state statement of intent came through I can 't_''_592.71 I know it doesn 't come to be strategy and 't come through cch hermana yeah okay right any other things in relation to this yanny just I think it 's been about three months we 've asked for a report on the district plan costs we 've just heard that there 's unbudgeted 8.8 million and I know that the order in council made us incurred one hundred percent of the cost so we should be really grateful for Sarah 's you know contribution but but I guess enough number us well I 'm concerned that we don 't even have any budget controls over the cost of this hearing process and it may be things that we wish some of that budget to go towards in terms of expert evidence through the hearings that we need to think about so this I think previously we 'd asked for a report on the cost controls over it because this is a huge impact on rates and this is about the second year in a row where the budgets blowing out so when can we start can I suggest it Jonnie I think it 's I suggest that we actually possible for a report on the budget and the costs of the district plan review but also the means by which those those finances are prioritized because I think ya knees point is that there 's a feeling of lack of control over how those things are prioritized yeah said okay but it 's pretty buckets don 't say we important for the conversation going forward which so leaving that in your capable hands it may not make me make next week 's maybe they say they 're following after that 's okay yeah preferably next week 's but if not because I think most of it will be a discussion around a range of issues preferably next week 's just a few paragraphs would be helpful to start but essentially we need to start making but what I 'd like is for us to easily get a budget actually start making decisions about how that money is allocated and understand what cost controls replaced understand where it 's coming from three words that 's why I 'm asking for if possible next week even though it might be a so a number is they 're getting pressure from people who have got writing projects skirt or not skirt but capital costs in terms of fixing and I just wonder whether there 's any sort of discussion area budget given that we 're carrying forward a lot where there 's any discretionary budget we have to respond to those cases where Paul and I got one last night people were told it would have been works not happening because the budget constraints but they 've got flooding up to here and in the building and we 've got projects that we 've got our budget that are happening that we 're carrying forward so if we could reallocate or substitute and actually get that immediate work done then it would be really good so just an ad today how do we do does that go through the community board or as by way of requests orders that come to infrastructure committee or I think it should if you put your specific requests through to the chief executive and then I think it would probably go to me yeah I 've staff probably it 's being a lot of Correspondence cuz i only got it today it 's okay yeah that 's with it or not no no but just in terms of the process if Dave can fix it at his level then who will otherwise it comes to infrastructure but we have another stream of work that came out of the LTP in terms of the prioritization of other capital projects that people had requested so maybe that we just if you look at six point yeah if you look at 6.2 you 've got 18 million dollar under steam you 're saving money on roads and footpaths and you 've got roads and footpaths that are broken that we want to spend money on to fix so there needs to be a process through this report or through some mechanism where we can actually say because it needs yeah it 's not that there 's not the neck it 's a very scenic needs to Alan and one place much as Daniel plan waiting another year when they 've got flooding going through is not a beast sorry something like their issue of whether there can be any substitution within those amounts if they wouldn 't strategy and finance be a sensible place for that don 't know not next week but there 's two questions and what yannis asking one is about a specific one but one is the general issue of if we want footpaths for example made a priority and we aren 't doing some some aspect what other ones can we bring forward faster is is the question I understand that but what yarn is wanting is a process yeah so if you guys could hit work out a process and bring it back its to somewhere that you think is appropriate I know there 's been questions around next week strategy and Finance Committee 's there 's been some questions ask around how do we prioritize and put plants in particular and we 're putting together some information for that because I bring it up there we 'll start the discussion there okay okay and then put this that report as a whole is at moved and seconded no it 's moved by please say aye I was hurried and they 're mixed one is earthquake claims _"

    "text": "Oh purely pro forma cuz you know I 've got some things that I want to rise and at least to have a Democrat discussion about it well why we have the debate and see where we get to them from there if you prefer well I sweated it I actually when I got the sagene Durham and I 've seen what was coming up I 'm actually really surprised that there hasn 't been a type of this i saw this here and i thought our thank goodness we 're getting out of the Dark Ages this is a no-brainer you know it 's it is a safer option to not try all these sort of things will pilot them you know i will tell you what 's what safe is our human race is to not progress with online surgery with robotics you know it 's not progressed with consuming media through netflix and high-speed fiber lee it 's not it 's not explore a driverless car it 's not embrace electric vehicles it 's not advanced computerized avionics we haven 't checked our mailbox at home for meeting I looked at my letterbox and it 's still in d not one thing in it because I don 't receiving a thing in the mail I don 't want to receive anything in the mail but then yeah well no because I was actually candidate in the election so I might get one piece of mail every three years the last time i posted anything in a snail mail physical box it was actually at the last local body elections 2013 and given that i was running in the election I still lift it to the last couple of days to post it because it was such a pain and inconvenience to participate in local democracy in a way that couldn 't be more of a polar opposite to how I run my day-to-day life you know uh I 'm not convinced that I would have ever returned my census form without badgering from officials because it 's illegal not to if I hadn 't been able to do it online you know I was appointed to a commercial board and private enterprise land in 2010 prior to there for over five years longer than I 've been a counselor and the biggest difference that I notice and it never ceases just to give me a real wake-up call from coming from commercial land to council land is how councils are so risk-averse how we don 't embrace new technologies you know it was actually this year 2015 that we were able to have an app to read our agendas like really unbelievable you know and at a company if you don 't innovate and think outside of the square day after day of today you become irrelevant you if you stand still you go bankrupt you can 't just raise rates you can 't just say well this is the safer option it 's game over so yes other security concerns sure you 'd be really silly not to investigate that of course we need to explore that but I think it 's the wrong question to say do we do we or do we not embrace the way the world 's moving i think we so of course we embrace the way the world 's moving we want to ensure that the concerns we have are appropriately addressed and that you get it right you know if you you talk about any systems they 've got their flaws I 'll tell you what 's harder and what 's easier it 's a lot easier to go along to someone 's mailbox and pinch out a form that 's been sitting there for a month because they don 't cheat their box take it and chuck it in the post you don 't need to be a computer expert to be able to do that you don 't need to have a degree in quantum physics to be able to do that every system is going to have its drawbacks but you know are you baking the coal company and its business plan in the eighteen hundreds or do you do you pick the apples or the googles you know I know which one I want to beg I wanted to bring innovation Simon to a city and I thought that we did too if we 're rebuilding the newer city in the world you know and someone realizes that yeah I can hear that wailing they 've realized they need to post something I want to be the account so that anything 's possible so don 't eat Masterson or cell when or meta meta be innovative than us I don 't strive to be in the dark ages you know I think you can embrace to run a local government election like it was nineteen sixteen or you can understand that the world 's changed embrace that people won 't participate in local government in a different way like it 's actually 2016 so you can push for our legacy to be safely soon as the tide if you must but my view is that you jump aboard you arrive ride that wave and you 'll be at the forefront of innovation cutting edges our city and actually be with the world is going so I am absolutely staggered there 's no support from and this is everything i hate about local government we 're actually having this conversation it is a disgrace for us to not embrace that and I think this is a Christchurch and you can in confirming everything about how dark ages local government is because it 's just not where the world 's at so wake up and get with the times your disgrace if you don 't look at this yeah I won 't take very long um I would have thought I would have supported online voting I 'm a big fan of online engagement online participation tools like lumio Citizen lab and there 's plenty more out there but I think the reality is voting is a very very different thing is a very unique thing and I think in terms of participation there are other ways of improving participation so I don 't really have an issue with that I think the security issue is a big one and the fact that the tech community has come forward and said they don 't support this for me that 's a big no-no and Christchurch is a center of Technology and so I would have expected that community to be supportive if they 're not then it 's back to the drawing board I think also we when I look at the calendar for the next eight months it 's crazy and I just think do we need to be doing this right now 2019 happy to look at it again happy for other councils to have a look at it but it doesn 't suggest to me on the evidence that 's being presented to us that this is something that we really need to be exploring now there 's more work to do on the technology side there are huge issues around login passwords I mean sending out passwords in the mail I mean I can just see what a nightmare that could be we 've seen recently actually a changeover between bnz and Westpac around the air points credit cards they have had huge issues just dealing with the administration around that so I think you know agree with Jamie we should be embracing online stuff as much as possible but I don 't think the evidence that we have today supports us as a council spending money on this right now okay right we can incorporate them I was quite keen on this have been quite progressive as a council we do have live streaming we have our other online resources i have some huge questions over this particular dimension of online participation which actually is about the heart of our democracy I 'm still not satisfied I 've had a straight answer over the Auckland situation I think there 's more that sits behind that I 'm not prepared to put our reputation as a city at stake and I say this on the back of and out of the context of loss of accreditation we are clawing back our mana as a council and as a city and I think the risks here are two great I believe we can 't guarantee mitigation of risk and the potential risks here are far-reaching which case scenario means invasion of our electorate lives and I think you think the natural hazards chip is kicking up a big time if it happened I think we 'd be in big trouble I haven 't heard how there would be security scrutineering of votes we will know about the denial of service risk I p value voting at risk and I don 't think you can actually say that not proceeding with this is not progressive I think that 's a false dichotomy it 's in local government we have a responsibility to make good decisions and it 's out of that which I think it 's quite telling it wasn 't a seconder for the staff recommendation that in itself as a statement Thank you Thank You Glenn appling it 's an interesting debate and I concur and endorse what refs it actually because it 's basically what we 're always coming from as well you know you look at the G elections and we still toggle off down to a cardboard polling booth um now Jamie Goff talked about the dark ages but the advantages of that is that it 's a community experience we 're actually moving as a community and there 's a little bit of excitement generated from there and I am I consumers that we casual eyes voting a little bit too much so in that regard I mean you could say that the general election is incredibly dark age just concerned that we do we characterize that end in don 't don 't actually encourage participation because of that um we talk about mailbox well birthday card so I 'd much rather have a real boost a card in my mailbox in an ecard any day so you know it 's not all dark ages stuff trailing smoke my view and I just think the risks of the year the the fact that it 's not supported by the tech community is really seen as a big concern and I agree with the timing perhaps it could be looked at in the future but just not yet for Christchurch I wonder about Christchurch being a relevant place to trial this anyway because of our circumstances are so changed what results are we going to glean from from it because we r we still up in the air our boundaries are going to change incredibly next year anyway so I 'm wondering how we could apply the data from the other two in any way so I 'd support post voting this thank you i think I 'm rest probably cure that with regards to our position referee we can look at commercial end and council and we are stretched for cash our communities we talked about this wonderful word resilience that are being stretched as well and we 're asking even more of our staff so if this were truly commercially and I personally would be sitting back waiting for someone else to go for it look at what they do what the pitfalls are and then be prepared the following election to go on and take out the apples rather than having to be and we 've talked about their pilots trials I do not want the residents of the city and our staff to have to be the guinea pigs I know these things have been all over the world but I would prefer to watch someone else do it and then come out and do it when we have some stable ground to move forward on so you know we talked we heard a bit professional risk we have ripped reputational risk and I don 't think that the resilience of our city and our staff far prefer to play safe for the selection I know it 's dull and boring but it is secure and look at the benefits for the following election thank you thanks Tim Andrey yeah I agree with Jamie that posting a letter and just seemed a little bit quaint and that we do want to do everything we can to get out of the dark ages as he put it but we only need to do that in a way that we 're totally confident in and I don 't have a level of confidence in this the meats of threshold uncomfortable with unfortunately I 'm also with ref I when I first read the report I expected that I would be supporting this it 's exactly the sort of thing that I naturally would want to support but when we hear from technical experts about doubts that they 've got you know that 's something that understandably sets some alarm bells ringing public confidence in Council processes is one of the things we spend a lot of time talking about and public confidence in the process that get councillors and you know we 've heard from a number of people today different sources around you know issues of security of democracy of privacy election electoral integrity concerns around the effects of technological advances vulnerability hacking all of that sort of stuff we 've heard about errors process errors human errors system errors all things that don 't sit well for me in a sentence about something as important as an election so as I say there 's a level of confidence that I just don 't have in this that I would have would have hoped to have had and I also agree that the time isn 't right we 've got plenty of other fish to fry than this one at the moment i 'm sure and i 'm confident the time will be right and i 'm sure there will be a time that I do feel comfortable supporting a trial of online voting or something more than that but for me that not now for a number of reasons thank you Andrew fell look I 'm I want to thank gum skip a trip but also and the professional advice you 've given us and like I have to say though that basically our elections depend on the principle of the secret ballot and the information we 've got in terms of sort of being able to mitigate the damage that will be really limited and in effect it basically may not be available at all so it 's very premature to in my view to even try to do what 's called a trial with this project of the stage like for example if we were buying a new car even as an electric car you would want a test drive we wouldn 't get our council wouldn 't get that opportunity even give it even if they even given that what we 're hearing about doesn 't have a good safety record there 's certainly also no real evidence at all that in fact that this will increase the elect the voting turnout and you know basically the local government act requires us to vote according to what we hear in terms of evidence and I think it 's it it 's important it fact we keep your integrity and we look at the evidence that is actually in front of us so I 'm going to support the amendment that we have made today by gluten thing Thank You Jimmy in principle I support a kind of a new trier traded a new new new way or try to new the kind of methodology to the newly and technology say to a butter-pie devoting is quite a series because based on the both side under the the kinda of the information I 'm still tout in East estate you know probably the consulate unter even the problem my fellow councillor still know the country personal confidence if the result of working be received by everyone I thought because so one is a uncertainty the other end because due to the technology still have a hake still have feces still have a Somali the you know this kind of the reverse effect so it 's a still a bigger risk etc another one is a I still think you know even you are aware the election result in overseas they will make a kind aflam I know just one or two words ever enemies mistake I say to them I thought is some ways intentional to make the mistake sh 0 so this hi series so in this state to me is difficult to supporter you know the online the voting system so I support this amendment thank you the last summer I really safe is it Yanni and then Paul was it have I missed anyone Dave um thank you um look I um in 2013 and December this council actually made a submission to say that we did support online voting but I think it 's fair to say that are some quite significant security risks have happened around the globe in terms of the Internet in that time and also I think the thing for me is personally I would love to see online voting but the issue for me is that if people don 't have confidence of it and people if we introduce this on a climate of fear then I think it will be doomed to fail so I think we do need to make take some more number of the comments that have been made through this debate I think show a little bit of a lack of understanding around some of the current systems for example people now can tell who is voted in the last and the previous elections that 's there 's this information that is actually about people 's voting behaviour that we can glean from the existing relation that exists so you know the idea that there is concern about how the information gets used I think as legitimate but it needs to be kept in the context of the points that were made there actually no system is safe or secure and you can never one hundred percent guarantee that that will be the case but what you can do is look at how you mitigate some of those effects so for me you know while personally I would have supported going to online voting I 've heard the concerns that have been expressed by around this council table and by the people that have made deputations and it did raise an interesting point for me which is this should be the different sectors whether it 's the tech sector or whether it 's the community sector and with our citizens about how we could utilize it if we were going to do so and unfortunately because of the time constraints I don 't believe we can do that with on this current process so so I won 't yeah I 'm happy to support the amendment but I just also want to say um we can be progressive when it comes to voter turnout and voter participation and you know although the method of voting is only one part of that jigsaw you 've got things like enrollment you 've got what happens during the voting time you 've got Canada information booklets and online tools so there 's a whole bunch of other ways we can use I hope technology and innovative and progressive methods to encourage voter participation and voter turn up and so there were a number of things we raised through the Select Committee submission around extending the deadline on the day of voting around having a national campaign coordinated centrally around thinking more of how to be cast because I agree with Jamie anyone that 's gone in to do a special vote during an election time and postal ballot it is an epic dog 's breakfast of a process and puts people off and so anything we can do to make it simpler for people to participate we should be looking at and there will be ways other than online voting where we can address them I issue so I hope that your when we get more information back will support some of those other things that I think we can we can do so you know I 'm disappointed that we can 't sign off on this today but I understand the concerns that have been expressed things have changed since two thousand thirteen when we put the original submission than and I think it is important that the public have confidence in our voting systems and I just want to end with you know I think in Christchurch anyway we certainly have had a fairly good track record with the current voting system and the current provider and so you know that so we do need to I think to spend more time working through those concerns before we before we make make make the step yes has been suggested so it 's been a good debate I think this is healthy to have these different points of view and I think it 's good that we are talking about it today but really as I think today 's shown to do this within an hour or within three days there 's not the appropriate way to bring it and if we wanted to go to them to look in my personal capacity I love online of stuff I buy my groceries online I bought my last car online from Auckland so I don 't think that 's the issue from a private capacity but we are dealing with public money and we are dealing with a quite a different situation to the private sector and that 's all around risk and risk appetite you know the private sector do risk more than that then the public sector we know that the the private sector can deliver buildings cheaper than we can so we have to be cognizant of that as well so you know as I so I be supportive of this here but I think when we 're dealing with with public money and and public outcome I think we have to take that into consideration and I just don 't think we 've had enough time to do that here at the moment is yani pointed out two or three days to bring this on board thing and he 's a bit more thought but as I say you know my personal private capacity I likes up online and I think you know we need to progress but I thinking that right at this point in time we 've come through an earthquake we 're only four years out we 've got a lot on our plate and you know every cent everything we put Andre community at the moment seems to be a stressor and we 've put a lot of stress of them over this last term and I think right now is just the wrong time to go in here okay thank you days thank you hacking and banking and even the most high-tech international security systems a heck so I really just don 't feel comfortable with launching into an online voting system where the trial potentially does lend itself to the tampered with and it 's a trial but as we pointed out today that trial has binding results and until such time as I can have some confidence in the IT around this system and safeguards against fraudulent use of it I would be happy to support with the direction we 're going at the moment until we can get that safety thank you so can I know put it put it oh that 's a speak that 's going to be carried I 'll put that which was there before you it applies to take Bethany online trial for the 2016 local elections i 'll put that those in favor please say aye those opposed no you want that recorded yes please my here then reporters yep we can electronically record oh yeah you will record it by pigeons right okay adda clear that carried thank you that 's that report thank you guys um _"

the city 's artificial financially so the last thing we want the council of elders because to go to an agreement the setting to come up another 30 scene or whatever so I want to pickle sports clothes I king if big rig right and the worst-case scenario insurance Hudson can I just go to one step further further questions that you 're asking cancel the tournament 40,000 dolls that long table reminders predicated on the group 10 Gyptian relatively big cornerstones if there are going to be 45 lat authorities take part in the trial then there 's something we have to distribute hands just those ones sorry and distributed amongst just those distant career and so the temptation is always just father three questions are people free as I can you talk to initially a so-called honour ability you have word salvation which you can refer to a lot of editing you go tell us a little bit more about that vulnerability how to exploit even more results a provisional opportunity open when the new so what are the Commission put this here that they they could also wanted to monitor people 's heavily I 'd like to the site you may not be familiar or pressure but is a thing called google analytics which tells you how people gives your website they use they knew their these are then called pet works from brother company developed service so in some of the electric Commission site had also sent a query off to the pit website it was the network 's site that had a listen our honorable someone could have gotten of guinea they would mess around with some cameras and all that so it 's a very efficient extra rest all right thank you second question is simple with anyone alamosa galilee mission the insurance insurance would increase if we went with online voting through the trial compared to the premium that we pay at the moment would it be fair to say that that means that the insurer would see a greater perceived risk in online voting than paper voting we only had discussions with the our brokers last friday and that 's on the basis of negotiating insurance for the 2016 elections on a national basis we have effectively one policy that covers every local authority and the indications that we 've had from the insurers who the brokers are currently dealing with is that the brokers very keen to continue with the arrangement with ensuring local authority elections and that the premium for including an online option is actually a effectively a nominal sum so no I don 't believe I think they have accepted that the risks that by covering than the risks that they cover any way to have to rerun any election so that doesn 't cover a recount that 's that 's something else that we 're currently negotiating for insurance for okay that 's fine and then I just wanted to pick up on Tim 's line of questioning and thinking of the contractual relationship between the council and elections com obviously elections calm have done this work for the council which is work that council pay elections calm to do is that arrangement already in place for 2016 our elections calm already contracted for the 2016 election regardless of the outcome of this debate correct career in fact they 've been advised that that the contract that we currently have covers it covers an extended period because that we need to have that that certainty in place we will be going to the market following the 2016 elections for future elections all right now we 've also talked and again in answered Tim 's question we talked about the hundred and fifty thousand been the cost of the additional mail out 240,000 overall been the leaves obviously a ninety thousand dollar difference there i 'm assuming that that would be additional charges from elections com to the council and i 'm interested in like as we move forward and make savings by not using the postal option to such a great degree does that mean as the amount we 're spending on postage decreases the amount that we 're spending on services from elections com or another provider would increase i 'm just interested in what what the incentives for the various outcomes might be i guess if I 'm been honest about it like well i can comment that some of the external costs that we have for postage and mail outs will vary and they there again we have a national contract with a postal services provider and they those bills come through elections combi they are officially part of our costs but you might like to comment on on your charges yeah sure and especially when it comes down to this configuring a the infrastructure required for the for the first time of online voting call it a pilot will call it infrastructure we 're throwing at this is very big and it comes with a price that will consist of two data centers tier 3 which is the best you can get in new zealand one will be in auckland want to be in christchurch they 'll have built-in redundancy within both of those we have built-in redundancy isp pipes going into them so we 're throwing an awful lot at this and that comes with a price we don 't know if that 's way too much we won 't know until the trial is completed but we think it 's better to a very big sledgehammer for the first time through so the cost that the positioning of the costs will become more fine granular as we know what to expect one of the things we don 't know for instance and this is why I think calling it a trial is not that inappropriate one of the things we don 't know is we the voting patterns when it goes online we know the voting patterns very well for postal voting and the unit of measure for postal get out peaks and troughs and there 's always a peek at the end we don 't know what that 's going to look like online and the the measure of unit will be down to the second so we 're throwing an awful lot of resource at this to cope with what we think will be a reasonable amount to cope with at any one time of course at any one time throughout the whole three-week voting period so we 're building something that which is staying at the peak for three weeks so there are costs but just because it 's the start really until we gain some more information and know how those voting patterns are going to eventually look like we 're not sure but having said that we can actually wrap up further with it with our providers so if we find that things are a grinding slow we can throw more resources at at it as well I 'm going to run a scenario and and I looks like you to comment on it we know that systems can get compromised we know that good so there 's lots of information of who we are actually out there online the we know there 's a very low voter turnout so this last election we had 42 cents in it so there 's fifty eight percent don 't vote and that 's probably always going to be the case with and makes me change something radically so there 's always gonna be a large portion of the population that will not bite so the pen system that you haven 't place is susceptible to at this point as we know you don 't know how much is going on line 58 sent it could be compromised and you 'll never know because sending the pen sailing comedians at once those people are going to vote anyway so you sort of see where my scenarios going the fifty-eight percent at risk of compromise now also online sorry also we know that the information around who votes and who doesn 't vote that will be known it 'll be somewhere someone had that statistical data of what you know genre what type of person does not vote as well so if a hacker got into the system found that information out they could with some certainty actually place a vote with an individual pin number knowing those people aren 't if you were going to vote and they 'll need to get found out so just like you to comment on that sure but part of part of the mitigation against those various scenarios as we won 't do what Washington DC did for instance and leave a PDF of all depends on the password sitting on the server which was not a very good idea we can 't and we also don 't allow votes to be changed so you can 't come in and vote using a pen and come back and later on and vote again which is the Washington DC thing the the protection of the pins and passwords is is taking very seriously to the extent where I 'm no voting pack that goes out there 'll be one piece of that information the other piece that 's required to login is actually coming from another provider so we never give the other provider there 's only one but for 11 but to the other who will lodge it put in the post to go out to the public the the the pins and passwords when they 're in the database are encrypted the security measures that are in these tier 3 data by our data centers like it 's physical as well as technological barriers that to get into even if that gets breached then we monitor where where the votes are coming from at a technological level so we have IP address monitoring if we see a whole bunch of votes being cars from a particular location we start showing interest in that we 've also got the paper votes to compare against so if we start seeing a big sway away from the trend which is in the paper vote system and we 've got a great comparison right there and if we start seeing those sort of discrepancies in a red lights start flashing we start investigating what 's going on so there are various mitigations methods that we have already planned for that very scenario elaborate on this to try and increase voter turnout is one of the reasons but if we see a huge online voter increase that will be treated with suspicion efforts if it 's huge then like we 're not it it 's going to be interesting to see what it 's going to look like where we are of course hoping there a certain age group sins there they will pick up on it particularly the younger voter will pick up on earth who probably isn 't voting at the moment they 're not bothered with plotting and envelope in the post the if you see a huge if we started saying one hundred percent voted online i think we 'd start getting interested in that other people actually get we put number in the first places it emailed out with Justin it 's posted there 's no emails involved so you still secure those bugs confine it yeah yeah yeah yeah hamster develops further wrong yeah and I and look the evolution that I talked about before the model that 's being proposed is not unusual it 's just the first want to opt out at a postal site I just want electronic and it costs Skurka you have a comment on one of the submitters said security and anonymity are at odds do you have a comment around that statement so security an anonymous well we we do it I 'm not sure okay um i 'm just gonna be on E quick question it 's more a question of Darrell and just one of the things that this limit is touched on what I thought was a pretty good point that we needed a question was just around the public consultation given that this is quite a significant change to the way in which we do the elections and the fact that we 've had no public engagement or consultation without community as do their preferences I just wondered um yeah whether how we kind of applied that test because it did seem to me that given the interest you know the huge interest in a short period of time whether or not we should really be consulting with our community over the ax preferences in this regard given would always say we should take our community with us whenever we do anything and certainly the online voting working party when it came up with its report indicated that if say local authority wanted to to move to an online voting system they should be public consultation we 're not moving to an online voting system we 're actually moving to an option for online voting so the community will have their choice whether they continue to vote online whithersoever they continue to vote through the postal system or choose to try them the online voting system _"

    "text": "pretty much we have a few parties that we also have the extra item that was raised by Jo Daviess blood member on the 27 of the wall bust so I don 't know whether you want to deal with it one first excellent that 's great as you 'll be aware from Joe 's presentation on the on the twenty-seventh the the woolston can we be in close shoppers as do to close they haven 't had word on when that will be yet I 've been told that bigger than three months notice but there hasn 't been given yet the a indeed which the only other bank in the area is also moving out of Austin and this will leave no banking services in the area and so the board has written to both the chief executive at the New Zealand Post group into the minister for studying enterprises and in our next minutes which won 't be coming for another month but it 's too late will be requesting that the council do the same and so we would like to ask you to do that easy on post group in the Minister for state-owned enterprise and we can get you copies of a leashes and two to stop the closure of the the Kiwi bankin and walston I think it 's really important the other sad news we heard of course was New Zealand Post taking away the jobs from the call center contact center and I don 't know what CDC are doing in that regard but if you take Walston for example and you look at ironically look at katie banks sustainable sustainability and corporate responsibility policy and what they say is a staunchly Kiwibank doing what 's right for New Zealand is part of our makeup and that means running a business in a sustainable way environmentally socially and just plain nicely to us that means we support our communities we look after our people our country and our environment and what 's really interesting about the woolston issue is that we 're taking away the proposal sorry that that doing is to take away a facility where people can walk to to put it into fury mode which is an area basically card dominated development and so it 's totally against their core sustainability and corporate responsibility policies and I think it 's really important we 've seen a number of Kiwi banks being lost in our ward and I don 't know if this other Ward 's in the city as well previously with Stan will road for example so i think council should play a role in this and i think we do need to start thinking about how we deal with industry or with businesses around investing in our areas particularly places like wolfs terminal stem wall road or new brighton because what we 're seeing is a retreat and i think it 's really unfortunate given the huge amount of time and money we 're investing and trying to improve these neighborhoods post-earthquake so strongly urge you to support it i think we need to be doing a lot more proactive work around our relationships of these government SOS because there 's huge opportunity and at the moment we 're paying a huge price thank you I also totally support this a post office isn 't just 'll go and pay bills it 's a place where people go and bump into each other it 's the in many communities the heart of the community and traditionally so if I compare it to Littleton where we recently lost our bien said bank and we 're a few years ago we lost our gas station you know this is about community 's ability to do things within the community and to be able to to be sustainable as a community without needing to necessarily go out of their village center or their local area so we as a council spend a huge amount on master plans and community development and other issues this is something that kind of goes right against all of the theories of doing that the post office the NZ post as a state-owned enterprise governments are also spending huge amounts of money in the city on various initiatives and you know we get the surveys back from Sarah on social well-being and all of that kind of thing here 's an opportunity to do something that promotes community development and social well-being just by absolutely right that we should be sending this letter I just wanted to pick up on the word no it was as I heard it from Sarah the chief executive of New Zealand Post and the Minister for state-owned enterprises he 's young post group yeah that 's Kiwi banks in there I think that the they have said that they were hoping to keep postal services in there in a dairy or in a bookshop or something a net building but I don 't see that that 's likely look here I 'm going to agree with both Yanni and Angela 's here goes a little bigger that 's humming banks make a lot of money out of our investment a personal investment and they do have a responsibility because they are the people that actually provide the confidence for other smaller and visas with this nose as commercial areas as well so when they pull out those small commercial and visas are less likely to invest in that community and that is for me the key issue around this whole thing so I youjizz support actually writing to that they are dealing with a post-earthquake environment we need to see that investment back and those smaller communities to ensure that we actually get the rebuild that we want to see for the future just post the September earthquake go right to the the sea of Westpac around this very issue and it was an interesting response I head back after sir thank you very much we have two leases and an extra recommendation from the board so the first lease is for the cannery Rugby Football Union incorporated the changing rooms at South Hadley park and the board recommendation is that the council adopt the staff recommendation so the board were happy with what that later lease arrangement yep the sort of kids booster kindergartens McCormick 's Bay they just about ready to rebuild they were barely earthquake damaged and demolished and they have been operating out of a small church up on Mount Pleasant and it 'll be great to have them back on site ya no deal it nice yeah so we got an additional recommendation underneath the least one who did it needs so I lack of policy in some areas oh great that 's good then all done yeah it does indeed doesn 't and then page 155 there 's a achieve persons report and it 's on through me bridge approaches and section design that is about to open people are really looking forward to actually getting rid of the road cones having the lights operating and being able to use that intersection properly after many long years of disruption and the board would like to the council to approve those um which won 't come as any surprise but we did ask as a council I think we had a resolution around getting a report back on the fair maid bridge from start to finish just to learn any lessons from the the costs and the processes and I just really want to emphasize the see if we 've got whether we need to do that again or I mean it is a question okay do you want a resolution or okay just wanted to sorry um make it you know clear the pages road bridge is a lifeline bridge I 'm going to red zone as a red herring visa V gay host road bridge which is also good I 'll support this but sorry this one got started this one got started pre quake so that 's one got started pre quake thank you very much _"

    "text": "cool thank you all right we have we have two reports are one on page 55 and one on page 38 one which is in the supplementary so tuning to the first one we have a partay matter about the board recommends the council that request staff to investigate development of policy for protection promotion management of natural springs and crush at City and then there is a report later on and the agenda from council staff saying that it 's not necessary to have a policy but feedback that I 've had through to me about that is that it 's actually not adequate doesn 't it doesn 't address new and emergence strength Springs or an existing residential other areas and it would be good to actually formulate a policy on on exactly what the board is proposed and I request that the counselors support the board 's recommendation yeah I don 't know if any of the counselors have been to up to our redwood springs with is and surely papanui with is a a beautiful park with a spring in the middle of it and it those around christchurch springs are not a nuisance they are a natural asset and something that should be protected and enhance and enjoyed is it and it odd that that that 's up to you but i 'm just-just to wear that and the the report in and 19 as is really what to be honest um it yeah right relating to page 38 1 and so in the supplementary you 're requesting Paul a representative to attend a workshop with the board council staff and representatives of spokes regarding cycle safety on dies past Kashmiris and tourists around I think it would be good if that workshop were able to attend it to be attended by members of the Littleton mount Herbert community board as well on the basis that dies pass goes right the way across to governor 's Bay it the safety issues that were raised so I didn 't realize we 're talking about the other party items as well all rights okay okay I mean I 'm no no um yeah um Kent so shall I address here the Part B items i wanted to just seems to me that just in terms of what the board both had no fear ameed committee board and Spain you 've got bored of raised is that they the board 's really would like to see the springs given more prominence and more marketing so people know where they are and I guess your report really implies an effect while it 's under those issues are under different parts of council strategies and plans in fact it seems to me too though that we it needs some kind of way of making the having a way to have the springs given more prominence then impetus they currently are within the existing plans you want to comment on it to give the problems we can certainly as part of our surface water plans which are our communication documents and what we 're doing with the various catchments river catchments throughout the city is about naturalization of waterways it 's also about bringing the community on board understanding in appreciating their waterways and is working with the zone committee as well it 's about education programs as well and getting 's made what makes up the waterway in springs are one of those and obviously with the various legislation and in the documents that we have which are listed in the attachment here we I staff feel that there is adequate protection and consideration of natural springs and certainly as a part of the development of the surface water plans naturalization process of the catchments they can be educational material at parks that sort of thing put out to give people information about natural springs so to make to kind of give a my second questioning my second question really the club given that that is part of the policy for like it would it not be sensible to to actually run with the suggestions and interest that the community both community boards have by way of staff also being involved in these workshops so in fact we can actually achieve what what is written in the policy with that with the community boards certainly be involved with engaging people around the areas with it bitter springs are certainly an opportunity certainly agree that there 's an opportunity always to ideas about naturalizing waterways improving waterways and that 's done in conjunction with the zone kitni contra water management strategies own committees and I believe community boards have had a good amount of them put into things like the replacement district plan that sort of thing and other aspects of council works so any future work that 's done in the catchments I would see as as being necessary to engage the community and the community boards if thanks Clive and I knowed I was due to come to to the shitty part muy board as well but had to cancel because someone was ill otherwise i 'm sure not speaking out of turn like that sherry papa no he would have been on board with this as well but my question is that then the in the strategies we have already run surface water etc it 's mainly about protection of the quality in any environment etc do you think that if we had a secret policy that we could actually focus more on the springs themselves separate them out in perhaps look at giving them more priority more we 've got the beautiful sculpture and the walkway around do you think the policy would actually help that to occur no I don 't think a policy would add any value about upon wats the stormwater management plans set out which are part of the requirement of the comprehensive storm water discharge consent that we 've got lodged with he can at the moment and the existing storm water discharge concerns that we have which has supported underpin via stormwater management plans which look at each sub catchment of the rivers and identify all the key springs that are there and how we would manage that the development of those waterways in face of future greenfield development Urban Development and that 's something that has been done also part of the future urban development areas so still want a management plans underpin our consent they identify all in all the features of waterways that need to be protected and springs are a key example because they are wiretapper to the local Runanga so you know there 's a lot of interest in natural springs from a wider community right come from de Lucas we made the presentation does she recommended that a separate policy be established it 's free and so do you it was you do it with died right closest I haven 't personally work with Diane I might be good to have that conversation mean because she 's much respected in waterways and around christchurch in natural environment so my question is why has she actually recommended that a separate policy be established can I say that the current policies in planes are quite functional documents and don 't really laughter that a prioritization of those those key natural features like springs so it 's mostly management and we hit the weed management in function and stuff and having a separate policy for these Springs the both the ones that were existing pre quake in in post-quake ones and areas that are appropriate is really important to give them the value that they deserve the emphasis in this and the report is on green fields area areas and not in brownfields areas and there 's been a number of Springs that have emerged number of Springs report doesn 't really address those what we 're talking about is protecting Springs across the board not in terms of future management of future urban development areas only sort of sense that would policy maybe it 's kind of the wrong word maybe what 's actually need is an action plan and maybe what what as a first step there needs to be a workshop between the boards and the submitters and the council staff to work through what that might look like I just think we get I 'm just worried that we 're too focused on with policy kind of being things like district plans and strategies and we 've got heaps of policy but what we want is action and that seemed to be will seek to protect and promote Springs we 're going to pull out the things from each of these that are to do with springs NC if they are currently sufficient together and give them in one document to give it an unnatural Springs document can I just respond that we do focus on Springs in our surface water strategy but we strategies so that 's bringing the three border focus strategies that we currently have under the natural environment program and that would be an opportunity to as we develop the three water 's strategy to come to the community boards to discuss that yep yep remember the pates oh I guarantee that every community board his friends yeah or to develop an action plan oh well only if we don 't have to go a bit to counsel as well we want to add the members of the community and 80 yeah we can just hope we 're gonna tie them we good sorry passed that 's fine wait yeah I 'll just do my part be so back to page then page 56 I i just want to point out that the board is is is going has put some money aside for some cheap solar powered christmas lights now it doesn 't take a trip of people going to china to get christmas lights M be careful city councilors recently is doing that um but that the quotes that the board has been given I 'm just saying quote support is previously been given for putting and christmas lights into trees are exorbitant when you can actually get solar powered christmas lights very very cheaply so i might encourage other boards to to look at that and the idea it 's great 3.3 we we met with representative from select evolution who are developing the adventure park on Weasley spur and that was really exciting and I it 's going to be a fantastic development is going to be in for the community from what we can see and so that 's that report shall I move on to the other report yep um so on to yep page 3 81 and the supplementary Clause 34 we going took the issue that councillor tuna raised around the diet past safety we have very very good presentation from spokes showing that issues we really want to get this done quickly they 're a bunch of blind corners etc we like indeed ta to be involved in that a very much been we would very very happy to include littleton mount Herbert how representatives if they would like to and online and if any of you ride your bike up dies pass and will know people who do that council Livingston does I would encourage you to do that and to spread that around did you have a question got a question DISA gate and I think the survey is a great idea poor and I think we should also consider how we involve the residents on daya space and the other side in there because clearly there will be some of the drivers so yeah I 'm silly supportive of it but widening the way we do a survey if possible and maybe that 'll require some resources I 'm not sure right thank you thank you _"

    "text": "yes regarding haters road indispensable so obviously there is some concern amongst the board the fact that this has been deemed not earth quake damage and therefore removed from the skirt program so what we 've done obviously in the latest medium which we request to speak today about it was actually asked for the criteria regarding why this was deemed to be not earthquake-related and if it deemed to be correct then obviously move it forward and to the two Al I 'm of the now 's good program now I 've looked at pictures on Mike you want that now from Dave or do you want that as a written report to the board what wouldn 't we we just think it needs to be treated originally baby noise obvious so just from your point of view you 'll want it to come and writing to the next board meeting or do you want it now from Dale waiting we 're gonna have it now we 've better than I think we already requested this at the last council meeting tonight what was it the environment community meeting is there 's a lot of right damage on the event is earthquake-related there 's only a limited amount of bucket so basically the skirt program this prioritized over those program what is not done by skirt and not saying it 's not a flake the related by saying we just don 't have any money to fix it by understanding with the specific road is that it has been moved into the behavior program and they 're doing I kept until in trying to do how we were in the BAU program actually that helped me gain goes over a number of years some if not if thats and but my understanding is so looking at you know prioritizing around equal volumes around how much damage is done whether we can hold it and so in fact you 're my understanding at this point of time on this will be done with a minute a surpriser prioritization that I guess the board 's questioning and I have to create Lee Dave because Mike and I were both did a public meeting when the scoop people told the community that 've been told this now okay so what would you like because there was clearly a petition about a deputation about it what would you like to have to have happen on it um ideally we believe it should be part of the scoop program yeah that 's it that 's a that 's what 's going to happen if not we should be aligned with the scoop programming to be done now this is obviously a row to a destination is a very important road for not only the whole of Christchurch and visitors for the reasons of Smith 's filter face pack quite a lot of debate among other Ward 's I suspect but just a are you suggesting anything or are you taking the concern from Spencer fall back to your community board I 'm suggesting that it should be done in alignment with the skirt so well clearly it skirts priorities are set and we can 't change those here is from the road manager is that we are planning keeping the swales this year as it 's got very poor drainage more so sensitive wait while I was not prioritized hire nurses you I better get in the gasket the issue right i don 't know i 'll save it up I think it 's about comms I I think I 've built a good relationship history with scoot I think they do do some good stuff but people just want to know so and it is the saying say what you mean and mean what you say don 't come up with excuses like it 's not as quake damage because everyone knows it 's shocked some of the Rings and it was caused by the earthquake I think people just want straight-talking they don 't want excuses I just want to know whether this is driven by a financial constraint and if so how much money I 'm not as this particular project because if we need money on budget to do the work I 'm happy to move a reallocation the substitution whatever it is to get this work done but I just I just want to understand whether it 's a technical constraint or a financial constraint and look at how think I just want to reinforce cleanse point we hear so many occasions where it just comes out this is not earthquake-damaged so we need a bit of bitter calm strategy from skirt to explain why these things aren 't going to be done and then the normal scare project and that get rid of this this is not earth quake damage that 's the thing that 's getting up people 's knows I think where it 's quite plainly obvious it is but the method of actually dealing whether it has changed and we need to actually be clear and that then that communication once again I just want to echo that because we were at the meeting expensable wind skirt said this is not being dropped off because it 's not earthquake damage and reactions was put it once we get that information be here since we 're in debate in providing comment this is not skirt a delivery vehicle peg and council as the partner are the ones that should be communicating and telling people why standards have changed why things have dropped off we 're responsible the delivery vehicle so i agree we need better communications but that has to come from The Hague and from us as having the infrastructure strategy for the next 30 years to tell people what 's happening with the roads and when they 're going to be fixed and what the extent of the damages so I support there and you 'll be well aware that I 've been asking for us to reduce maps to show people because this is a big long-term project to fix our infrastructure that people need to be aware of there 's a 30-year plan to do it based on our long-term plan and we should be trying to explain people I think visually as to what that means through really clear maps of what 's going to be done by the skirt what 's going to be done by us and actually what 's not funded for whatever time so I appreciate as we water our attention we 've heard it 's not a financial matter it 's a technical matter so that 's good things can be spit out if they came to thank you _"

    "text": "what okay now the first two meetings for the fifth and twelfth a pretty straight forward meeting some so happy to field questions if there 's anything on those two meetings as the last one on the 19th it has quite a couple of issues and Nelson Drago stranded mu I want to move its to first okay moved le seconded Pauline this is the meeting of the fifth of August Part B and C yes I see happy then the report as a whole no questions put that goes in favor please say aye those opposed carried and then the report of the twelfth of August Part B and C move for lean chicken good le questions i 'll put that those in favor please say aye those opposed Kerry and then the 19th of August Mike you want to speak to yes obviously there 's a part a of the air around the Shirley community facility rebuild so this came to the board and there 's some good discussion and we were unanimous and the effect that we wanted to go for option two of my head which was the best way to learn option once sorry which we believe was the best way to make sure that we were getting I guess the best outcome for the for the community so obviously that 's a lets people come in and do a bit of a private partnership with us to get they get really a facility that is more than what we could get with just using the council insurance may of the around 3.5 million dollars sir oh thank you yep I just wanted to add to that to that when I first saw this I was very keen to get straight on with it and just a audit actually having said that it 's important that it is opened up and that people do feedback the reason I was keen to get on with it as an all of the consultation we 've done on this to date the feedback from the community is get on with it and as you can see in the feedback from the community and in fact feedback from John Phil cell that 34 years as long enough so to us so that there were no hiccups or Jonah bars and moving forward with her Kate Pauline was dead to that too he was one of the community meetings about this particular it was just recently was actually hearing from everybody exactly what they wanted the new center to do and cost ways representatives were there to hear about the function would be in being with the form around that and they were really really engaged with everybody and really keen to get this right so that the old center there had many rooms I don 't know how many 15 or something and it was really humming so they know what is expected of the community and they 're going to work together to get this thing so I think it 's going to be really a good example of a collaborative process it 's Mike um I 'll just interested on page 52 number 10 the Shirley community center trust would like to see a council built facility back on the original site- thing as they were the previous managers of the site and is of the facility to this proposal and is there a way in which they can the two groups can work together so they actually made deputation because they were looking for opposite of the second option where the council built the facility and then obviously put out some one to two minutes sort of what we 're done to the st. Albans community facility but i think that limits us for what we can actually put a new given the amount of funding available and that more than welcome to put forward a proposal using option for option one that will obviously have a look at and see waters is the best option but we we just felt from listen to what the community says and what 's what we hear that the best option was to put it out there to get the best I guess the best facility forum for the community groups and there 's a lot of community groups that have used that facility in the past and from all over all over priced it and I guess the beauty of dar FP is we could have a look concern there being a church group that of it will be excluded from it and that will help in the obviously the proposal to make sure that is not going to happen it is open to all community groups how can you do that through a closed RFP process closure has a closed when you go into the evaluation process that 's done i 'm generally done in public excluded you signed confidentiality agreements and you have to evaluate the thing well okay I mean I guess what I 'm really interested in us can you through that do you feel confident through the RFP prices that you can address the concerns that are raised and quite extensive concerns if you look at page 53 around the development of the proposal I mean my fear is that I repairs a closed process it doesn 't allow you to address those concerns well that was that that public meeting where these comics have come from and the support was generally very high and people were putting in more positive suggestions in offering positive feedback it was only a couple of people that ran met when it was still there before the earthquakes have got a real tie to it and I can understand that but crossways a hippy too involved in as well so don 't be too swayed by some of these isolated comments it 's about getting this process right and getting it done it support of out it at RFP process and actually being very clear about the outcomes that they want to achieve the yes the the concerns that are raised I refer everyone to 6.3 lor 6.3 of the report they are much more and more page it 'll be from from you guys but it delivers there 's about 43 there 's about ten identified safeguards that will be included in the RFP document to make sure that the board decision makers are fully aware of all of the issues and leave us these were put in at them at partially the request of the board and our partly on the staff recommendation the board are decided the board are requested that our board members are on the evaluation panel that the decision of the a decision and then that goes to counsel for ratification so we we certainly felt the board had enough safeguards to our cover any questions that may arise may arise indeed I think there 's pretty general support for this can i maybe put the motion okay Oh put it those in favor please say aye those opposed it was moved Pauline seconded le sorry slightly bigger that face right that that reporters hold adoptive those in favor please say aye those opposed carried just thank you very much I think that 's the interview no I just wanted to talk about it another item in that meeting item 10 which Jesus spoke to it start of the _"

    "text": "okay um welcome association um in the september earthquake we were really badly affected out at the air and haders road which is the main road down to the um beach and the camping ground um was really badly affected all the manholes are sort of popped jata bars don 't exist now and we have jadabads where we never used to and skirt have done a appraisal of that and said that it is not earthquake damage and they aren 't going to fix it we don 't accept that any resident that 's lived out in spencerville would be able to tell you that it is purely earthquake damage so we basically just want that reviewed again because it is earthquake damage and it needs to be repaired yeah i 've lived there all my life and i i can vouch that it definitely is earthquake damage yeah yeah brilliant thank you cheers those um sticking up manholes which i cycle over did they used to stick up before the earthquake no no no they used to be flat and we used to have three actual built chatterbug of them are completely flat and then we 've got mounds where they used to be in holes and it floods all the time and yeah it 's just terrible and the fact that you know the campground 's now going to be um run by the council you know we think that it would be in your best interest to repair the road and have it looking great this is the campground does that make the road incredibly busier in the summer or just a little bit busier or what um yeah summertime is really really busy um obviously that 's the only access to the beach and the beach is used a huge amount and their surf club are currently looking at building a bridge it will again be used even more i 'd imagine to um thanks for coming in too it 's good to hear from you actually living there um when it came back that it was not earthquake damage did anyone go back and then say well what do you base that on or how are you you know i haven 't had that this is historic and this is why all these are pictures of it before it was just a straight out this is historical this is before we 've just been told that it wasn 't earthquake damage okay thank you so thank you very much thanks uh thank you so i 'm jonathan hunt i 'm i 've worked in it for over 25 years i 'm with isaac freeman who 's got 20 years experience and dave lane with 20 years experience and care as well i want to suggest to you that secure online voting is a tantalizing mirage trial is a misleading term this is not a trial the outcome is for real this is a pilot deployment with real life consequences the prospect of increased turnout is not supported by the evidence even lawrence yule of local government new zealand is quoted as saying that international evidence would suggest it doesn 't improve voter turnout online voting is not equivalent to online banking voting is occasional not a constant process like banking transactions online voting sorry online banking is not anonymous whereas voting is intended to anonymity are at odds fraud and online banking can often be resolved with minimal impact on individuals or even corporations whereas fraud on an online election could bring the entire process into question even online banking is regularly compromised and banks have entire teams devoted to preventing fraud and just this morning i heard about a hack that i wasn 't aware of that occurred earlier in 2015 that affected 30 banks around the world and in late 2000 in 2010 late kiwi barnaby jack demonstrated tricking an atm into splitting out all of its cash remotely online voting brings new inherent risks compared to postal voting including hacking phishing that 's with a ph and ddos distributed denial of service and any such attacks can be initiated from anywhere in the world security expert bruce schneier quoted from 2001 building a secure internet based voting system is a very hard problem harder than all the other computer security problems we have attempted and failed at i believe that the risks to democracy are too great to attempt it security academic j alex holderman in 2012 only a few years advances in computer security and we urge internet voting proponents to reconsider deployment until and unless major breakthroughs are achieved i ask you here today what major breakthroughs are you 're aware of in computer security that make this pilot viable this is not a business as usual i.t procurement the time frame is aggressive the staff report shows no evidence of the substantial risks being acknowledged or mitigated this is uncharted territory for new zealand and overseas experiences have generally been disastrous australia i vote a significant security issue discovered the last time it was deployed canada successful but minimal impact on turnout and there 's been claims of security issues estonia seen as successful but severely critiqued by independent researchers france fake votes demonstrated netherlands they 've banned internet voting outright norway abandoned online voting spain discontinued not sure about switzerland uk discontinued washington dc that was a genuine trial without a politically binding outcome it was hacked within 48 hours and discontinued west virginia not sure so that 's at least six of the 12 jurisdictions mentioned in the working party report have all abandoned online voting necessary when changing processes affecting democracy council legitimacy is contingent on community confidence in the electoral process online voting changes who can understand and scrutinize the vote counting process and removes it from community ownership and oversight christchurch people have lost democracy and ecan let 's not lose it here australia 's own joint standing committee on electoral matters concluded last year australia is not in a position to introduce any large-scale system of electronic voting in the near future without catastrophically compromising our electoral integrity i dispute the confirmation of statutory compliance claim in the agenda that the report contains adequate consideration of the views and preferences of affected and interested persons bearing in mind any proposed or previous community engagement if this is the sum total of community engagement then it 's not enough and i note that cabinet intended that the public be consulted before deciding to participate in any trial we recommend that the christchurch city council decline to participate in the online voting trial thank you for hearing us thank you um just a couple of questions you said this trial is not a trial binding outcome so it 's a first time real life deployment if it was a true trial it would be a test case and people could vote and see how it works and the outcome wouldn 't be a binding thing and i think when lawrence you 'll mentioned um you know that the online voting doesn 't improve outcomes would it be fair to say that he was meaning on its own i don 't think it 's ever been suggested that online voting is a silver bullet to improve engagement and numbers voting it is however a tool in the toolbox would you agree with that well the question is if it 's not going to increase online voting if it 's not going to increase participation why are we doing it no on its own well then it 's just a convenience you 're introducing a convenience for voters who are already committed to voting and you 're introducing massive risks alongside that convenience i don 't think you 've probably just had on quickly um the other thing is this is very expensive uh it 's in use that 's a new skatepark um we if it doesn 't improve toenail you could put that money into other measures that have been proven to improve tonight which would be again it 's part of a toe box and there 's other measures which would have a better return for that spend so um well for instance one thing we know is that there 's a substantial political science literature on how to improve tarnic and it involves things like community-based direct contact with photos it involves things like uh you know mail outs improving people 's knowledge of the process that kind of community engagement to build them deeper into the process as opposed to a sort of superficial online convenience we would certainly encourage the use of online technologies to make information about the vote more available and to increase the ability for people to become informed and engaged through that and i would certainly agree that we should be focusing on community-based enticements so for example hui in regards to each election that get people together to discuss it as a community and turn the community actually has an opportunity to get together and use some of that funding perhaps instead to build on community level engagement rather than building something as esoteric as an online voting system i see the government turn down auckland council 's request to pursue online voting ostensibly because the number of electors was seen to be too big whatever too big is yet we know uh software or whatever has great capabilities have do you suspect there were some other reasons that sat behind well i can 't speak to those reasons but i did hear on radio new zealand this morning that if this trial go if this pilot goes ahead it 'll be the biggest number of people voting online that 's happened so if that 's the case this is an insanely ambitious and aggressive and i just don 't think the technology is ready we we know i mean we 're we 're all software developers well at least three of us are software developers commercial software developers and the time frame that has been proposed for this is absurd it can 't_''_744.48 i that would be um i don 't think it could be done in a way that would meet the security requirements with the very good security requirements by and large which were listed in the dia 's report for online voting i don 't believe that those could be achieved in the time frame available in a way that 's competent and thank you for the time you 've taken to to raise your concerns and your and your views um if you if you were going to trial an online voting system and given that you 've said that obviously doing it as part of the real election wouldn 't be appropriate is there any other ways in which you think you could trial online voting to see what sort of impact it had and if so what would they be well i 'm not going to come up with a solution right here right now but um the the issue you face is not just is the centralized system that 's telling the vote secure now as soon as you go to online voting you 're bringing every every computer and we already know that over 30 of of home pcs are infected with malware so you 've got to secure the entire system and that includes people 's personal devices if you want to regard the election as being a secure process and i 'm not hearing anybody starting to do it it 's it 's not a tractable problem the the reason that we 're sitting here today is because we believe that the non-technical decision makers who are deciding to proceed with online voting largely in my experience on the basis that we do online banking we 've already explained that that 's a flawed comparison that there is no relationship between the security of online banking and the security of online voting there 's no way to make an ex extrapolate security from one to the other so just don 't_''_848.72 even consider that the concern is that the non-technical people who think that this should be easy have this tremendous faith in engineers to come up with a technical solution and we 're telling you as engineers that there is no technical solution well ten countries and two two pa two um of the united washington west virginia and the united states where they the um the um pilots were abandoned and and however um i 'm taking it from this that in fact because they were abandoned or in that process that people who had voted or didn 't get their vote recorded or whatever in effect became disenfranchised and this happened in 10 uh more than ten countries obviously to people being disenfranchised there 's been different reasons in the different countries and different jurisdictions as to why they were abandoned but um we know that in a number of cases you know there were real votes that were lost um it was it was a case in australia recently where there 's approximately 66 000 votes came in before they discovered a major vulnerability uh new south wales but by the way this morning on radio new zealand if any of you heard the report there was a um there was a suggestion from the people who run the online voting system here that you are talking about dealing with the number of votes was quite small in new south wales um however that i think that was a a great um minimization of uh 66 000 votes being available to um be changed at the time that the vulnerability was discovered in the new south wales election yes yeah don 't know some of these elections came back i should also i 'd like to also very quickly point out that even in countries where ostensibly online voting has been successful like estonia where online voting is proceeding all despite strong technical uh recommendations that they cease using online voting only 25 percent of voters actually use the online voting system despite the fact that potentially everyone in the country who voted could have so that demonstrates that even in the places where it 's ostensibly successful the actual uh rejection of that system is at least 75 percent of voters thanks kevin i just know you guys talked about the correlation between online banking and online voting and obviously online banking uh the compromising of online banking has got a huge financial gain for the person who actually many accounts get hacked into internationally through through into online banking i don 't have those numbers but it 's off the top of my head i believe um sort of two to three percent of transactions are often checked um often it 's sort of commercially sensitive as to how many of those yeah keep in mind that every bank um stands to lose its customer base if it determines if it actually admits because it 's strong the banking industry will also tell us exactly how much they are losing that 's right because of the the ongoing issue it 's probably substantially more than what they report so we do know that the fraud happens um but we also know that there 's you know an industry backing to deal with that to reimburse people to reverse transactions this whole structure of systems we make that possible we need to be very conscious of the commercial incentives throughout this process one question okay if i mean the because your particular emphasis this time is not the kind of the real trial actually is all those the votes the this time it 's a real trial and also through this trial we detect or find out all the potential the problem you know and we try to improve all those ideas maybe the system etc it will start from the 2009 the local government is possible or not based on your your understanding i just say well one of the dangers of this is that this is not a static situation so eve even if there was a pilot and it was regarded as successful uh it 's a moving target there 's constantly new threats being developed the the bad guys and hackers aren 't standing still and this is a is a very fluid situation and in the past year there 's been some really substantial vulnerabilities found in really fundamental layers of the internet things like ssh and so on that everybody have been relying on for for years and years and yet here we find that um there 's been a substantial vulnerability so this is not a static situation it 's not never a one-off thing that this is given the tick and out to additional considerations if we run a pilot which is not binding the incentive on people to attempt to compromise it is minimal because why would you reveal your hand why would you okay yeah why would you reveal your hand if you have if you have potential insight into how to corru to exploit a vulnerability in a computer system if it 's just a trial ultimately the only way you can prove that your system is secure and i actually would argue you cannot prove it because you cannot by definition you cannot detect vulnerabilities which circumvent your security systems i would say that the only way that you can determine whether it 's secure is by having a high stakes election that would then provide a major incentive for someone to compromise the results but i would argue that in most cases you cannot actually determine whether your system has been compromised that is the huge danger so short answer is we don 't know we don 't know for two thousand but no one knows i don 't think anyone knows and anyone who claims look at their their vested interests i was just going say after the dc washington the washington dc trial was hacked it wasn 't that hack wasn 't detected until they added a song that played after every vote was cast and then the officials realized that the system had been compromised thank you it was the michigan university marching band that 's amazing yes thank you very very much indeed that 's been incredibly helpful and thank you for coming along and telling that thank you for hearing us okay _"

the awards and consult with affected engagement I and and engage with affected ratepayers and report back to the council for further consideration bonds on on the butt thing about it 's on the alternative on alternative provision of services which will be maintained on alternative provision for services which will be maintained yeah those are in the process again and so that not team it 's not only some boundary issues between the wards to which will overlap so besides the board 's individual and I 'm seducing a change but just enters the process set for all of the boards or say the board cheers workshopping what they come up with with the staff I 'm sure would be a sensible way for them to ensure but I think as we said before the staff have used that process before yeah with the boards and it should work well this is that as a resolution that deals with the decommissioning because I think this is thus this works this is the second part of the resolution that the three boards be asked to consider this report and make recommendations on the roading proposals that affect the awards and engage with the affected ratepayers and report back to the council further consideration on an alternative provision of services which will be maintained so that that picks up there so have you got the decommissioning one what we would suggest is if we go back to 3.1 and we just note instead of confirming yeah no 3.2 is note instead of a proven not the status of the horizontal infrastructure 3.3 stays the way it is 3.4 goes hang up forgot the first two are noting instead of condemning and approve its night rather than approve yep 3.3 remains as it is confirming that nothing will be removed yep three point four goals will get rid of that okay with that 3.5 you at 3.4 is all good 3.4 is all gone no the new fourth so five yes I 've stays to work with Sarah okay that becomes 3.4 will continue to work with sarah wright sword no you don 't need too bright worth again Aoki go and delete delete delete then the last one is what you had up there with working with the community board okay well 346 goes yeah 3.6 is gone the old 3.6 is going does it and that so the new one is this hagley firme they have the Hagley theme it that and it should be that staff engage with the hague leafy me okay that staff engaged with haggarium a bear with Pegasus and chillin pup annoy community boards to consider so take out be asked and make recommendations on the roading proposals that affect the awards and engage with the affected brake pads and report back to the council for further consideration on alternative provision of services which will be maintained yep yep okay all right clear what number one is it 's just noting we 're not in the stairs categories all over again maybe we should have no notes the proposed status categories yeah because then that doesn 't might actually change that once the it 's been fact checked or whatever that 's okay and note the proposed status of the horizontal infrastructure as detailed yep and just can I check are we going to do anything about the costs and anything about the cleaning because that was the other issue that got raised was the amount of debris that 's been lived and I think that 's a separate issue yeah we 're not removing horizontal infrastructure at this stage no but it 's like it will be something we need to address yeah yeah all right so um so who 's willing to move things it 's been moved and seconded oh yes oh yes counselor Livingstone counselor cotta I 'll put that notion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried and all yep concern Jeanette I understand that there are around seventy-five percent people around the table that it can be rescinded we can return to which one

for I understand that well the massive massive percentage of the entire amount of money available no no no not of the entire fun though of what the fund has been no I know but what is it the twentieth

around the table and I bets all right we didn 't get to it this morning either on the pre chatter so that 's fine don 't worry about it nope i 'm sure it is Vicki but I would have liked more disgusted

    "text": "I 've just put in a wee position if you may wish to consider that just about community boards that you know it can be worked around or whatever just started I just thought following up from the presentation that we had this morning that we should take the view that something along the lines that the Hagley ferry Mead booooored Pegasus and surely papanui community boards be asked to consider this report and make recommendations on the proposals that affect their wards consulting with the affected ratepayers remaining in the residential red zone because Ben Bennett creates an opportunity to actually consult with those 70 odd people that are there and it leaves that with the individual community boards to meet with their groups because they 're quite different and you know I 've met a number of people in the brooklands area for example we 've got no intention of leaving regardless of what they 're offered so and for some of them they 've actually tuned down a hundred percent offer on their entire property because they want to stay there I mean I meet a woman the expense of all opening that I went to recently woman told me that her mother had actually asked Sarah to reverse the decision that she had already taken the offer was said that she was going to take the offer and she wanted to reverse it because you know she 'd lived here for 35 years and she doesn 't want to leave so while it 's a voluntary offer and not a compulsory acquisition this is a position that we 're in and you know i mean i love the what I said on the radio the other day was that you know really we need to be having a discussion with the crown about where the cost should lie because this is not a decision of our making but anyway that 's another another another issue to raise so that the Hagley ferry made beer would Pegasus and surely papanoida community boards be asked to consider this report and make recommendations on the proposals that that affect the awards and consult with the affected ratepayers remaining and the red zone and and it basically that 's to for further consideration yeah i think it is it yeah it is about the effective rate as remaining we 're also having issues with ray players and the in those boundary areas that is truly we 're there why don 't you just sit we 'll just put consult with affected ratepayers okay that 'll be good yet and i mentioned boards because they recognize our ras and it 's through those you knowed ellington bill would your araiza cetera that we 're having issues at the moment over communications works so he as it is so i think if we could include them it would be great yeah to move by Glen seconded by Pauline yeah I just I just want to ask that if there 's like one sensible ride for example of obscene counts as a picture of Evan side drive by the park which is causing ongoing issues and problems is there any way to get that light looked at you know just as even if it 's a temporary kind of basic improvement so it 's usable like bull I mean blue ruffle I just use these roads on a daily basis have to deal with something we can 't use it right because I tried to use it the other day and had to go right around the block you can 't enter avin side drive from the from the gloucester street you don 't know Remos true so you came from my name right yeah hey I mean there 's probably a few places there 's probably not a lot but there 's probably a few that just do need a little bit more TLC just and that interim because there 's high community activity happening in these places so is there any process to do that yeah i mean the issue as the aben side aven side drive so as you know the even side the wine only avin side Community Services Center is still open and I know that the limited services as the proposal on the on the row but as yannis pointed out the I 'm sorry the road status is the top one so you 've got you 've got a yellow line which is unsur vez reduced got out of service all the way down aven side drive even though people are still parking therefore even park and and utilizing a vampire because I understand it 's a full sports field as it yeah and the grounds have been repaired in new toilets and I know that you can say that well everyone can enter their through retreat row but actually they cannot retreat road kuz road but they can 't because there 's just not enough room for all of the cars there so they 're parking on Aven side drive so decommissioning it 's actually not really not really an option at the moment I think we can change there that 's absolutely fine to a reduced level of service keep it keep it open and operating yeah you might need you might need to check that one but anyway I 'm in a bit bit if we refer this back to the individual community boards and they can go through these one by one yep can we just get Chris to talk to so that council and cleared of the employee asians of the that this there 's four parts to this report the first one is the issue that council already considered back in December which was the infrastructure that needs to traverse the red zone to connect up the two green zones in either side so that there 's things like major trunks or lines and breezes road and so on that issue that was discussed by council back in December the clarification that 's the stuff that we need to keep oh yeah right yes Ron so that 's that 's already been considered by council and provided to Sarah the second issue is that the emphasis infrastructure is as you will see in the report is costing an awful lot of money per month because of the service the way we have to provide pump out services for way some wastewater and so on and so forth and keeping services open the ports point is to investigate options that we may be able to put in place to continue to service the properties that are still occupied within the two red zones and there are several options there which haven no pressure sores or whatever the options might be on the last fourth point is particularly around the streets and some of the infrastructure that is not currently being used it 's not needed to service anything being allowed to take it out service by take it out of service we don 't mean take it out of the ground we 've mean just close it off so that we 're not losing any water through it or or whatever it will still be there dekhe in a decommissioned state so quite comfortable with go as the recommendation goes to go back to the community boards and discuss some of those but we do need to give an indication to Sarah at some point who have the powers under the Act to formally close some of those roads that are being inappropriately used and not needed to service the people that are currently in living in the red suit so these provide for those roads remaining open so people can get to them from their property but it does enable some of the roads that are not needed for any act I don 't know if you heard the presentation this morning from in a sour who represents of you know people who are living there he made the point that it 's not their fault that they 're there without other neighbors around them that they 've been kind of left high and dry although they 're anything but I think that he made a very strong point that you know that this isn 't their fault and yet the first he knew about this was when it appeared on the council agenda you know and it was reported in the newspaper so I mean what we 've got an obligation to do is to consult with the people who are affected so I mean it 's it 's a little bit like the discussion we just had on the network 's before on parks is that you 've really got to start from the affected community and work your way up so I mean I personally have no difficulty with the idea that we closed down infrastructure there isn 't being used by anyone where it makes sense Park is that there are other issues that aren 't just about residents you know people who are living there it 's also about access to facilities and in that case it 's a it 's a park and I think that that we need a mechanism for ensuring that we don 't close off access to bet you know at the same time that we 're reviewing this so it 's not just in the context of how much does it cost to provide the service based on the number of ratepayers that there are in the area it 's it 's really looking at the you know access to facilities and that broader sense you know in terms of like the parks use but I think that that we 've really got to go out and talk to those people there 's only 70 are people that in this category and I think that they 've got to be very much a part of what the alternative yeah alternative might be and I just come in on there yeah meh meh sorry that is the intent but we more investigation work because no no one is getting services tuned of this no no no it make that very clear we continue the service here continue to service these people still residing and occupying homes we need to do wee bit more work after this work to look at better ways of delivering those services because at the moment they 've got big services to one house right down the end of a long road and it just it just doesn 't work so what we had to do after this piece of workers review how we 're going to deliver those services to those people remaining consult with them and then bring that back through the back to the elected members so there are different people out there there are some people out there who will stay no matter what but there are others are assuming there are other people no but there are other people who would leave if they were given the same offer is everyone else but there is a small group of them who haven 't been given the same offer as everyone else their land only even though they 've got a house on it I mean can you confirm that if it was a compulsory acquisition whether they were in short or not would have nothing to do with it so that I mean that whole area and the crown the Rio for the crown offer in terms of commercial because commercial head no no no I know what that you offer us yes I 'm talking about residences people who 've gone homes in the residential red zone that weren 't insured if it was a compulsory acquisition would we be allowed to take into account their insurance status you mean us the council yeah if we were compulsorily acquire and proper would we be allowed to take into account insurance status and we were taking it for road or taking it for part would we be allowed to say oh by the way you 're not insured if we were taking it for a road or a park that wouldn 't be of interest to us because we 're interested in the land yeah that 's right so could the a compulsory acquisition there 's no place to play an amount that you pay by way of compensation great so that 's correct and at the moment it 's not a compulsory acquisition as an author I know that remained an offer but is it a voluntary offer when you 've got no other choice oh that 's a question for not for us no no but that was the question that was in front of the Supreme Court yeah and they said that it wasn 't lawful hmm anyway so I mean I 'm the point that I 'm making is that the avira I 'd like to know who would who would who would want to leave if they were offered a hundred percent of the Arabian valuation for their property and who wants to stay anyway because I think how we approach this might be governed by that decision I 'd like to know who who who would go if they would have the same offer that everyone else got or and who really are the genuine stairs and and what do we do then to support of people I agree and in terms of preparing these plans we 've just assumed that everyone irrespective of their insurance status or the offers they 've been received is living there in and has a right to do service provision in terms of the infrastructure the water and the waste water on the roads that service those properties so that is true but what we offer what we are what we consider might be governed by the answer to that question so there needs to be a very personal engagement with people there 's a such a small number you know that they 've got also a right to have their privacy protected too so that 's why I think that we get a proper consultation process through the community boards to really help people and maybe it 's through this community governance or the strengthening communities need to be involved in this as well because this is a very delicate and sensitive issue for these people a small number of people and you know we 're having to make big decisions here ketu is that a lot of or anything there and we want to shut off that infrastructure to protect its fish with water supply where you get infiltration and and you know we have to keep it clean and safe for you so I don 't think anyone 's you have an objection to that the issue is around some of the roads and the and the next steps and how we engage you know that the individuals because I mean to find out on the newspaper that we 're considering going down this track and then the way it was reported you know made it sound like we were considering cutting off their services which we 're not that and that 's good that we 've got that on the record so as I understand and you 're looking for some reassurance that we 're talking about the community letters here and using that information in terms of bringing the issue that contains options yeah but engage in the community boards in that process that 's correct and a part of this process is is the work that we 've been doing with Sarah for zone and the food future use and and so they have been part of the reason for these plans is to inform them what councils needs are within the red zone so Sarah a part of that that process and this was something that was discussed mesera back in May as something that they wanted for their to understand their consultation process that they need to go through people generally happy with the cutting off of the season mrs. in the areas that are not road so if we if we leave the roads up to the individual community boards and and enable the community boards to actually work with staff around that consultation process on the future delivery of other services yeah I for the deputation that we heard around the water so you know I haven 't had any concerns expressed but I do think there 's a fundamental principle that the people that are affected we talk to ya know nobody i 'm not i 'm not sure i 'm saying that the services be cut off we there is no one being satisfied so but i understand it that issue that the individual community boards would like to look at but i don 't understand the impact of say the sewer system you cut it off and ears which not big use does that mean the people that are there suddenly have to have septic tanks no no no no that 's you you 're jumping to the next step yeah so i think so that this correct is a next stage in this whole thing which is for us to investigate alternative servicing provisions now we haven 't done that year so what you 're approving today is for us to go away and look at those people who still remain there to have an alternative servicing provision and then we speak to that those that 's when we speak to the people when we know what we can provide at the life that what we provide might be might be judged by whether they would stay I mean anyway regardless of the offer that was made yeah so missioning X amount now and some people leave well we can be commissioned a bit more we 're not taking anything away it 's just decommissioning and you know that that 's okay yeah and I think it 's good that we 've defined the difference between the types of infrastructure and it seems that the roading is more important to most people at the stage no one 's toilets going to get a feat without there being something else in place in an actual fit probably most of our posts are include by leakage into broken pipes that we 're having to pump out so if we decommission those that 's where our savings will be so I mean what I don 't want to do is basically sign off on a series of maps you know where we were asked this morning to check vet check some of them I mean I know where Ernest loves and he is right on the boundary if he 'd be on the other side of the road he 'd have been green zoned and no problem so it 's a an effect if they 'd put a driveway if they moved his driveway he wouldn 't have just yeah lines on maps are very challenging for people sometimes I think that that the pipes that he gets to his place our main pipes that you 're not going to be taking out anyway so because its service and green zone clothes a lot of those are still I still over summer majority were still overland so we 've got that 's why we wanted to relook at those people who are still there and see if we get a better you know in a more affordable system to them and if there 's one house down the end of a very long road still on the main supply you know it 's it 's a costing a lot of money to keep their running we may put a smaller line and or a lower pressure line because yeah what what what you must realize is that all this infrastructure is designed for servicing hundreds of houses suddenly we 've only got two or three totally agree totally agree but is in a seed it 's not their fault that everyone else is gone and they can we take that out of your mind we 've always looked at this we have to provide services and we will end no no one 's ever said that you know there there there there that 's their privilege and we will supply services yeah but the trouble was is that the way that it 's reported makes it look as if they are not entitled to be the and actually some of them would go if they got the same offer as everyone else and if they were compulsorily acquired they would have got the same compensation as everyone else so you know it 's just you know I totally get where he 's coming from and he 's speaking for you know a wider group but not all of them because for some of them they 'll have already had a hundred percent offer for their properties and they want to stay they don 't want to go at all so so so can we reframe this so that we 're not we 're not approving every single status of the horizontal infrastructure as it is in service for there has to be subject to a kind of a affect checking but in principle that the council confirms that horizontal infrastructure well essentially we want to wanted wording that says there we are we want you to be able to go ahead and decommission that which does not serve us any women and we want but we do want the community boards to look at the roads and we want the community boards to be engaged with the community the affected communities recruited because being on the the edge of a Reds owners is also challenging for people as well when they see things happening and I 'm not wanting to slow anything down it 's just infect from past experience it probably speeds it up yeah take people with you yeah when you don 't it all goes to custard and Liam and the resolution we 've used the word consult is it correct or do we want to engage or is this going to be a full consultation that 's it it 's directed to those people isn 't it yeah it 's okay engaged with the up sorry where is the computational at Caen soldiers when we tell you and I think you gave us a hurry and then what they 've got Sarah can 't see is at the bottom is number four listen the amendment that that means we approve the council it 's the staff will receive third day but we will know what we want to say but you can somebody write up some words and we 'll come back to it can someone just write up some words okay yep let 's just go on and do the crash which is quite Merrill Relief Fund implications do I have a mover for that _"

    "text": "policy and you 'd like to move that Jamie sitting there by Paul as a good thing you if you 're enough you were an elected mean but it would have cost you five dollars so you get off scot-free yeah Annie this rock I just had two questions on this one one one was just um I did ask previously whether this world weather anchor projects in the central city will be eligible so I can 't remember the response but crown doesn 't pay DC 's so well that seems like a real gap doesn 't know so um maybe we should address that salute this legislation on the LGA so so will halving Lenora christchurch sorry what about reaching the Red Cross Church in terms of theme pain if it 's growl and it just talks about brown though generate christchurch isn 't a builder of anything okay well some of it develop our own code in it is it does depend on the relationship of the crown to the project so all those buildings like the night are going across the road that have got governed only worth ground has a developer right okay um ends council bleep a disease we do but we don 't pay dcs for the activity for which the project is providing benefit so and for instance you wouldn 't pay drinking water dcs for a a drinking water pump station take the new library that 's a real tangible title they were we hang DC 's on this Creek and don 't qualify for this roommate and they will okay so everybody get it quick yep I mean well as long as if we can just what team million off the price will be fine and then I was just there be up and running the other question I had was um it was a line in here that said that this will be I 'm just trying go ahead circle but that this will be funded by rights so I thought that was slightly different than what we were told previously so I just want to check what the rates impact will be in terms of these policies yeah it 's the funding is a little bit complicated the project but over time they shift into what is required to be funded from rates so ultimately and they are right funded so what 's the cost and that will depend on the amount in the timing of the funding that moves across from the pool of funding into the development contributions account but you 're capping each of the funds at 10 million for the residential in five million for the business so that funding bull it 's effectively allowing it that 's taken up by rates so we 're basically borek 15 million dollars to pay for this it 's not that straightforward but it really is funded as if it 's alone from rates clean Thank You the social housing DC question continues to linger at me and you 've just said something along the lines of benefits so social housing undeniably provides a benefit and when DC 's are paid by that housing that serves to benefit rate outs yet if we try to convert the equation this resistance from ratepayers to or social housing so their funds are separate can we have a response over housing and there 's no reason why you couldn 't introduce a scheme specifically for social housing and you know you might like to have a quite a narrow definition of what type of social housing might qualify for that and the opportunities to introduce further rebate schemes were part of the reason we thought having an overarching policy with some criteria around what sort of we boxes we need to take me for we 'd consider a rebate was a good idea so it gives us a framework to think about something like social housing going forward and that the rebate would apply at this time of social housing was within the four avenues or it was a small qualified for the small unit rebating if we wanted to push it further that 's another piece of work d risen up and you know there 's an avenue to do that all right t issue that you 'd be debating so every time you do a rebate the fundamental issue is you 're shifting some costs to somewhere else yeah and the one for social housing would be how its current location any housing as a bailar can access a rebate in the fall within the four avenues and also under this proposal smaller units irrespective of how they 're used can also attract a rebate okay at the moment the shift ratepayer cost is shifted on to the tents anyone that will get to that that 's probably part of it yeah so right term I 'll put ya estas one questioned in relation to the residential central city residential DC 's the maximum development contribution rebate for a single development under the scheme is 2 million given that there will be at least one that will qualify for that is that twenty percent for one developer too high twenty percent two million potential to millionaire teen um yeah that cat was something we agonized over in teams of what what number we should put on there as the proposal I can understand that yeah I 'm just wondering if this is the right number uh well it depends who you are and what do you think the right number might be but the reason we we got was that the underlying purpose of the rebate scheme is to promote development and we didn 't want it to be too low they did it sort of not be seen to accommodate that but heaven aren 't there other imperatives inlet I 'm particularly talking about these framelits just be in front and it 's a major one there are as I understand it imperatives within the contract that require them to develop within a certain time anyway so this is just a is a added benefit and I 'm just wondering if it 's slightly high because it means that we 're giving twenty percent potentially to one developer who already has those imperatives to develop and therefore we 're taking it over somebody else who doesn 't have the same ability that 's probably correct and the flip side of that though is that if you lower it they may be developments that we simply don 't know about that may be impacted in and may have a negative impact on my eyes but it is an arbitrary number it 's a suggestion how about it 's do you have a connection yeah this is the debate yeah I suppose it 's steam from the development forum I look I 'm comfortable with that we have it we have approved this and this is streamlining it but and I 'm usually against sort of any you know policy on the fly but to have the cab I don 't a million dollars if you 're doing a development is still a pretty substantial sweetener in my view so I don 't think it undermines what we 're trying to achieve I would be comfortable with depends if there was support from the rest of the table for that I 'm happy that it goes above effort actually incentivizes the development but maybe it goes to strategy and Finance was suddenly business yeah we suppose we 'd need to develop some criteria around win higher amounts were approved or not rather than it was sort of you know a got it that they didn 't and there was no real difference and that her about it it generally be be a million monster to staff but could it and finance that makes sense yep because you don 't need to find out the criteria does that need to be commander than that in and I see nodding around table like majority yeah around that label Syco on comes with them does that need to be mentioned in the resolution I think we could probably just noted in the resolution so that 's noting that for the resident central city residential rebate yes that the maximum the maximum rebate for a single development under the scheme be 1 million dollars and there any potential rebate above any potential rebate above that be referred to the strategy and Finance Committee for approval yeah okay I see another motion I think that is way cool okay good um yeah you 're both that do you want to speak to it yeah okay jaani you can speak at well doing well week at the angel of me I 've got a right of reply is amazing it 's all silly so I 'll li tian ego and then I would just say my butt yeah that 's what I thought okay thank as no surprise but 15 million dollars of rates going into this I think is the wrong approach actually in my view the much more sensible approach is to not run this through rights but funded through the change to our development contributions policy which doesn 't central city developers the cost of relocating a car club or building wastewater systems and winery so I think this approach is actually wrong because it puts a cost on to the ratepayers rather than reflecting where we want to encourage development through the wider development contributions policy so I don 't support the DC rebates as being proposed I think given our financial situation when you when you talk about the priority of funding and we 're hearing about roads are being folks because of broken infrastructure and we don 't have enough money you hear about the other community priorities that people are identifying 15 million dollars at rates and diverse is not something there aren 't prepared to support and there is a much more logical way of encouraging development in the central city which is to change the development to pay for the huge cost of providing infrastructure into the Greenfield areas so effectively you make it easier more efficient for brownfields to intensify and be developed as a Productivity Commission has highlighted so at the moment what we 're doing is we 're making expensive for people in the central city to develop throughout DC 's policy and insane we 're going to top that up with ratepayers funding to even though we 're just increasing the cost which is I think very unsustainable in not prudent so I won 't be supporting this today when it comes easy surprised I haven 't supported this I think this money can be better spent on other priorities and there 's other ways of dealing with this issue Jamie okay I 'm being consistent I wasn 't you 're planning on speaking to it because all the works been done but I will I will chime back the first thing is first and foremost we have approved this we 've approved these three initiatives so we approved the residential rebate it 's been placed for three years we extended it plan we renewed it and added another ten million dollars to the residential rebate scheme we approved the non-residential rebate through the LTP and in July we added the small residential units rebate so this is this is a bringing those three policies together on a workable under a workable and overarching all-encompassing strategy which makes sense easier for the applicant easier for the council to administer and it 's it 's it 's simply putting an umbrella over three policies that have already been adopted one thing I do want to say is don 't don 't be confused by price versus value and well an accounting term you could say that there was a cost to it for the residential side of things for example a real life in good example is the gallery apartment site the pre-development set there and had no people no people there no one going to any coffee shops there anything like that and it was paying five thousand dollars to council per annum in the form of rates post-development you had dozens and dozens of families living there frequenting the coffee shops a sense of vibrancy and helping create a seven-day-a-week city and not just a five-day-a-week city which i think is absolutely critical for any any metropolitan center to thrive so the rates tape for the council within post-development became ninety ninety thousand dollars per annum so over a period of time I truly believe that it 's an investment in the future that most certainly pays for itself and in some the non residential component of this just just reiterated what was approved through the LTP I really take my head off to start and I 'm not just saying that because people often say that in a speech I really mean it this is outside of the box thinking that stemmed from discussion at the development forum which I love because actually asking the people at the grassroots that are doing it what works for you what do you need to be able to get on and do what you do best for the benefit of the city and it was the council really taking a customer-centric approach and not just saying here 's how it works and here said well there 's a different way could do this and and it 's it is business is unusual now and I i I 'm really proud that this policy reflects that because development contributions exist and credits exist in the central city so what the non-residential client did was pull those DC credits that existed in the central city business sign or the core because you pay DC 's when you rebuild zone that 's denser or bigger or better than what you had previously and we we want to incentivize that we don 't want to say bill bet what you had or bill back something person what you had that would be terrible fit for Christchurch it would mean that our all the promise following the earthquake is simply a broken promise and that we do not seize that opportunity so building by building we want it to be better we want to have some more functional we want to have something that we can be very proud of as a result of that earthquake and this this took that that the scales by really saying that and first serve the ones that want to financially back the city in the future there 's no benefit for the people that that don 't want to add value to what they had there 's no benefit for them and it certainly does not suit that person that all that plans to land bank that site and sit on their hands and leave it as a duty vacant lot and in the middle of a city for year after year after year well they decide whether or not they actually want to be a part of contributing positively to the Christchurch rebuild because those DC credits will be used up so it 's it really does say if you want to contribute positively to Christchurch the council in a compliance capacity is making this cheaper than ever before and giving you carrots to get on and do what you do best so I really like that and I I 've had a couple of brick Bats throw at me I 'm with us even from public saying are you know this is helping out investors and developers yes I point if we do not have investment in the city we don 't have a city game over pack up your bags go home go somewhere else we need an enticement city and for every financial advisor or accountant banker that says we 're not going to loan to the amount that you would like in christchurch but we would give you more money elsewhere that 's happening every single day this helps took those stars back in favor of Christchurch the cost of construction we can 't alter it but we can alter this there are a lot of reasons why not to do something and I think this council needs to be driven on what we can do and create reasons to do something so yes it is incentivizing development and investment and people to financially back their City sooner rather than later and finally I just want to say that I spoke at a a property event last night and it was there about 60 or 70 property investors there they weren 't they weren 't the big guns they weren 't the goodmans or the night about in the paper this guy came up to me and he has a couple of buildings in town and he 's had a place in the central city for a number of years and he said that when this policy was approved they were not planning on adding anything to their site they were going to take the insurance and rebuild a very basic building that was there and as a direct result of this they were going to intensify add another story and a departments on top and that 's been testing that was one person that did that and that is the entire point of it does it help them out yes of course it helps them out and I make no apology for that it is entirely the purpose of it so I think it 's a this is about the council being an enabling one and creating reasons to really back your city so look like I said it 's a formality in the sense that it brings these three policies to get that have already been approved but I genuinely do think staff for those in favor say aye as a pro side note it 's carried please record can 't_''_1154.07 see your hands well I was going to make one more point of clarification the note there about the cat relates to the residential rebate yeah the council wants that to include the commercial rebate which has the two million cap as well just to keep them consistent I just put note that the that the maximum rebate for a single you don 't need to you just put note to yeah just delete everything before they 're so yeah yep right next one is the residential red zone horizontal structure thing _"

Lee dedication reached us along the 100 guests with us not only they signed a kind of MoU with the mail to kind of reaffirming the sister city relationship between the Chi church and also had but also you know they have the kind of the seminar business the sector education set and some other sectors the way we were successful the it 's a powder 8 MOU has been assigned for instant like a CDC and obeyed development and the Reform Commission signed mou for the folder collaboration and also scientists the kind of business that the fuller collaboration and the suit render the the color dedication mr. Lee you know another mystery also in a later dedication was the kind of business education sector we presented with us also signed a several MOU in the business sector and also the education etc and also the recently our last week I 've been invited to attend on the kind of the Guangdong Province there the director general of the department commerce they with his delegation came to local church try to promote the quantum the and the 2015 the 21st century the maritime the secular world the exporter similar so Pilate few local I just business education assetid the leaders in the represented particle is one I think this a kind of further the province follow collaboration between us specialist sins and also is where we were be fantastic in here you know I civically international defender give the the newspaper is published the Partridge a stir and a garden city and also particularly no after all mayor your patron here described you and use them that 's where we we can pass to have a look and also they give us the one orders university scholarship to us so a moment the cultures and our sister city the selection process just carry on tile in this one and also sends and technical church as the friendly the city by sent it this way we honor for us so just want to later you know my fellow cancer aware a 2ds of practical evidence for tangible outcome for the relationship has been cable on continually and is a kind of long-term benefit between us so the unhappy you not give additional comments thank you thank you very much Jamie did you want to add to that at all um not a heck of a lot I think Jimmy summed it up pretty well we 've traversed it well also in the end the committee the only thing that I would add is just as simply as Jimmy wasn 't there for the for the final part as I came in with the with the business side of it most of its covered in the report but just more anecdotally from business community to understand what and what a mere does but often most people aren 't aware of they see you come along and cheer a meeting and perhaps make comments in the paper and cut a ribbon every now and again but it 's just the tip of the iceberg for it and I 'm I 'm not saying this to both smoke or anything like that but I was I was real proud I know and actually this not only this whole council I think the whole city can be really proud of how Christ Church was represented over there and and it 's incredibly tough like anyone that you know anyone that 's been a part of us will just will shape your heaven they sell it 's a junket what 's like that it 's as far from that you 're absolutely shattered you arrived there and it 's meeting after meeting after meeting after meeting you finish a banquet all talking duck price with motor nificant that 's going on there and then before you know it you 're up at five o 'clock six another surgeon you do it all again and album ear did it for over three weeks and that 's actually superhuman for lack of a better analogy anyway they saw Christ which is an absolutely sensational place to work visit an investor and the business community that were there not just that the typical for lack of a better word repeat offenders that are there with a handful of people that put out press releases and everything these were from the grass roots all the way through to some of the larger businesses were very well represented over a range of sectors that all have dealings with China and the doors that aamir opens in China cannot be underestimated you simply can 't just go over there and say hi I 'm Joe Bloggs from New Zealand and we 'd like to do business with China they would laugh you out of the room you won 't even get the ability or the opportunity for them to laugh at you because you don 't get through the door so for them to be able to form these connections as as rebuild of Christchurch being an immense opportunity and that these people have the ability to forge relationships over there make their businesses better and be able to positively contribute to the rebuild via their connections and business opportunities that were developed quite simply from having a Meryl delegation there that also would not have happened had we not have been this so it was a real eye-opener from a range of people that don 't get to see that side of what Amir does and the connections which they 've forged and the new outlook that they have on it I think has been incredibly beneficial so thank you me and for we work with us and certainly to the staff to which are amazing Jimmy for being there and everyone else 's who was a part of that delegation Tina as well thank you at some I just want to pick up on what Jimmy sit and it 's not about me but that 's an entire spread in a shenzhen shenzhen newspaper that 's just on christchurch the whole double page spread now you can 't you can was repeated everywhere we went yeah having the having me singing in Chinese and then having their end up on the internet did and it didn 't mean that my reputation preceded me in different areas but I mean I think Jamie and Jamie for what they 've seen but I I have to say that my background experience formally as a cabinet minister probably set me up better then anyone would be for leading a mural delegation and to be honest I don 't think that I could have led a mural delegation of that substance and that size and that significance if I hadn 't had that prior experience so but thank you for your support for all of that I 've got the mural forum coming up and Charmin as a result of that we 've completely fundraise for it outside of the council 's budget so people will be pleased to hear that but the resources that go into supporting that are significant and I don 't underestimate it but the relationships that we build relationships that are going to stand the city and good stead be able to support the resolution so i 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no it 's carried and councillor turner and counselor you know thank Livingston will move and second that the reporters are whole be adopters I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed

    "text": "so there 's back up and running so so the advice the next item is reported the regulation and consents Committee the sixteenth of July we have a motion moved by accounts to the buck that staff be directed to prepare a report to the regulations and consents committee about whether and if so how the council could adopt a policy guiding notification decisions under the RMA which would increase the likelihood of people who are affected by a proposal having an opportunity to lodge a submission so it 's either submissions or a submission so it take the ice off for take the word a out and be heard so and that 's thickened up by tum scanned rush so is there any discussion I 'd like to speak to us just the point of it is that there have been a number of instances and I appreciate report i thought the report was excellent and it does point out the legal difficulties of where we stuck with re may act but there have been a number of instances notably for example the roberts road quarry where an entire the residents a recent one in around cows jr and maine south road and that actually make things much more difficult than they would have had a community being notified at the beginning and while I totally get all of this report and the difficulties that we have here the reason for this is just to look at how we could do this and maybe it 's a matter of interpretation or hair our staff interpret these things maybe it 's not and that 's why this has been drafted together with legal so that includes about whether and if so how because it may may be that this is not possible and that seems to be where you 're headed in the report but nonetheless obviously from our point of view we are very keen that we 're a matter is of substantial public interest that the public who are majorly affected by it get the chance to make their view good yeah I said at a meeting which counsel about organized where the people affected by the roberts road quarry decision came with their local Member of Parliament reality of having a quarry on your doorstep outside a quarry zone so in the rural zone people have an expectation that there 's going to be corryong as an permitted activity you 're not expecting to wake up one day and find that actually it 's been approved for just down the road and over the road from your I think it was a early childhood center or a score something that was just very close to and of course their local Member of Parliament as the Honorable Amy Adams who and her other role as cabinet minister and has held the environmental portfolio so and she herself was was very strongly of the view that people had a right to ever say about whether these things could be done so I don 't think that there 's an intention for the resource management take to be interpreted so granularly that you 'd end up in a situation where such a decision could be made a decent the import of the community now I understand that we 're looking at a fix that it is in a fixed base 's the challenge that we have of in front of us but if we can find a way of guiding notification decisions so that we are those that the definition of what is you know something that 's not less their minor or so our caramel what the Frasers but if we could have some guidance that would satisfy people in that regard and of course that 's accumulated effects and we don 't measure all of the effects of course Environment Canterbury measure summon we measure others and and I guess through a joint hearings process then sometimes you know we would make a decision not to notify and the ECAM would make a decision to notify maybe it would be actually better to have a joined up approach you know so that there is a single notification and all of the issues they 're able to be tabled but anyway I support the resolution I 'm David great let back online thank you look the intent of this report really was just centered around the decision-making process of notification and elected member involvement in this decision making process this recommendation is going but the reality comes back to when we 're dealing with the six and 95 decision that we can only make a decision on the evidence that 's presented in other words the decision maker I 'll just quote from further report a decision-maker cannot notify an application of the evidence points to non notification so what we 're asking for here as a clarification on on what 's minor and what them and whether we can in some manner have some guidance on how a notification in an area where there 's some public consumed can be interpreted in light of the community interest in this thing but I draw the members back to the RMA provisions that the reality is that we can 't make a decision that 's contrary to the evidence presented so I 'm a little bit at odds with it but I will support it and the best thing to see how how we how we do come back on this one if we can come back with a resolution that gives some comfort to elected members in terms of there 's going to be a bit of gray area and this one but essentially the RMA does dictate the evidence is put before you as all that you can actually did make their decision on yeah the interesting to see how this man comes back Jonnie and then term um is this replacing the other recommendation of this additional right well full no forecasters year of the committee put up herb if I could just interrupt again really seven point one two three and four where thee was the original staff recommendation yeah following a further discussion with stuff they came back to me with points127 yeah I don 't think that anything to downwards is in the amendment that I put up is yeah of any concern so we 're playin is one it replaces point one that replaces point one at the surge yep but i think we probably need to take some guidance from staff of the other end so are you quite comfortable that we we come down get rid of the staff and committee recommendation and then take out one hey one we said notification decision yeah yeah so so 11 is replaced by that and if you 're comfortable like you do want to move the whole lot could I just make a suggestion perhaps what I thought was happening was that those recommendations were being put on hold until that further report came to council to consider and then there would be a consideration of the recommendations whether or not 8 yep okay no that 's fine so so you can take out the rest I just have another Christian just in regards to three-point give them then I guess we 're only for the notified one we 're talking about 26 out of 2,500 9630 notified do we have a breakdown as to the ones that are like non-complying restricted discretionary so do we know out of the categories of the concerns you are the percentages in each what can yes we do so I came to provide that information to you um and then just the final question was I know because we 're doing a district plan review we haven 't done a section 35 which is supposed to without submitting subjective Xand what it 's achieving is it addresses the monitoring yeah they 're supposed to be a monitoring report every five years and to the effectiveness of your district plan you know I guess I just have we had we done any work around that or because I recall last time there was a lot of comment from particular I think from developers and planning consultants that we were asking for concedes but Iran was generally getting consent so they kind of Sybil why have you made it so you know I onerous on getting conceals but we 've also got the new stuff happening as a strategic direction so I know it 's a real tension but i just wanted if there 's any sort of other prices that 's looking at if we wanted to pick up on the points that have been made actually we might need to put things in district plan that enabled that rather than just having a hearings panel or a community board or were a commissioner so that there was a section 35 report in will call done immediately to the district plan review and obviously that all that information plus the monitoring that goes on and the evidence from John 's unit around the number of consents the type of consents granted those are the have fed into the material that 's coming back to you through the district plan review so will be reflecting that information with whether as a result of this or as a result of further considerations or what the panel does with the plan that whether that leads to higher levels of notification that 's something that all he works with by the panel at this point alright i 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried the whole of the report well I have a move on a seconder David Tim Yanni um just just wanted to check obviously we don 't have the attachments but as the committee given any consideration where is there a time pro forgetting a report until it that in be reporting to earthquake repairs and what what role we may have as a council that as it dealing with the mb report let 's come out of the poor quality of repairs and do we have a time frame for getting something he talking about the irons report from the other week no no in baby me report it 's kind of report you know the remote that 's come out about the quality of earthquake repairs okay yeah because there are some issues and I think that we haven 't reported it would be worthwhile to have your committee receive a report on that because it sound good I see it you want to see a report on us yeah you can follow that up all right thank you thank you i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried next one is communities Housing and Economic Development Committee and _"

    "text": "Environment Committee we 've dealt with the pate report one number two is I 'm just having a look thanks 68 yep so basically the committee supported the staff recommendations about the upgrade of the roads templeton and also the realignment of another Road so the the staff recommendation was supporting their case okay so can you would you like to talk about is it yep second up by tongue in the discussion Christian on the arm on the pump station ATA it 's two point 12 on page 66 that it says the cost may be slightly more than what ended ta will pay for I just wanted to understand if we had any clarity about what that extra cost would be and how it would be funded obviously it 's new capital that we 're putting into a project and I just want to check it we 've got funding on budget or what the financial implications are I think that that would mean if it was the if it was a case of betterment yani but the staff and afrikaans contact on the specifics of their available an opportunity to divert water back under the railway line when they read redevelop the pump station so unfortunately I don 't have much more detail about that but it seems as though it 's an opportunity to improve the flows um I don 't ever figure but I understand it 's it 's not a major cost okay all right i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no it 's carries three it 's quite rebuild whether water in order to place that option game was similar and that they first stopped the option at one which the staff had recommended was certainly supported also by the the committee the was the pressure waste what wastewater system was preferred because it was the cheapest and it was less disruptive to install and with the only one which in fact we counsel to go funding from endless love and community agreement with their process so this is any questions I have to say this process is a lot better than previous processes are you happy to see connect yep which into of staff doing a good job with consultation and I went to another one at expensive all recently about some trees that were going to be lost and suggested we talk to the community upfront first about it before just handing a leaflet out and it went really well however out of the meeting I picked up that residents asked we the haters road was going to heaven repear clear around the footpath in the road itself while scooter out there and the response from school was no because the the damage does not quake at which point the residents through their arms up and regaled us with stories about how they was standing on the footpath during the quake and they blew up so there 's there anything that we can do to take this forward it seems silly that scooter out there doing all these works and they 're only going to they 're not going to repeat the footpath or the road yeah I guess what I 'm getting it this it 's about aligning the works i mean they when you say they 're doing no footpath boot would really appreciate that Dave anything is that hadis road is a major road within a your luck surf lifesaving club down there a major tourist attraction and it 's a shocker yes we 've got the subs right up out of the road so you could do that usually that 'd be good yep okay good just want to make the point that it 's not just the cheapest and easiest it but it is actually the most resilient I think that 's probably gotta yeah that 's a community that is most resilient sir solution yep so i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried next one 's very straightforward as well council the clearwater would you like to move it the only other thing I just comment on it minute since we made yet decision and is that I would hope that the summary of the next report we get also includes some more information on the impact on the issue environment that it will be useful that 's why we 've asked for important one so me is that year was the environmental part but yeah but I think our recommendation still holds yep okay second dirt for that Pauline so that the time frame has been put back slightly on the Syria report having their consent stupid come to us in October is that correct yeah is it so do we need to acknowledge that in the motion with Sarah and the other party okay so sharp that the recommendations be reported back to the appropriate emphasis or to the two to the infrastructure we just won 't say the next take out the word next okay yep yani okay I just trying to understand the purpose of having wider consultation on her it 's pretty obvious that it 's not a not a goer so what are we trying to achieve by just deferring a decision even further it wasn 't commissioned by us alone it was commissioned by the horizontal infrastructure governance group which is why we didn 't find out about it till it came submitted on the long term plan and so as a result we have to take the time also it became very clear during the long term plan process that he can night ah Who and the Avon Heathcott estuary a hoot I trust and kept Christchurch History Association where we 're submitting on it and wanted wanted to wanted to have input so we 're referring it to them so it was done as part of the optimization process to also save money all through it upstream yeah and basically I mean you know you we 've got the summary of the costs it 's only a pre-feasibility study you 'd have to do a full feasibility study right totally clear though that we actually get to make it efficient dirt and I 've done the optimization program then surely they make the decision not us so why are we even being asked to make a decision basically most of the same in this report so merciless and we 'll come back to your stop amps and what our instructor we would look in the Netherlands and so we 're a major player in the skin yes we support recommended or the recommendations recommended we 're just just put up a recommendation when we 're going to put up a recommendation n seriously one of those harvest asked for more time to consider the other implications around them so the arm of the pager potentially are limitations or benefits that are beyond our interest and that 's why they waited a little bit more time to consider because it isn 't just about our infrastructure it 's the future use of the residential red zone as well so if this were to provide a benefit that then enabled you know some project to proceed you know further upstream you know no I 'll just use the example of the lake you know because that 's the one that everyone 's been sort of talking about then I mean at least this report will have concluded whether it 's worthwhile proceeding with the weather feasibility study or not yeah if I could just speak to it at the appropriate point okay i 'll put the motion okay so i just i just think you know you look at the report three point nine seven hundred and five times is 545 million little line all the environmental impacts I just you know it 's interesting to reflect on the 10-year anniversary of New Orleans I just can 't see the sense in this tidal barrage at all and i think the report actually confirms that so personally I don 't know why we 're seeking further input into it when we should just say actually it 's not a goer now and put it to bed so you know I I don 't support going out and talking to people further on this issue i think it was clearly being driven by cost savings but the report got shows it 's got a huge cost and i think it 's incredibly unlikely that it would get consent at little line felt so I can 't see the need for this let 's just put it to rest now rather than text in this ongoing conversation which i think is going to inevitable end Apfel Glenn well up the our partners especially ikan is the mayor referred to in n no Tahu and we had a strong solution from the involved and they wanted to ever say they told us that and so it was with that in mind that the committee strongly support of their there is why I 'm still supporting the committee 's recommendations okay am clean thank you i attend to the you I trust last night their view won 't be any different to what we 've hidden submissions but they still do support actually consultation hmm so yeah I i was at johnnys point prior to that meeting thinking why don 't we just kill this off now I think it 's madness ready but they do support they have accommodation yeah Tim but birth we knock this on the head now then there would be no need for further consultation with you I mean it 's it 's the question I think that young is raised and I think it 's available yeah well I 'll make the point that there have been several reports on this very issue before and if we don 't deal with it properly it 'll come back so I personally support actually engaging with a can with and the Christ Church History Association because they are stakeholders and all of us the right decision will be made when we have all of the information in front of us I think the report doesn 't deal with the environmental issues if we don 't engage with ekn I Tahoe and even history his cat history ed who tied trust I could imagine a future council having to deal with this issue all over again and I much rather deal with it well and deal with that now no you 've already spoken yeah so I we 'll put the sorry oh no I mean it 's this you just vote against it i mean that 's fine i 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye as opposed say no and if you can record council johansson opposed thank you so is that the oh we 've got the have we got some wording sorted for this yeah so we 're going to we 're going to change it to God might like to comment too because like clearly there is room in the consultation and think they 're pointers you know that they they 've got a special staking us they 've already got delegations and what I was going to suggest no I will hear from stuff but that in fact we still go ahead and do this but that is subject to the input in recommendations from the community boards and I think all the smurfs cheer of the littleton mount herbert can be bored put the case pretty strongly today yeah anyway so the way that the resolution would be that we we approve it but some well or should we shall be that the that you know she said she said that was good that subject to input in the recommendations of the committee boards yeah but then that means it 's got to come back to us doesn 't at all like want to keep the process simple in yeah it would to that andrew i think to address the issues that Paula raised in her deputation it 's actually a little bit more than that I think what it would involve would be changes to the process that we community boards to have a greater level of input so to approve a process that if we 're saying we agree with the issues that were raised in the deputation then there are some aspects of the process that we disagree with just seemed quite illogical I think we we even need to ask for the process to be worked on further and then brought back for a further approval or otherwise we need to come up with some specific changes that need to be made to the process as a part of the resolution today but there are some some issues that Paula raised that clearly speak to some some gaps in the process and some changes that need to be made to i 'm certainly not comfortable approaching approving a process today that there are parts of that are lacking in terms of community board engagement and a guarantee that that will occur yeah the Phoebe that we had this morning at the deputation was that the community boards really need to be bright and at the beginning of the process not after the scope and processes approved think of it so how do we rework this so that they 're that the individual community boards because we also got the message that holding a single community board combined meeting or seminar for all of the community boards wouldn 't work because not all of them come up and they are not all interested in each other 's areas so how do we get some some wording up which means that staff go out to the community boards and are dealing with each one individually and then coming back were they projects go um I 've got some changes to the wording on page 181 I don 't know whether that would be a useful way forward to approve the scope subject to the following changes whether that would be a good way forward or where the staff have got a different way of working that would um would satisfy what we 're wanting to achieve today 181 we 're on page 276 one sorry 16 are one point in the appendix the attachment to to Clause 5 on page starts on page 159 page 161 of the right and it 's some of those stage 6 really is where we 've got the opportunity to make some changes that start to and allow for a greater level of community board engagement except that if we look at the date stages one two three and four and five in fact I 've already been completed by the list of things so stage six is the next part and that 's where we would expect a greater level of engagement with the community board than just to combine seminar and at stage eight for example we would expect the draft plans I would suggest to go to the community board for further comment before going to the committee and to council so that any further changes can be made to those drafts and I think with those changes it achieves a lot of what Paul and was outlining in her deputation and guarantees that those extra interventions by the community board can can occur well so can we put subject to the input and recommendations of the individual community boards yep so are we i would suggest in stage but we 're not we 're not actually passing up Bob what is right well we were leaving the process yeah yeah that 's what I 'm doing approve the process subject to the following changes yeah but subject to the input and recommendation of the individual community boards and in that the draft plans be sent to the individual provision at the draft so um some subject to the input and the draft plans being sent to the community boards for the recommendation to beauty committee if it 's no different from what 's already knows it 's here they want to pop Andrew saying to put the draft plans to the boards to change this and put the dead before it goes to see know what I 'm saying I provide what we 've been asked to prove today bus that meant the process so that in st. stage six of the process instead of a combined seminar we have individual engagements with the community boards yeah and in stage eight prior to reporting to the itty committee and council the drafts be circulated to the community board so I 'm so subject to the important recommendation of the individual community boards and brackets puts debt stage sex and then it 's clear what we 're talking about so stage six is combined seminar so subject to the important recommendation I can 't see what you look like the end of it something on your screen there that we 're not seeing why is that you know can you put it up on the screen oh here we go subject to the input and recommendation of the individual community boards stage sinks save sex and then input no oh yeah yeah yeah okay ends and stage 8 and stage 8 to include referring no no no no no sorry just leave it at stage 6 subject to the input and recommendation of the individual community boards stage 6 so you can see that its individual community boards and not a seminar and then put and ensure that the draft planes are referred to the individual community boards prior to reporting to the ite committee to the infrastructure yeah a referred year for input a refuge to the individual infrastructure train yet so that 's so that 's all and there and put and brackets after backstage at seven and eight and then God yeah yeah Palace works in with the delegations to community boards so effective you 've got us making a network plan draft plan making decisions about levels of service to local parks which parts are we sold which parks are we cared and then we basically tell the community board and they can make submissions but I just don 't understand how the sets with their delegations right like the question I guess was that we heard before was why not the community boards that she did plants on their own wards and and work through all the issues but this just seems like a huge s it work that there 's going to be quite top down to local communities and as that the intent of it but it is too I mean optimize our parks get rid of some build others up great others downgrade others yeah because this is a metropolitan and citywide it 's not I don 't believe it is to draft management plans for local parks only are delegated to community boards but the actual approval of the final management plan is delegated to a hearings panel so it I don 't think there is a delegation that will fix this community board said the delegation to approve landscape plans for local parks and so this will be informing all those landscape cleans and a citywide devon county councillor johansson the as kelly said this is a these are citywide metropolitan our plans this is this is the plan brief the aim of the brief is to get the appropriate input a process that we can all hang our coats on what the plan process comes up with will then go to community boards for approval for input they will go to a committee they are we don 't know what the plans will come up with there might be a range of our recommendations that boards and councils support and presumably there 'll be a range of mechanisms with which to deal with those recommendations some may be handled at a board level as some might be pretty flexibility because we don 't know what we 're going to find I 'm sure it 'll be more than just local but I 'm also sure there 'll be a number of very specific local bits where community boards will say hey that 's our patch let us get on with it Park is an example and just look at the interest that 's generated from that and we 're going to do this across the entire city and I don 't think we 've really got the capacity as a council be involved in that you know I mean it 's see we 're doing representation review we 've got a whole 12 other major issue something where the transition and we 're gonna have a discussion that account so that every little know i think that the message that we got this morning and i think what you 're hearing from us now much so is that then the metropolitan network approach doesn 't work when you 're thinking about how these facilities and parks and RN spacers generally are available and local communities it 's irrelevant 're living around rafita domain what what 's going to happen on Aven head you know it 's just there is a total disconnect that we 're talking about local facilities and maybe the planning process traditionally you know in a business as usual environment has happened and this kind of overarching metropolitan way and i think what you 're hearing is no we want to turn it around the other way around and actually start from from from the grassroots and and talk to our local communities about what they would like to see and then I think your job and it 's probably makes it harder for you is to stitch it all together so that then you know if this is what this community board wants is their then going to knit together with what this community borders as expressing as well and I I think that 's actually although it 's a tougher job for you I think you 'll find it 's more rewarding than starting from a this big picture and saying all we 've got X number of parts then how do we at the moment ain 't going to be how they move around the city and ten years time so maybe maybe it 's actually a good opportunity to think a little bit more laterally about what we 're doing yeah but I think it is a challenge to tie in the metropolitan overall planning with the local part thing in the delegations of committee boards but I think that we are heading in the right direction we 've got some really good examples that I referred to before the planning for the metropolitan cycleways and involve recommendations from community boards is a good case in point in in Bass Pro he lands another so I think you know Council is as doing pretty well it and beginning this process southern fact the boards are more involved so I hope that this leads are there that 's my say okay all right so that we don 't need to sign this off right now do we I mean it 's not urgent if it doesn 't get signed off now certainly will delay the process of the project Ryan well yeah of kind of completely free to over there we can redesign the process so that it 's more grassroots up on a community board basis yes certainly we do the chorus e says we have it you know happy with the the idea of going to each of the individual community boards and getting their input there I think we need to explain toe that we 're not getting down to the nitty-gritty individual landscape plans and known each item within each park that will still go back to community boards yeah as the action plans that fall out of these these Network plans so that local import will still be happening this is more a sort of general policy type live all of the amount of play facilities would provide that kind of thing Suffolk investigations isn 't it that 's all at the moment no we 're trying to keep it up at that higher level is yeah looking at the whole network and how it works together it 's not quite beside ya it 's a framework at the moment we don 't have a framework to community for more things it 's we do respond case-by-case now and we 're trying to give it a much more planned manner so we 're looking at the whole city and so when these requests come on we can we can look at the whole framework for the city and see how it fits in with that framework and then as he said accordingly yeah I think I don 't know that I 'm necessarily hearing why this has to be done right this very minute when we 've heard from our community boards that they want to be engaged right on the ground you know at the start of this process on an individual board by board basis yep a Liam the eye I detect some are some lack of clarity the I detect a a need for a a metropolitan framework under which to make decisions but I also detect a lack of clarity as to the delineation between individual Park Community Board input and a framework possibly we should have teased this out at committee a little bit more they I detected a little too much the V we are rather like to proceed with this or we would like the instruction to maybe go back to the committee and just refine some of the some of the scope and really clarify that interface between community board and and council and that the decisions that they might both be required to make yeah quite like because I think there 's a lack of clarity on what this is actually about yeah that 's what it 's for you know yeah yeah and the time frame as well that Phil then Andrew well over I support there too although and we don 't want all our little Park sending a players can teach us no that 's a whole thing and why it does need also some you know a metropolitan oversight so I think bringing bringing a new a change process have been some clear suggestions a day back to the committee will help resolve this and we are better to take some time to get this right so doing this morning okay also just roast um I almost think should be a workshop oh sorry things that are really important is the community charter that we 've asked work to be done in a complementary currency at all at all ties done so yeah yeah and that leads beautifully in the comment that i was about to make which is you know a network approach may seem like a good thing for metropolitan viewpoint from a management viewpoint but the reality is that these are all different parks in different neighborhoods with different needs different communities different desires and that 's actually not a bad thing you know the fact that a community in a Corral might want something different than a community in even head probably shouldn 't come as a major surprise to us so you know I where is there my value in a network approach I think we need to go right back to basic principles and you know see whether we 're actually by taking this network approach losing some of the benefits that we talked about in the context of the LTP and the activity management plans of getting communities more engaged with their reserves on a local level and made reference cemeteries master plan and that again was a metropolitan approach where the timing wasn 't ideal and that there should have been more input on more opportunity for input from local communities and you know there are some outcomes there that haven 't been good local outcomes I would hate to see the same thing happen with this piece of work so i would say i mean i agree with and leaving it on the table for a further review and bring something rework back to us but I 'd be quite keen to see that review go right back to basic principles of what are the benefits of a metropolitan Network net work approach and how do we avoid losing anything on a neighborhood basis as a result of taking that approach okay so that the report be referred back to the infrastructure transport Environment Committee for further consideration report Pete to the council yeah for further consideration of the process I think we need a workshop on this really though don 't we all that I mean that the Environment Committee I mean you will 'm just going that they can decide to do that though yep all right counselor Clearwater moved and seconded by Councillor cotta I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thanks very much now look could you grab a quick coupler and bring it back and we 'll start again at half-past _"

  {
    "text": "oh I 'm making a comment given that it 's just like these months of the year so it 's hard to talk about trends or initials but happy taking a questions all right Yanni um I just wanted to check you 've made reference to the coastal hazards in stage three and I just wanted to check i 'm going to put these questions through loss last night in light of the supplementary which we 're now going to also discuss today but around the the future transition and recovery and that was around the district plan review i just wanted to check a whether there 's any process by which we can change the time frame for submissions for the coastal hazards chapter given the concerns that people have expressed around wanting more time to understand it and and be where are natural hazards strategy is up to and then see if we had any information about the current time frame for the district phone review and whether that 's going to be extended so it is three can I can I jump on because I meet with the you know concerned that people head around the time frame for submissions the order and council provides not later than 30 working days after the date of the public notice given under Clause five make a submission to the hearings panel on the proposal so the 30 days and the order and council and so what I 'm going to do today is right to the Minister for the environment and the Minister for earthquake recovery who are the two ministers responsible for the order and counsel and and request that there be an extension of time for the submissions now because it 's in the order and council it really has to go to central government so I can 't we haven 't got the power ourselves as a council because of the not later than 30 working days requirement but we are definitely right day to ask for an extension of time so what I 'm just wanted to clarify though is is it the two ministers that can make a change to the order encounter or is there some other process that we need to go control over the order and ansel but you know I don 't think when when the order and counsel was written that I don 't think that they realized that we would be up against a deadline of this nature I mean 30 days is not a lot of time to absorb their amount of information the I don 't know if people saw the press editorial this morning but it was quite helpful I thought to set out the issues that I think have challenged a number of people particularly and the eastern suburbs I mean I received one of the letters myself you know because I 'm in a coastal inundation area but I was already in a flood management area and the rules are exactly the same so you know so I wasn 't expecting I wasn 't not expecting to receive a letter and I think that every single person and the Christchurch boundary certainly not on being financially because they hadn 't been previously met for the flood management areas they that the rules are going to be the same for them the real issue erosion relate to the inside of the of that well the ester e side of the South New Brighton south shore and in a chunk of the outside because all of the rest of it is not residential on that spurt on the on the further down the coastline and in fact the coastal lines are actually not as wide as they were under the under under the e can coastal provisions that existed before so we 've got some work to do and also what I 'm getting is the is the actual wording that 's gone on to the lumps because and I 'm just waiting to receive that but the wording that was put on the lumps makes it clear that this is going through a process and that these it 's based on a report that is going to be subject to the independent hearings panel making making decisions so it 's not you know it 's that it you know that that I think people have worked really hard to try and make sure that people have got as much information as that they possibly from us today to support your leader to the ministers is that not necessary okay and then the the wider concern was around the DPR timeframes and whether they 're still going to be me and whether there 's any discussion the government is having discussion they have raised with us whether we would be agreeable to the time limit being extended I think by another six months so and I 've certainly indicated that we would be interested in there come on it around being extended on that because that 's got a number of applications for us as well in what way costs in process issues well I mean in terms of the process so she 's I mean the decision hasn 't been made yet so it 's a mask but I 'm sure if I 'm sure around one what the proposal s if there is change and in that this the final question was around the natural hazards strategies so my understanding was we have a draft and we 've talked to stakeholders now we put it on hold but to Lincoln with the e came and made a submission on the long term plan and essentially we ask that that be that be joined up with the e kin natural hazard strategy for the whole of the region in the six and thirty two around still has that says that that strategy may lead to changes to the district plan so I guess the question fundamentally as should we not do that strategy first before we make the changes rather than cause all this angst and grief before we make you but we can 't not do it Jonnie I mean I mean that 's why I 've every intention of it I actually mentioned how useful the editorial was this morning we don 't have a choice about whether we do this or not we have agreed to do our entire district plan and we 're doing it now that that he can does the external coastal lines we 're doing them for he can he can are completely on board with what this process they have endorsed this process that we 're going through the natural hazards is all hazards at isn 're confusing to issues of course a natural hazard strategy may lead to changes to the district plan the last time that we did this it took five years to get one change to our district plan in order to deal with flood management areas flood management areas did not come into the christchurch plane the current flood management areas did not come in until the 31st of january 2011 because i think the Christchurch City Council thought that September was done and dusted by them and then there was februari poor I was tryna raises that in a long term plan activity management plan we hit we did have we did have time frames that we were supposed to meet or we 're going to work towards so there may have been a submission from ek and but when I read the activity management plans they they weren 't changed so and it was broken down in three stages yeah I just want to say I actually think that these in oversight with in terms of the way they should we did the long-term plan process and that is don 't proceed with the your natural hazards strategy separate from our process we agreed with that process and we had quite a good discussion about it as I recall he came came and made the submission but we also meet with them beforehand to make sure that this was all i was out work and what we didn 't do is go back and amend the activity management plan so let 's let 's let 's deal with it that way so just in terms of asking for an extension for submissions which I support strongly support nest thank you for doing that I was just trying to see whether that natural hazard surgery whether there was any way in which that work could happen at the same time nice so could an all the district it would be ideal that it could but it can 't_''_575.959 and the reason is is that it 's an all-hazards strategy we already have stage one of the natural hazards chapter of our district plan already signed and sealed by the independent hearings panel and they have accepted the one meter sea 't know if you 've read the decision of the under pendant hearings panel on stage one because if you haven 't_''_607.76 I 'm happy to send it to you but they have accepted the one meter sea level rise that isn 't that isn 't that issue now that issue is around in my view the erosion lines and whether on an accreting beach you can assume Oh crossover point at which it becomes an eroding beach I think that 's going to be the issue there will be a debate around the where the lines such in relation to the to the inside of the history side but i think that the issues on the history side are far more you know that far less open to to those those sort of kind of disputes and people will be able to lodge submissions and maybe i could make this point people can lodge submissions saying they disagree with the the proposal that we 've put forward and they can say that they disagree that the accreting beach becomes an eroding beach and they can say that they disagree of the lines in terms of erosion one or two the 50 year or the hundred-year line they can argue all of those and they can say and I disagree with the signs but they don 't have to produce the report that backs that up until they get to the hearings so you know even if we don 't get agreement from central government about extending the time I would like to extend the time so we could spend more time talking to the community about what the plan actually proposes and why we 're doing it and what the the reporters that we 're basing our best advice on and also telling them what they can argue in the meantime but they don 't if the government says no it all has to be in by next Friday Friday week fourth of September it 's an interesting date there for a lot of reasons but if they have to be in by the fourth of September people can put a submission and say they disagree with the science all of the information can be provided at a later to people myself join forces higher you know geotechnical engineers of your own hire a scientist who can provide some information to back up an alternative position there is a debate to be had about where when how and why that 's this that is the challenge of climate change and it is the challenge of an eroding beach beach line or an eroding coastline when in fact at the moment it 's an accreting coastline and all of the assumptions that are based on it you can own me bass these things on assumptions but anyway somebody here tum and then Paul I mean you kind of said it anyway I mean I think there 's a bit of confusion about people thinking they need to get submissions and have all their supporting data and arguments at that time they actually don 't they can put this submission and then heaven however long those between the closing data submissions and when the hearings going to be hard to get the supporting evidence and is Emily and said you know if they can join forces to hire experienced or get think that 's where the confusion was the bigger issue though is this all very well to say to the community yo you 've got this time frame or one month but if they don 't know what 's actually happening and they don 't understand it then this will go past and they went ahead an opportunity so it 's really our job to get out there and inform them properly because most of them don 't know what 's actually happening and they have been given confusing information around this this particular topic and they 're only just finding out now what with at least a couple of weeks to go before that to give the solution on what is he going to happen to their property insurability value as you know they don 't understand how it 's going to fit their property and the future so that something we need the value of my property hasn 't changed an inch not a bit even though I 've got one of those letters and the thing is is that value and insurability have got nothing to do with a lot of people judged to be the risk and with a people judge to the wonderful beach environment to livin with lines on maps have never changed value if at all due respect we got told and we only found out at the briefing we go to the community that some properties will not be able to actually redevelop pass what they currently developed on so if you had a piece of land with a check on it you can 't build in one video you only found that out at that we found that up no sorry that was the whole basis for the coastal zone one zone one you only can redevelop and to the footprint that you have now that 's what someone does the community didn 't understand it no I know but you obviously didn 't understand it but you were at the movies thing that decided it it 's not comply it 's not complying but it 's not prohibited you can still apply for it yeah just suggest that I don 't know if we 've done this but could we any live streamed yes folks we have one sitting there now because this is that is dear it is there yes so if we can go we deliberately live-streamed the presentation so that people could go to it and link to it great and I mean I went away and link to it on my facebook page i assume that everyone else did and so that still there I haven 't cheap so that is good for people to know because it 's Paul saying its people still struggling to to get that information and I mean you know we know where to find it but a lot of times people you 're quite right look I think that if we could have a little bit more time just to take the heat out of it because actually once people understand that it is not a prohibition on development it is not a you know sort of secret retreat you know option that we 're we 're imposing on people that what it is is that it is the science that has been utilized by the council the you know a proposal for the coastal erosion and coastal inundation lines I mean the interesting thing as is why it took four years for us to put a flood management here Aaron I mean wide alert because people went off to court in Fort it over and over again but at the end of the day the council had to operationalize the areas that were exposed to flood risk and we did and guess what nobody 's property values went down because we put in a flood management area between two earthquakes and in fact I mean a mini respects the the risk that we would be facing as a city in terms of flood risk you know despite the unlawful nature of the residential red zone if the crown hadn 't done that we would be dealing with thousands of properties it would have been exposed to in way more flood bruss than they were before the earthquakes thrown away we 'd be remiss not to give this information out to be we have to we have to give it out so she can be wrong lunging for the problem to educate people and is Paul and yanni have highlighted the an accuracy of information telling people they can 't do something when it 's a not it 's a non permitted activity and you know you do have to be sitting on a council sometimes to understand that a non permitted or non-complying activity is not a prohibited activity you just have to apply for a consent to do it and what the council will be looking for as as what have you done to mitigate against it so and they 're in bed I mean it will lead to changes and the way we develop in these areas you know people will put on houses that are basically able to be moved you know people will put on you know different methods for for infrastructure support you know because of the risks of the vulnerability of that environment for putting in you know hard hard wired infrastructure I mean I think the pressure sewer systems are down rocking horse road and you know and I mean the I 've had hugely positive feedback from communities there because they hard wired and for structure that took a long time or would have taken much longer to repair it is around those speed when these people this is getting rushed through at a time you know where these people don 't quite understand the pressure you but don 't use the word rush through as I say the only thing that 's rushed is the 30 working days that 's the legal timeframe for making a submission they don 't have to produce the evidence when they make the submission there is there are months and we will don 't understand without he just stunned to come to understand what it means these theories nobody 's live stream so hopefully they 'll get ya what the question about what it means though you know there are properties down south shore that don 't have insurance for flood now you know and actually they haven 't_''_1240.33 for years but those people self-insure and this is the thing that bothers me is that unless we keep working with the insurance industry they 'll make those decisions for people and I 'd much so they still have access to insurance and by taking mitigation approach to to to hazards that we face then we can keep that relationship going and that 's a good thing but you know people who got houses on the beach you know I you look at you look at all around New York where you know hurricane sandy hut you know there have been places that haven 't had insurance for years and years and years the value has retained the houses just keep getting built bag so and that 's not what we want to do in Christchurch we want to support people and the environment that their own but we don 't want to intensify development in areas where we know that there 's going to be future for us just we support you on the extension but it 's even to producing this submission in that time frame is enough for people so I think not with sending trying to come up with any evidence so if that 's causing a lot of upset but just to lodge the submissions saying I don 't agree yeah yeah tough time oh um we 'll deal with this issue fees so David day yeah I cars just kind of support the move to extend the the period for submissions and editors quite evident that it 's imperative to actually get a submission in in some form or other in this the space I think my opinions on this subject are well here but I do still have a concern about the coastal frontage and it for me it comes back to property value and whether whether or not we are keen to actually promote anything there and I think you know this if the property values were a hell of a lot higher than they are we probably wouldn 't be attacking them this situation as we are now part sameer avail were in Pendleton we 're rebuilt because the value was high and I wouldn 't want to resign red zone them so I think we do have an attitude issue with the eastern suburbs in there and it this is unfortunately come from staff at times that the value of the properties don 't warrant a lot of work to be done there 's a lot of attitude problems there 's a lot of misconception and I 'm very keen to see that the implications of the coastal hazard zones and flood management areas are properly understood I don 't believe they are at the moment and we 've got a fair amount of work and a large group of people out there now that are feeling quite aggrieved in some instances i think it 's well-founded another it 's probably a lack of understanding of of the situation but we 've got a huge problem on your hands learning yeah well I 'll just I don 't want to add to the confusion though the residential red zone decision was about the value of the properties it was because what the what the crown was looking for was first of all the I don 't know if you remember them talking about it but the crust it 's the height of the water table that 's the issue and of course liquefaction risk it isn 't just about the the type of soil it so if you 've got a thin crust between the water table to the surface where your houses then that obviously is going to take a different approach to you know the type of house that can be really built in those areas and that wasn 't taken into account you know I mean I just remember going to that first meeting that Pacific well and Bixley after the sep tember earthquake where all the older people said we said they should never build Pacific part you know I mean they knew they knew about it so we had unreinforced concrete slab foundations built on the edge of a wetland susceptible to liquefaction and lateral spread imeem it 's just diabolical but the government when it made the decision it said how much would it cost to to knock everything down tear up the infrastructure basically prepare the land again and rebuild and what 's the value of the sections at the end of the process that 's why they use the 2007 rating valuations I would recommend that you read the cabinet paper that made the decisions on the of the land actually made it more cost effective to buy people out then it did too repair and rebuild the whole lot so you know it was a decision that was based on the value but that was not a council decision that was a crown decision and it is something that on one hand we 've dealt with a person today who 's you know stuck and a no in a position not others making and on the other hand we as a city would be dealing with thousands more properties that were exposed to far greater flood risk than they ever were if the government hadn 't intervened that 's the truth of it then you talk about the crust and things and molokai love a block away from the beach and and all the earthquakes we 've had no liquefaction whatsoever and this color match its soil and rough with soil types yeah but San doesn 't liquefy yeah so I mean the whole of that coastline strip including South Shore apart from the history frontage but all we 've all we 've proved is that understand and actually we 're some of the people that don 't understand all of this oh great well and I think it 's been hasn 't_''_1655.019 been greatly elucidated to our communities some of the technicalities and I think we 're just heading for a wee bit of it two more yeah but we are in a legal process that requires us to ask the government to assist us unless regard me to me I see driver the hands going can we just receive this report and maybe in future Queen of decision papers at the start of the agenda because this is interesting but I kind of feel it 's not the place for you and we 're just spending a whole lot of valuable time and we won 't make a decision before yeah no I 'm sorry yeah that 's my fault though mine was different point area in just a quick point that an on page 46 get Kelly or Kelly 's reporters reference to the processes for the unicycle wrote an involvement of that the joint was joint committee meeting with the three community Colleen on how that process is worked as very good example of when the community boards are involved early on and make recommendations around a metropolitan issue like a net cycle we 're in fact this part it was working very well thank you yeah alright so can someone move that the report be received it 's just around them construction and rebuild right across the city there 's a lot more construction going on as we know but it 's actually the the Roberson comes off those construction sites obviously you know you know not such an environment we 're working on the moment that 's not such a problem but when you 've got so much construction a lot more debris blowing around we need to have more control around some of those construction slice to make sure they contain your rubbish all right so come look I mean I 'm going to take Jamie 's points so Jamie you want to move that it be received Jimmy you want a second that one question I 'm crazy on page 53 got into the Grateful High Church particular this one my understanding that 's where we going or try to assess all the process technology use people time text and also the performance host that 's a fantastic but I just want to know whether we have any plainer regarding assessment seeking the international accreditation like ISO 9000 series or night is all is all the 14,000 series this international standard is my question and not at this point so our process really has been to use different well known techniques such as lean and Six Sigma and in terms of and beating those tools within the organization so that people can mean start to look at their own areas and areas that they may improve so just become part of our everyday business I met at some later stage you could look at you think something like ISO 9000 but at this point it 's it we 're really at an early stage of improving our processes their efficiencies and proving our customer journey inexperienced to say that there 's much more consistency and the experience that people receive I 'm going to put that motion all 's carried next item I want to want to take a couple more not obvious what I 'd deal with this so _"

come up with hopefully we 've got an amendment worked out on 8.1 yes it 's basically what we consider them kelsey 's may want to add to this or to treat from battle it 's that we ask staff and we mean the community engagement staff the property staff and strengthening communities to work with the community board to consider the wider possibilities of the use of buck and park including a space for community group meetings and social gatherings and like that could be another with that can be wider because clearly in this move will tell you about lack of space but the other part two is with the Sikh society the pseudonym quarter in the local businesses Oh so what I think we need to what I was aiming it is that we give the board a steer on the purpose the purpose of what we wanted to do that

find a mechanism whereby we could get some more options on the table at the moment we 've got the unusual situation where the community board adopted a a position which they 're perfectly entitled to do but it was coming back to the council for a final decision and that was because we didn 't have a delegation I personally favoured delegations for these kinds of issues there isn 't a view that you university held so rather than create an individual delegation we we need to deal with delegations as part of the wider consideration of delegations to community occasion is too and what happened was that it came various interests wanted to make deputations to the council meeting on the day that we were to make a decision I think that is a that is the worst possible process for decision making because just those who ask for deputations are the ones we get to be heard and that doesn 't mean everyone gets to be heard so I referred it to the infrastructure transport and Environment Committee which came up with a different position than the community board so after our discussion this morning there is quite clear that there 's a lot of support for helping the New Zealand sick society South Ireland find a resolution to their situation building on the current site is probably not the best outcome for them the community are there better options than the one that 's being proposed we don 't know because other options haven 't_''_235.0 been put on the table and that 's what we 'd like to refer back to the community board as to look for other options so that all of the options can society so it 's really to open it up at this point we don 't want to resolve to delegate the decision making to the community board and that is largely because we need to have that broader consideration around delegations considered overall across all community boards rather than are on an ad hoc basis case-by-case so that 's that 's my summary of it do you want to do you two want to speak to it first or can I invite paulandcarolyn to speak yeah I 'm well obviously I would I support the board 's original decision and I stand by that and I think that we made it with in good faith with the information that we had yeah I really don 't want I don 't find that really helpful pool and that 's what I tried to have communicated to you beforehand sorry I was just kidding we were just having a discussion in about predetermination getting options on the table as as what this is about so standing by an original decision isn 't that isn 't an option there isn 't the only was I 'm finish the sentence you thank you I k she ate that but obviously the more information that we have at the bitter end that there is a sense of division within the community in a better consultation process would hopefully help sort out some better options and I in the resolution I was going to suggest some modification of it if you 're going to mention units of the council please mention our community governance team we have an excellent community governance male we called it community engagement but it means community government sorry I 've just changed engagement to governance and you know I mean I would still like to request a delegation but I do understand the broader principle you know the it because it extends the process up for a much longer period of time it counts back to the board and then is it going to go back to Council to the committee now it 'll come back to that accounts will come back to the council but but but we think that what we want is a is a good process you all of us feel that there 's probably a 1-1 out there somewhere and it 's not on the table at the moment do we want to put a time frame on this say six months or so that it doesn 't get to the poor thing to be concerned about the time do you think there 's a preacher oh it 's just just um just screwing the process now I understand it I 'm happy to accept what sound in front of us yeah well I mean sooner rather than later but were to run a good process doesn 't necessarily help bring a time frame on it yeah yep so do you think that will be okay for the community board no I cannot great yani there was I think Carolyn you made some dictation around some of the historic things that were in this park ah and I just want to save that as you have been addressed oh yes the staff always had the information about the cultural artifacts it 's just that they didn 't come to the board at the time about decision the development of the 77 new apartment housing on the pseudonym school may see the restoration of the CID nematic expect to their original environment maybe but they can formed out of the proceeds very good all right so that 's been moved and seconded is there any discussion I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried pink look thank you very much and thanks for your efforts there _"

    "text": "it 's the next deputation is in relation to an item that we 're going to discuss immediately following because we both at the same time could I invite in a Cell to come forward and we 'll deal with his deputation on the residential red zone horizontal infrastructure item 14 thanks Dennis welcome I 'm a resident that 's currently still living in the residential red zone and I 'm also representing the group quick outcasts and I 've start with the red zone is illegal unlawful as the curb I has declared by the High Court in the Supreme Court agreed and because the government failed to consult with the people and unilaterally declare and instituted the residential red zone outside at all so now we have this big mess today and the courts all read that the government had a clearance program and failed to properly compensate us namely the uninsured property owners at this stage it repeatedly made threats about reduction and cutting off of services which is what I 'm going to talk about today I 'm the courts agree with us that the office a Hobson 's choice you can have any horse you want as long as its nearest to the gate so I 'm sure a lot of you might ask why do we have no insurance and you know it 's your choice that 's why you 're here today but I can tell you it 's not a matter of insurance I want you to consider this if you own if you spend your own money to make repairs on your own house after the earthquakes what difference does it make if you spent your money or you spend the insurance money so the government has no right to come in and say I don 't want to compensate you for your house but I just want to pay you for your land and you can get out of here so you can see that a lot of us are put in a very difficult situation we have no choice but to stay so I 'm here to ask the council please consider the remaining residents with compassion and understanding that were not here by choice and so the horizontal part of the government 's squeeze and us to make our lives difficult to quote mr. Bromley song words so I think there is has been an overemphasis on the costs associated with this and we feel like we are being blamed at where victims and we 're being blamed for the costs and it it 's not our doing we have no choice we didn 't cause the residential red zone to happen we didn 't cause for the vast majority of our neighbors to move out we didn 't cause any of this to happen and so I want to point out a couple of his shoes first is that there are some inaccuracies in the appendix and the maps particularly the status or definitions of these maps personally I think some of the definitions seem a bit subjective in arbitrary particularly the definition around what 's temporary and what 's not and I think I 'm speculating here but possibly there might be some intentional understating of the actual conditions of these infrastructure and that would that might make it easier for the government to justify future council please do some fact checking and before approving points 3.2 and 3.6 throughout the section of the report that it seems like there has been a preconceived notion the been put into place I 'm guessing it 's from the central government and some elements within a government definitely wants to reduce the level of existing services to residents that are still working and functioning for example my house is on a permanent sub main water supply ever since the big one and it had never failed after the eight weeks initial earthquake and no service issues no pressure issues no contamination issues I I did regular chemical biological and dissolved solids testing on my own water supply and there is no contamination whatsoever that I know of so the concerns for possible contamination can be said to be a little bit overblown I 'm sure it 's it might not be the same case in every in every household but at least some places this is not a concern so I asked the council please our staff members to do some more checking instead of just blanket Lee around residents that are still remaining in the red zone taken without closing of roads might not cost might not save that much cost since nothing pretty much nothing is or it is being done at the moment closing unnecessarily large mountain roads can only cause further alienation to the residents that are still living here and it serves as a reminder to us that we are not welcome to live in this neighborhood anymore so let 's go back to the water supply issue I think part of the report said missioned talking in water tanks may be a cost reduction measure but what about fires the fire engines servicing metropolitan city areas need a working fire hydrant to fight fires and they are not equipped like rural fire engines fire appliances so that 's that 's definitely a safety concern to residents that are still living here I spoke with a staff member at Council regarding fire hydrants on Street fire hydrants that have not been properly maintained or marked by yellow paint and hasn 't been for a number of years and I 've just recently not member had promised to get contractors to properly mark these fire hydrants so 2 r it 'll grow back into a rural style service of trucking in water for remaining residents and not only poses a health threat but also a safety fire a safety issue as well statistically tank truck in tanks and of water have a high chance of contamination so to sum up anything anything any policy dis decided based on the unlawful residential red zone can be said to be unlawful as well in some degree I employed a council to consider its moral in ethical obligations and not just the legal minimum legal obligations to residents please do not put economics before compassion and do not be the government 's puppet we have suffered more than enough okay um just I want to pick up your first point which is that if you were if you if you were on the other side of the road you 'd be in the Green Zone and if your house was and I 'm sure you could have had a except for what was minor damage to it or not so wise insurance the bigger shoe and determining whether you 're getting paid a fair amount of money or getting a lowball offer insurance is not an issue and that 's agreed by the courts this the Supreme Court made it quite clear that insurance was a relevant consideration but given that not everyone was uninsured I mean people I mean it sort of made it sound like it was everyone 's fault for not being insured but it 's irrelevant to the decision if you are compulsorily acquired wouldn 't matter with your insured or not what it no no I want to put this analogy to a council if if there is an epidemic tomorrow and everybody got the flu a bad case of it and the government comes in and says do you have any health insurance if you don 't we 're going to reduce your lifespan by X amount because you obviously don 't care about your health you didn 't purchase private health insurance does that make sense or probably a better example would be we will only provide support for people you know protect against the particular thing that happened but what they 're missing the point is is that you don 't take out insurance against the government you know wanting to voluntarily acquire your house after a disaster you take out insurance because something might damage your house to get it folks but as you say you could fix your house if it was on the Green Zone exactly yeah I 'm Glenn and then Ali okay thank you thank you and as for this obviously you 're saying 3.2 and 3.6 make sure of the facts do the fact-checking by the council and so I 'm very keen that the community boards are involved and the residents associations with thank you Mike upstair so how would you like to engage over this process will continue to engage the report says there is only 74 households in in there is a neutral red so I think that we can all put everybody in one room and everybody knows their neighborhood quite well and we can all check check the maps you provide the facts yep umm Ali quickly it did in 2014 to keep services into the residential red zone for 70 to 74 residents what do you say to people who say that that is an unfair cost on the rest of the city well we didn 't cause this like I said and assuming that we accept the accounting methodology an accuracy of this number it 's the government the numbers that you just quoted the other costs then it was the government the central government that essentially costs the residents to move out and so statistically reduced and the number of residents still remaining and so artificially inflated that per household costs so I think we should ask the government to front up and put most of the bill if not all of it because it caused the problem not the residence yeah I think that some I think that we came when we get to the particular paper to actually not make the decision today but to refer to the two community boards which are hagley ferry Mead and booooored Pegasus in order to actually do that that fat chicken and to look at some relate to the residential occupation either you know because you know one of the parks for example needs to be accessible you know as well so surgeons around roads and relation to that Park you know you wouldn 't cut it off because there isn 't enough there isn 't any residence down there but you might want to keep it open because actually that improves access to the park so you know there 's quite a bit of work to be done around these things that 's easy to look at max and then think oh well that 's okay because there 's no one there or whatever but actually this that there are consequential effects and we think by engaging the community boards and that process and as you say the 74 could fit in a room it would be quite easy to understand what needs to be done in those areas in conjunction with the affected residents because I mean I think the point that nobody 's made is that you all pay rate which means that you you know you 've got you 've got a from your relationship with central government in the decision that they made which was not a decision that the council made sorry I 'm with well over the 10 so but thank you very much and we 're going to we won 't deal with the paper right now we won 't deal with that item now but I 'm sure be assured in us that we 've heard your plea _"

    "text": "right Paul of Smith thank you deputations in relation to item 8.5 project scope and process the three Network plans thank you for 3.net group plans it 's in the report of the infrastructure transport and Environment Committee yep great that you 're deciding to prepare these Network plans for sports parks playgrounds and marine structures and I gather there 's a fourth being prepared for community facilities fixed a bit surprising that it 's taken so long for these to start to be developed taken together these assets are fundamental to people 's well-being in our community I can totally see the need for comprehensive consideration of all these facilities as citywide networks but the way you but the way you 're going about it is all wrong it 's a top-down process it 's a top-down management approach when what is needed as a bottom-up governance approach community governance approach it 's the opposite of community governance at the last election there was all this rhetoric about empowering communities and their community board representatives to do grassroots community development to plan our own environments and halfway through this a change in organizational culture just this week community boards are starting to talk about our community plans I see in stage six I would have sorry I would have thought that step one in this process would have been to have a conversation in each community with people who use and care about these assets with community board there as well and issues and options gathering stage a brainstorming session if you like all these facilities are very important to our community and to our community boards and these network plans will determine which will determine funding stretch out for the next 30 years that 's going to make it really hard for community boards to get anything happening that is outside what has already been planned we 've struggled with us for years and there 's another problem too as I understand it the preparation review and change for management plans for parks and reserves is delegated to community boards and I 'm not sure that the process it 's outlined in the report can the chem can work like that without rescinding that dedication so I just you for your deputation your comments which I think are really important for this council and I might you 'll have seen that on page see we get what the committee besides proving the scope of them oki that we ask that boards input be sought following approval for the scopes so just what I 'm wondering how how would you like the process to be so that in fact the board 's input is considered as soon you know right the beginning of that stages so maybe the board 's input should have being sought before the process was set down so clearly in a report that 's coming to counsel about how the process should be done I understand it fully and I I 'm hoping that as council we will find a way to make sure that that still happens the other thing I point out is that engaging with communities that combined community boards seminars is one of the least effective ways of communicating with community boards they 're only attended by a very small number of people thanks for breath thanks Paula so I mean community led planning could actually work I mean are there any examples we 've got new community governance managers we 've got all these staff that are able to do that and I suggest step one is to get all the people and within our wards do it on a wood basis together in a room and talk about talk about you know what what people care about and then that process should inform the metropolitan planning process it shouldn 't be the metropolitan planning process telling the communities what 's going to happen hmm yeah I mean I completely agree the question is trying to find yeah with respect to the management plans maybe they need to be done in Ward bundles so that the community boards can actually do what they 're delegated to do rather than being done as a whole collective I mean it was a problem with the cemeteries master plan is that that was done as this metropolitan network thing and it was just given to us like that and people care about these reserves they care about the community facilities and it just i don 't i don 't think that there was an intention to to do this that it does look to me like it 's a kind of a BAU process that 's come through the system it wasn 't directed by councillors it 's comes through the process that 's been signed off it talks to community engagement through the community boards but actually you 're quite right it 's around the wrong way it 's so it 's me Patricia this is how do we how do we turn it back the other way he only has a question too but I just wanted poor if we approve the project subject to the input of the of the committee boards with it you turn around it was me fine ya do ya I think the issues that were being asked to approve the project skypes and then asking the community words what they think which seems back to front and that 's the committee recommendation but I was really interested in just understanding if you could directly from the new contractor our board ez 'n of that the gourds felt that that was quite a it was a positive step in terms of just understanding what was happening in some of those local areas because this is I mean this is about levels of service as much as anything else so I don 't know whether you guys have had that we have London we 've got we 've we 've got some problems in merging with the new country do a sweep do you think it 's important to engage the contractor date in this process as well we are talking about sports parks and when you 're talking about neighborhood little moments he said would be all right so look thank you very much poorer of I think you 've made a very strong point and one that I think you can hear from counselors that we 're very keen to support and it looks like we 'll find a way through that will change the resolution to meet those needs thank you thank you I 'm _"

    "text": "okay and pride in representing the people of memphis this particular action is setting up a petition was born out of the outbreak of communities there 's no action to be taken today it will stop the closure itself for good parts of your life like most industrial hubs in new zealand in the last 50 years they 've seen an appointment outsourced to lands and cheaper labor and so a large group of people who i came into contact with while spending time on the streets of course and gaining signatures for this movement the ones who call wilson home with an emotional attachment for all the members of this class who have memories of the different village center and have been using the service for years she is in a place to pull the service in the areas of disgrace and the product of an untouched government that is not acting in the interests of people these people were elderly these people don 't have a lot of money and these people have had enough some of these people don 't have access to computers and some travel they 're not asking for more they just want what is have easy access to postal services to write letters etc to their loved ones now on a macro level the closing of this post office may seem small and we know it 's taking place across the country streamlining a service into a corporation that will probably be flogged off in the next fire sale but it is a symbol of our times and i heard on two separate occasions from individual elderly ladies that they were glad they were old because they didn 't have to put up with the crap for much longer a tragic state of affairs i spent two days in in woolston and received 240 signatures and i genuinely believe with a week there it would have been over a thousand and i went through all the businesses in the area who are gutted and they 're asking questions if we want investment in woolston how how is it a good look for public investment to be pulled i also met the staff from the kiwi bank and the post office there and steve their treatment of him they said thank you steve for over a decade of service to us you 'll be given three months notice and if you want to work at the kiwi bank at ferrymeet you 'll have to go through the application process now before i finish i 'd just like to thank bridget rutherford in particular from the christchurch star company for bringing coverage to the story and yeah just keeping it up in the local newspapers in the area i 'd like to thank the mayor and the councillors here for allowing this message to be recorded in this hall of the people and all i ask of you today is to in principle to endorse the hagley ferrymed community board 's letter to new zealand post and the appropriate minister as a large dutch plea to reconsider the decision and it will be a sad day for walston and for the east of christchurch if and when this pro shop is closed thank you thanks very much joe and um you know it 's great to see individual community board members standing up for the opportunity i understand you couldn 't be here on the day that the petition 's coming from the community board is that right i 've the new the process i received was that because the community boards receives the petition um that it 's not going to be presented here but yeah but the community board i think will mention it in their report when they report but you weren 't available to come on that day so okay we really appreciate your passion and i actually hadn 't appreciated that you were the one who 'd sort of sat on the street for a couple of days and collected all those signatures so well done thank you okay thank you very much no it 's just we 've just dealt with this by way of um public you know the the five-minute presentation because it 's not the petition went to the community board i understand that but the request was for council to endorse the board 's letter and i just wonder what the process is for that sorry the request was for the council to endorse the hasn 't reported to the council yet yeah i 've i 've found a process to make it work for um joe who couldn 't come on the day sorry the answer is when the board reports to the company that 's when we will deal with it then okay thank you _"

    "text": "funding signature but feast and who fights vested by tongue moved by term seconded by Becky yes please first off I 'd really like to think the staff and appreciate the commitment in the work that they did on the matrix and leading into this especially our chilies feeling unwell so thank you very much I 'd also like to acknowledge and it think all the event organizers with the baby groups individuals professionals or volunteers making the application no matter what we do we don 't have enough funding to support everything I think through every two dollars apply for we have around about one dollar if we 're lucky so it has been a very hard process for staff and ourselves if you 'll remember back we together as the council and we we throw a workshop with Richard a nurse team following that that come to the events and festivals working group with the information supplied and I do sit our urge that if you 've got any questions both on the matrix that were supplied that this information is supplied to our staff for this purpose any questions and apart from that I think I 'll shut up and ruler candidates and stuff and thank you again guys thank you very much essentially a first and foremost source want to make a point that we we do actually need a resolution today we have events that are starting next week they 're reliant on on the result of today but also a lot to introduce you to Sarah Amazonia and kareena funny on my right who 've been part of this process as a result has already alluded the recommendations we 're a result of the workshop and sealant of July and men also part of the report so since she our recommendations obviously to consider the information that 's in front of you currently and am for approval for the report to go forward Thank wishes to people yes Jame them yeah thank you the first one regarding to the 2015 chinese festival you Xena I remember the last year a jury comes up when the Phantom for ten thousand dollars per wide and not pulling here while the miss out so this correct it main purpose because that was the event and go here no no no last year week when the Phantom for new last a year yes they we allocated funding last year yeah the event and go ahead so we withdrew the funding yes oh there 's my concern hostile regime they are this year we reach all parts of Asia near so we 're not making a contribution this year we 're not we 're not putting money unless years way I read it yes bring what 's the vision near we had an ankle injury the reason is that the official was actually what they 're proposing this year is four months long the event that we proposed to support last year was in the lead-up to the chinese new year and we had worked alongside the organizers to propose a two week celebration a long term around the chinese new year they 've now changed their minds they 're now going into a new direction it 's a very long festival for essentially what they 've already what they 've allocated within their budget and we see that festival for next year to ensure that goes ahead so we would like to pair they put it if it 's purely on the lantern festival going forward second questions that are regarding to the london festival because the purest are several years we are all aware they organized by the asian foundation then council our sponsors we went offending 475 the kind of thousand dollars SH Appa they also engage with some other sponsors and also asian foundation but this year this coming year in the council as the key unique organizers but we we rest a particle in here twenty-four thousand dollars I 'm concerned the candle of the quality no it 's kind of standard of the video how do we to keep the same standard quality to make the Lister the event a more attractive under the limited budget at twenty four thousand dollars whether the staff any strategy to engage with the wider dispensers so this year the events team for can I cancel events team have taken on board the organization of event we are engaging with a number of sponsors we have remember crotchet city council as to ensure that the event goes ahead early next year we hit a gap year last year it 's a resounding event it 's a popular event for the population we want to ensure that it becomes a part of that the fabric of our events going forward our events that the events team present I 've always high quality we want to ensure that this event continues to be of higher quality we 're working closely with Asia New Zealand and we will see if to be another successful event so you 're saying you satisfied that the twenty four thousand dollars what leverage with other sponsors will be sufficient to put on a great event yes and we 've also allocated off some operational budget within it as well we 're going to make sure that we present this event at a higher quality and we have a strategy for this going forward it 's very popular so nice right yeah um can I just so these questions have been asked to three times so I mean if they 've been asked and you really good to have got their information prior to this meeting I realize it 's like but you know we 've worked through all of this so if we can just from work with the staff prior to these meetings that would be really good inside you right now yep Yanni I just wanted to check out what the Six Nations International was Falls event right okay um and um just I just don 't like things like the one say Carols by Candlelight is too much 35,000 people is that what about so they hold up that 's what they 'll support for in their application it 's held a nation square but how do you 35,000 people and modems group we have to go by what 's in the application we believe there may be similar numbers allocated to this event yeah I was just quite surprised by that um I mean yeah given that that 's the that 's a really obvious one that just can 't_''_438.83 can 't_''_439.34 be real what how do we how can we take comfort and the other other foods little bit has has been ongoing and has been quite a historic historical event we are working closely with them and we 'll be doing so going forward to ensure either the year event goes the heat successfully but also any assistance that we can provide them with the event ultimately it 's not our event we have to ensure that we produced top-quality advancing in Christchurch and will do everything that we can to make sure that they have been successful okay and I was just wondering most the chair and the committee or someone could just explain um why the decision was made not to fund the brick show and also they cannot be canova national dog show which gets 40,000 people and I don 't know whether we are able to make amendments today but um just well we didn 't find it last year no see ya so just given up focus on trying to matter the central city in the city a child friendly advice the lego list of all I thought this quite a successful event and also the dog show which is a national event on those on the brick show we we fund it through this the seed funding actually we hit some funding lift over and allocated from the Vincent feast was fun last year and been through the working events and festivals working group we provided the brick show 15,000 part of the discussion was that if they produce always successful in delivering the event that they would not come back to us for funding and we wouldn 't continue to fund that one and at least they had something specific they wanted a target to bring within the event egm mosaic or a large Lego piece i went to the event on the first day very successful they moved into the new venue very successfully plus or so i 'd say i haven 't got the final report yet but I 've decided the numbers increase from past years and the dog show we didn 't put four due to it not being unique to christchurch it would be one off so it 's not returning so there 's no inspect for development in it and we believed to have a to the other events that were available all right so i will put the motion all those in favor say aye as opposed they know carried thank you very much and we 're gonna thank you for your help _"
