    "text": "my name 's noela gregory i 'm 59 years old and i was born and raised in the city of greater georgia my name is jenny gregory i 'm nola 's big sister i 'm 64 years old today we 're going to tell you our nana 's story her name is mini ring and very sad story but it 's um for us it 's got a happy ending so nana was born up in the east kimberley in turkey creek stewart creek station area frog hollow she lived her life up there until she was we think three years about three to four years three to four years old and um that 's when she was taken away along with um two of her siblings yes although they um they were born in a cultural setting in in the east kimberley they she would have been well she was known as a gidget child from mungle bungles around that area turkey creek beautiful country they were removed from there went by horse and cart for three months up to wyndham and put on a ship the ss collier 11 to 12 days to get to perth so they separated from their country brought down to perth and put into the um swan native mission or orphanage at the time that was run by um a church order anglican church order yeah so yeah mind you that um ship boat that that was put on was a cattle steamer so it wouldn 't have been a nice environment for them and they were only like three years old six years old and seven years old um the three of them and so from some of the stories that we 've read they were practically in rags when they were picked up so it would have been probably we 're thinking more cultural that would have been culturally appropriately dressed but for their journey down south they gave them blankets and stuff to keep them warm um they were collected in fremantle by the matron of the swan native and half cast mission and they were taken there they lived all of their lives all of their young lives on the swan native and half class mission so from the years old they knew a mother 's love father 's name after that it was just raised in a in a mission environment so when they went to that mission they were indentured as they call it so they went to school and lived in dormitory style accommodation uncle owen who was her brother lived in the boys dormitory they were indentured out to work so nana was known as a service girl so she went out and did domestic duties in people 's houses in perth but people look at a florida maid so that 's what she did and uncle owen was working in the on farms and different places like that so at the time that this happened as i said before it was under the 1905 act so that act was very active around that time and actually controlled everything that these children did we 've got files on nana and uncle owen which which are quite sad to read because every element of their life was recorded from a perspective of someone who didn 't really know them and comments made about where they come for being removed because their father was a white station owner um so there was um under that act [Music] sort of trying to assimilate these children and grow them up as as white children and nana made her journey from when they were 16 i think she was 16 owen came to dongle to live and gained work in the area and then went on to get married to a lady from dondre and nana came up and stayed with them for a while then eventually settled in german at one of the reserves here the camps um hospital hill which is beyond the old hospital bluff point video store where that is or was that 's where there was a camp and um so they were quite mobile moving around on the outskirts of town um but yeah so she had all her children here at the age of 52 she fell ill and was taken by the welfare to perth and buried in a porpoise grave when she passed away about six months later so no one from this family even though she had eight children did her funeral yeah that 's where the story is picked up by our cousin hazel um kelly who we just recently lost and she she searched for years and years to find nana i i actually went and found her too at the cemetery i was really sad when i found that it was in an area where they were redoing all the graves and she had three another two or three people buried on top of her so hazel hk as we called her was in the process of arranging for nana to be repatriated and brought back to geraldton here unfortunately on her on a trip up to visit the family that we just reconnected with in turkey creek she lost her life but we decided to bury nana with her in in the grave so finally we were able to bring our nana back home here to her adopted country sadly we weren 't able to take her back up to her own country but a lovely lovely thing that happened is we 've reconnected with a lot of her family from turkey creek and found out they were able to attend the funeral service and [Music] they did want to dance but unfortunately someone passed away up in there up in turkey creek so they weren 't allowed to actually something that was really beautiful that happened the guy that arranged a funeral for us arranged for us we all waited on the side of the highway where the old reserve used to be in allen rangeway there and he was he was waiting for the guy to bring nana 's body or bones back from perth and all of her grandchildren great-grandchildren everybody waited on the side of that highway until about nine o 'clock at night um just to wave her past and to welcome her back home he often near comments about you know like stolen generation and saying that was back there but we 're a testament today that it still has an impact and we 're in 2020 and she was removed in 1905 so all that time we were looking for her we finally reconnected so it was a long journey um native welfare files government documents that 's the they changed her name that changed her identity but resilience sean through and hk who we call hazel hk have passed away rest in peace she went on that journey for many years looking for nana looking for her people and trying to find out that information and she died doing it and and she was such a such a strong lady like a man and we we salute her for that for finding that out thank you for listening to our story about our nana and hopefully um you 'll be able to learn a little bit about the stolen generation and and how it um actually impacts on people i 'm fourth generation jenny 's fourth generation and it still impacts on us to this very day so thank you for listening we are kid kids girls thank you _"

    "text": "hi everyone i 'm kath public health nutritionist working at food bank wa in geraldton and today we 'll be doing some demo cooking from our delicious cookbook from our food sensation for adult recipe books we 're going to be making the choc amaze balls and my name is peter from the city of greater geraldton uh just a reminder we 're on cggtv and again i have the privilege of helping kath with some dessert today karth how are you going yeah good yourself very well thank you thanks for having us great opportunity absolute pleasure thank you so today we 're going to be making the choc amaze balls i haven 't done a dessert yet here so we will need some dates and i have soaked them because it takes about five minutes to soften them with hot water so i have my dates here that have been soften up and i will put them in here in my bowl healthy dessert healthy dessert um i 'm using wheat biscuits in there as well that you can crunch up so dates are great they have natural biscuits really crunchy and um heaps of dietary fiber now if we look at our recipe we 've put our um we 've put our biscuits we 've put out dates we need a bit of peanut butter so people with uh peanut butter allergy you can always replace this with a little bit of margarine just to have a bit of a fat content in there and then the other thing we will need is a little bit of coconut yeah so we need about three tablespoon of coconut and then we will have the rest to roll our little amaze balls in awesome i 'm actually looking at the ingredients now and something is telling me that something 's wrong because i don 't see any sugar there okay yeah no exactly we 're not cooking with sugar the sugar comes from the diets okay a little bit of honey but to be honest really rarely i will when i make them at my house i really rarely put the honey because i find that there 's plenty of taste with the dates so but to follow the honey so we need about one tablespoon of honey and then once i have my tablespoon i 'll just go like this because that 's about one tablespoon so we would purposely avoid using sugar in a lot of the recipes well we tend to try to decrease our amount of sugar as much as we can because added sugar is not only damageable for our teeth but it can lead to chronic diseases as well so we want to um you know prevent some diseases sure by maybe cutting back under added sugar so for example one of the main intake of added sugar in australia is soft drinks about 50 of our added sugar intake comes from soft drink when we run our food sensations session two is on label reading and on drinks and there 's a little have a guest game so we 'll do a have a guess with you today peter how many teaspoon of sugar do you think i would find in 600 ml bottle of soft drinks that 's a tricky one um i 'm gonna in my head overestimate i would a little bit more uh eight i would like a little bit more please really ten a little bit more come on no seriously come on how many 16. you 're kidding me 16. and so my goodness the world health organization recommend about six to 12 teaspoon of added sugar a day i like to say six so if you think that a bottle has 16 teaspoon of sugar you 've already blown the budget you know and that 's not counting the rest of your day that might have a little bit of i don 't know sugary cereals in the morning a piece of cake at morning tea coffee with sugar or something like that so yeah i 'm absolutely [Laughter] so see you need to come and join our food sensation for adults peter and then you can learn all these um yeah well i 've actually these informations yeah absolutely and i 'm actually looking at the moment at the food sensations for adults can we have a quick a quick chat about of course of course so i was looking at these um these quick read through yep and i have to say that it 's not just a recipe book is it no it has good content of what we run through decisions so session one we normally talk about australian guide to healthy eating what is healthy eating what it means how many serves of veggies and fruit and what a service then we cover in session two the label reading and we have label reading cards in our books our sugar and drinks so that 's lucky that you didn 't see the answer before i asked you in there yeah we are also in session three covering budgeting and meal planning fantastic so it covers a lot we also cover food safety tips um and uh you know like washing your hands that 's why now i can touch my food without any problem because i know i 've washed my hands um we talk about you know when you refresh refrigerate sorry that 's a big word um your food trying to make sure that you keep it um below the four degrees and and so on and food session this is a free program funded by the department of health and also evaluated by curtin university so we have good evidence that the program works and yeah trying to increase those veggies and fruit in the population so good advice for all of us to take and so how are these food sensations actually delivered so we do them face to face and normal time at the moment we are doing them online a three to four weeks program online on zoo unfortunately we can 't_''_411.84 do the cooking compound but please feel free to come on the cggtv facebook page because we have done a couple of recipes already we 've done the dip and we 've done flat bread this week we 're doing the san chow wow um so yes there 's a lot of different activities we also have facebook pages at food bank called quarantine cuisine oh yeah where we have tips we have recipes so basically at the moment running online but normally face to face people get all the recipe books they also get applied and they also get meal planners can inquire at food bank they can go on our website they can go on the www.superhero foods hq dot org dot a u and um have a look uh to book in any programs and uh to look at our recipe books and also our resources yeah and i think that sort of excuse me i think that sort of element is really really useful and and i guess at this stage i 'd really like to kind of um mention food bank and all the unsung heroes that we don 't get to see and all the wonderful work that you guys do behind the behind the scenes cat yeah i want to thank all the volunteers especially it 's volunteer week coming so um thanking all the volunteers because definitely without them food bank wouldn 't be what it is and i think you know it 's really important if people have a bit of spare time or money or food definitely donation is always appreciated absolutely and making sure that you know you you can come in have a chat uh inquire about the food sensation bowls my hands are a bit dirty so we had wheat biscuit two-wheat biscuit we had half a cup of dates soaked in hot water for about five minutes we had three tablespoon of coconut added to that if you don 't like coconut you could add some almonds or some crushed walnuts to that we had honey we had a bit of cinnamon a bit of peanut butter all mixed together then you roll and you um put final touch coconut around it 's a bit like a bliss bowl and we call it our choco maze bowls really yummy really tasty no added sugar they 're great to make and bring to a barbecue last minute visitors they don 't take long to make so give it a shot yeah it 's a good way to increase your fruit intake as well absolutely fantastic no added sugar before you go and pick up that 600 ml of soft drink have a think about the 16 teaspoons of sugar have some water yes always the best drink yes on this snow thank you for having me at see ggtv big thank you from me and our team in perth to everyone for listening today yeah and we 'll see you next time thank you thank you kathy it 's been

amen please regain your seats it is my distinct pleasure to introduce and to welcome to the deus commander greg swindon royal australian navy who will offer this evening 's keynote address distinguished guests ladies and gentlemen welcome to the 79th anniversary of the loss of the light cruiser hmas sydney i 'm commander greg swinden and due to covert 19 restrictions this is a pre-recorded speech i 'm sorry i cannot be with you today at geraldton at the world famous hmo sydney memorial 79 years ago today sydney was returning to fremantle having escorted the troop ship zealandia to sunder strait where a british cruiser took over escort duties zlandia was carrying reinforcements for the ill-fated australian 8th division of the second aif on their way to singapore and malaya which only a few weeks later became a battlefield after japan entered the war the afternoon of 19 november 1941 sydney was about 220 kilometers off the western australian coast pretty much due west of dirk hartog island when she sighted a suspicious fact the heavily armed german raider cormorant a lot has been written about cormoran claiming she was lightly armed and manned by the dregs of the german navy nothing could be further from the truth the german raider was heavily armed her guns were 5.9 inch sydney 's guns were six-inch guns corman was also fitted with 37 millimeter anti-tank guns and heavy machine guns and she was manned by some of the best officers and sailors of the german navy raider crews were hand-picked they were physically and mentally tough they had to be they spent months at sea off not often not stepping ashore from the time they left germany until they returned if they returned at all they trained daily and could operate their weapons with deadly efficiency corman 's commanding officer was third or detmins he was a skillful and capable officer prior to 19 november corman had sunk 10 allied merchant ships and captured one which was used to take merchant navy prisoners of war back to germany but raiders tried to avoid allied warships as the crew knew that their thin hole plating was to stop or slow down seabourn trade cutting what the navy calls the sea lines of communication and making it harder to move cargoes of wool wheat beef iron ore and oil as well as the troops and equipment needed to fight the war and to help corman with his task she had on board several hundred c mines and detmers was planning to lay some of these in western australian coastal shipping lanes near shark bay but this had to be done at night to avoid detection so on the 19th detmers was hoping to avoid a fight the royal australian navy 's job is to fight and win at sea this is as true now as it was in 1941 but the enemy always has a say in the matter and in 1941 sydney came up against a well-trained and highly capable enemy who if cornered were prepared to sell their lives dearly sydney was the glamour ship of the royal australian navy during 1940 she had served in the mediterranean under captain john collins who later went on to be our chief of navy in 1948. sydney italian destroyer espero and the italian cruiser bartolomeo coleoni as well as several enemy merchant ships by the time sydney returned home to australia in february 1941 she too was battle hardened over the next few months the cruiser took on convoy escort duties in the pacific and about 50 percent of her crew changed out which was fairly standard as many of those who had served in the mediterranean had been on board the ship for two or three years in may 1941 sydney also got a new captain joseph burnett who had spent much of the war so far in navy office in melbourne sydney began operating in western australian waters in the latter part of 1941 and it was strongly suspected the german raiders were active in these waters on several occasions when suspicious vessels were sighted burnett would take the ship to action stations and approach bow on that is with his two forward turrets ready for action and with the ship presenting the smallest possible target to a potential enemy this happened on at least two occasions in september 1941 sydney found a large floating to have come from a german raider the australian public however knew nothing of these events but it was common knowledge amongst sydney 's crew that german raiders were active in the indian ocean german raiders have been active in australian waters in new zealand before in 1940 and also laid several minefields which had sunk at least three ships again this information was not general knowledge to the avengers australia on the afternoon of the 19th at about 4 pm sydney spotted the disguised raider which was claiming to be the dutch freighter strat maluka and she approached bow on signalling the ship to identify herself detmer sent his ship to action stations with her gun crews closed up behind steel drop down flaps ready to open fire if required at the same time detmers turned cormoran away from the approaching warship and sent out the morse code signal qq which was standard for merchant ships being approached by a suspicious vessel detmos was hoping to convince the australian warship he was a friendly merchant ship and be allowed to continue on his way sydney continued to approach and and hoist the strap malacca 's international call sign slowly and awkwardly sydney approached closer and for reasons unknown closed within a kilometer of the disguised raider and was soon steaming parallel to the german ship sydney 's guns were manned and a four six-inch gun turrets rained at the suspicious ship burnett then ordered strat maluka to hoist her secret call sign ditmas of course did not know what this was and knew that all his attempts to avoid action had failed he then gave the order to hoist the german war flag and opened fire with guns and torpedoes his well-trained crew did this all within 15 seconds sydney also opened fire but her first salvo went high corman 's gunners scored devastating hits on sydney 's bridge and gunnery control they scored further critical hits to sydney 's forward turrets while sydney was trying to recover from the initial blows sydney 's two aft turrets x and y turrets soon resumed firing and local control with x turret causing serious damage to corman 's engine room and setting the radar on fire sydney was then hit forward number of torpedoes but only two got away within five minutes both ships had been mortally damaged all four of sydney 's turrets had been knocked out but cormoran 's guns remained in action detmers wanted to sink sydney so he kept firing until sydney steamed out of range about an hour later on board sydney we can only imagine the carnage and damage the cruiser was down by the bow as the ship was flooded forward by the torpedo strike she was also on fire from her forward funnel to the bow and had several shell holes close to the water line so there was flooding in other compartments her bridge was knocked out but she was still underway so her engine room was still functioning and she was making a deliberate course to the south east in order to close the australian coast so her command structure was still functioning despite her commanding officer and many other senior personnel having been killed but as the weather deteriorated the increasing swell caused the damage cruiser to roll violently from side to side and it is believed that around midnight she sank quickly onboard cormoran her engine room fire was out of control and the ship was unable to move over the next few hours the fire and ball corman raged and became completely out of control with over 400 sea mines on board detmer 's made the decision to abandon ship and this was done in a relatively orderly fashion with the ship 's lifeboats launched this was no mean feat with the ship on fire at night and with the weather beginning to deteriorate but as i said before the germans were well trained capable and highly disciplined several german sailors on board cormoran recall that around midnight as they were still trying to save their ship they could see the glow of the fire from the burning australian ship to the south but then suddenly it disappeared cormorant was abandoned and soon after the raging fires on board reached the sea mind stowage compartment causing several mines to explode when the wreck of cormoran was eventually located in 2008 it showed that the ship had been literally blown apart by these explosions by the early hours of of the ocean and their wrecks were not found until 2008 some ill-informed commentators have called this action australia 's greatest naval disaster certainly the loss of all 645 men on board sydney was a tragedy but the battle was not a disaster a disaster would have occurred if cormorant had not been sunk a disaster would have been if corman had laid her minds in australian waters a disaster would have been if corman 's mind had sunk an australian troop ship on its way to singapore or the middle east where the australian 6th 7th and 9th divisions were serving a disaster would have been if corman had continued to sink allied merchant ships in the indian ocean and cut our sea lines of communication and stopped our seabourn trade then and now the lifeblood of our economy the sinking of corman was in fact a victory but a very bitter victory indeed despite sydney 's ship 's company consisting of being over half new personnel untried in battle they had fought and destroyed a very dangerous enemy warship operating off our west coast they then tried to not to be such is the price that regrettably sometimes needs to be paid to protect democracy against dictatorship and tyranny and the loss of sydney continues to remind us today that the price of liberty is eternal vigilance the loss of sydney touched all australians in 1941 the sheer size of the loss 645 men in one action were sadly reminiscent of the world war one fighting at gallipoli and on the western front where hundreds of men were killed in a single day australian casualties on this scale in such a short space of time were fortunately rare during world war ii the nearest being in the battle of el alamein in north africa in late 1942 where 620 australians were killed and over 2 000 wounded or taken prisoner during a two-week period i was fortunate some years ago to meet two men who had served in sydney during her destruction of the italian cruiser bartolomeo colonio in 1940 they were able seaman tom fisher and john ravenscroft both young men from perth tom served in a turret up forward in the ship as a loader and back of the ship as the communications operator each of sydney 's four turrets had a crew of 20 men both tom and john left the ship in late october 1941 they lived to old age and many times said me why was i spared was it divine intervention or just pure luck we will never know as you walk about the memorial today and look at the dome of souls with 645 stainless steel seagulls spare a thought for the men of sydney who did not live to see old age many were only in their 20s and the youngest was only 17 years of age also remember the families of the crew of sydney that were left behind mothers fathers sisters brothers wives and children lives irreverently changed when sydney was lost i would also strongly recommend that you visit the geraldton war cemetery and pay your respects to the grave of the unknown sydney sailor his body was washed up a christmas island in a life raft in february 1942 and buried there in 2006 his remains were located and he was later interred at the war between the two ships in 1941 he has found his safe harbor but his 645 shipmates are still with sydney and still patrolling the waters of this great nation 's history sincere thanks sir for what has been a listening pleasure a thought provocation and indeed a wonderful testament to our purpose this evening in honoring the 645 souls of the sydney two and their families our guest speaker this evening is from a far less remote time than 1941 yet in his tasks his daily orders his routines and his customs and traditions are the fundamentals of shipboard life that have stood through time and been tested under fire by thousands of seamen and naval officers since march of 1901 when australia formed her navy let me proudly introduce and welcome the commanding officer of hmas 75 commander edward seymour official guests government representatives association members current and former serving members and most importantly hmos sydney two families i 'm commander edward seymour current commanding officer of hms sydney five the fifth iteration of the famous hmo sydney name thank you for the opportunity to speak to you today like to respectfully acknowledge the yamaji peoples who are the traditional owners and the first people on the land in which the geraldton memorial is built the nanagati the willingnew i would like to pay my respects to the elders past present and emerging for they hold the memories the traditions the culture and the hopes of the yamachi peoples this online ceremony is being held today to remember 645 australians of the royal australian navy and the royal australian air force australians who served in one of our nation 's most famous warships hmo sydney ii we also recall that it was their duty in times of war to take life and as such we remember the 82 germans who also died in the battle with hmas sydney 2. hmas sydney 2 was an awe-inspiring team of sailors and airmen from all backgrounds who bonded together to create one of the most effective fighting units this nation has ever produced their deployment to the mediterranean in the early stages of world war ii is considered by naval historian vice admiral peter jones to be the single most successful deployment hmas sydney ii performed a freedom of entry parade into the city and a holiday was declared for all the school students so that they could witness the event the city of sydney gifted the ship some bronze plates commemorating this deployment and in particular hmas sydney 's victory over the bud tolemo caleoni at the battle of cape sparta these are known as the sparta plates unfortunately the originals were lost to the ship in 1941 but those who are associated with sydney 2 will be pleased to know that replicas have been made and are permanently displayed in the conference room of our nation 's newest warship hmo sydney 5. a permanent reminder of the gallantry and sacrifice of the 645 australians lost with hmas sydney 2 in 1941. even in spite of her loss with all hands in 1941 a horrible year for australia hms sydney 2 never failed to achieve her assigned mission a legacy that all hmas sydney 's which have come after her have carried on the loss of sydney too while protecting our shipping off the west coast near geraldton was truly a are still feeling the consequences of this action 79 years later part of remembering the sacrifice of sydney too is in recognising that there are always people left behind people who are affected by the sacrifices made by our sailors people who will always be part of the wider sydney family the families of our sailors are the strongest most resilient people it is them who make it possible for their loved ones to serve our nation not only is this memorial service held to remember the sacrifice of those who never returned it is for the relatives and descendants of those men capability in the royal australian navy is made by people well-trained dedicated loyal people not large chunks of steel the history of the rn has proven this point over and again but for every one of those people there is a family that is willing to let their sailor go to sea willing to carry on without them for long periods so they can serve our nation they are willing to risk waving goodbye with the chance of never seeing their loved one again and in the to make the ultimate sacrifice and to do their duty for australia but 645 families were as well navy families are still willing to make this sacrifice sydney five is newly commissioned and ready to serve our nation for us there will only be 220 families who will send their sailors to sea far less than the 645 families of hmas sydney ii but nonetheless the same willingness to serve to endure long periods of separation to carry on regardless it still exists the connection between the ships continues and will continue into the future as a crew the men and women of sydney 5 have studied the story and the legacy of hmas sydney 2. only a few months ago i learned that a member of our current crew is a relative of one of the 645 men lost in hmi sydney 2. the tyres continue through the generations to today we as a crew know the history of the loss of hmas sydney ii in battle with the cormorant we know the pain suffered by the families of the sailors who were missing for so many years until sydney too conducted the single most successful deployment in the history of the ran sinking the botulimo caleoni the esboro and the cormorant we know that the sailors in sydney died fighting for the future a better future a free australia we don 't know is what they would have thought of their legacy and the future that they helped to create here 's what i think they would have thought they would be proud that the name of their ship was continued as promised by wartime prime minister curtin when he famously said there will always be a sydney they will be proud of sydney three in the korean war the malayan confrontation and the vietnam war they would be proud of sydney iv in the gulf war east timor international coalition against terrorism and the iraq war they would be proud that thanks to their successors and the legacy they built the name sydney has been represented in more conflicts in the 20th century than any other ship name they would be proud that sydney five would be built in australia the first sydney to have been they new sydney is the equal most capable warship ever produced and operated by this nation they would be proud that their families continued on after they departed to carry out their duty and that their family members and descendants are watching today 79 years later remembering their sacrifice so while we gather here to mourn the loss of a ship which never failed to achieve her mission we acknowledge that mission success sometimes requires sacrifice and let us also be thankful for what they did for us for their contribution in creating a better future we will remember them lest we forget we take on a little more formality now and you 're invited to stand for the next element of our service to recite the naval owed as the commanding officer of the training ship morrow commander anc spike jones and following the ode our bugler from the gelatin city band mr craig bassett will lament the last post we

your behalf to welcome to the deus the warden of and gentlemen it is indeed an honor and a pleasure to have this opportunity to address you on an occasion as significant as this the sydney memorial was the idea of a small group of rotarians who as retareants do search for a project will be of benefit to the community while at the same time have a lasting effect in 1998 the rotary club of geraldton in response to long-standing community interests embarked on an ambitious journey to build a memorial on mount scott in geraldton dedicated to the 645 men lost at sea when the hmas sydney two were sunk off the west australian coast during world war ii the hmia sydney two memorial is by far the largest and proudest project the rotary club of geraldton has ever undertaken the initial rotary design was basic and military in nature through a stroke of good fortune the smith sculptures were contacted to design the casting of a statue they were able to provide their expertise and knowledge of the sydney two story and as a result designed a memorial which told the story of the sydney 's true long term that the memorial to sydney to will be well received locally nationally and beyond designed to world-class standards to tell the story of the sydney two and to memorialize the 645 lost souls with their ship in a unique and meaningful manner in 1999 smith sculptures charles and joan were commissioned to create a concept and design aspects of the memorial engineer john colley of fondx constructions was to provide engineering details for the main or initial four components of the memorial which comprised symbolic elements expressing the tragic loss of sydney too the smith sculptures presented an artist 's impression of their concept of the proposed memorial to the board of the rotary club of geraldton at the home of the president of the day the late jim patterson all present unanimously resolved to accept and develop the concept as a project reasons recently lieutenant commander desmond woods ran wrote the hmas sydney two memorial in geraldton wa became a pro glacial pilgrimage for 65 000 visitors each year some 20 000 arrive by sea on cruise ships that come to geraldton specifically to allow passengers to of the memorial as an outstanding example of commemorative art it was designed by sculptors charlie and joan smith and opened by the then governor of wa lieutenant general john sanders ac on the 19th of november 2001 that was on the 60th anniversary of the loss of the ran cruiser in battle with the german raider cormorant off the coast of wa in 1941. the annual commemoration each november has become a major occasion in the life of geraldton and attracts relatives of sydney sailors among many others from far and wide who wish to pay their respects to the 645 members of the ship 's company who died with sydney too until april 2020 the flags flown at the memorial permanently did not include the australian white ensign the chief of navies was requested by the warden of the memorial saddam ralston for permission to for this to be changed and the awe to fly there with the australian national flag the state flag of wa and the flag of the city of greater geraldton the chief of navy gave us permission for the awe to fly permanently by geraldine 's navy cadets unit dias morrow in line with naval traditions flying of the awe an order approved by the chief of the navy ensures that the protocols of the royal australian navy and the australian defense force are upheld quote unquote commissioned by the chief of navy vice admiral mike nornen ao to permanently fire the awe at the hmas sydney two memorial in charlton greatly enhances the status and relevance of this outstanding memorial as one who has been associated with this memorial for over two decades and its initial and current warden to see the awe permanently flying pays the highest respects to the 645 men lost who are now at rest with this ship the hmas sydney two memorial in geraldton was designed to memorialize those lost and is recognized as one of the most outstanding in its class it converts its message and focus to all who visit both personally and through various websites throughout the world the memorial is an absolute credit to the proponents of the memorial the rocky club of geraldton and the creators and designer smith sculptures hence flying this memorial of national significance formally declared so by the prime minister of australia sydney one master on the northern shore of sydney harbour and the sydney two memorial charlton are two of the few places outside an ra insurance establishment where the awe can be permanently flown by the chief of navy 's permission on land there will be a major commemorative event at the memorial on the 19th of november 2021 next year on the 80th anniversary of the loss of hmas 72 in closing it has been a pleasure and an honor to address you briefly on this occasion and i wish you all well in both health and happiness and i look forward to being with you on future occasions thank you [Music] in the indian ocean 's watery wastes twas the year of 41 [Music] two vessels fought a battle

    "text": "my folks coming back to you again from the Queens Park theater and on CJD TV once again and I would like to introduce now to you Kathy councillor and Kathy is going to tell a bit of her story but before she does and Kathy tell us a bit about yourself Oh depends on what you wanna know know what do you wanna know what tell us a bit about your the nagas job people that work at your panel I 'm still Lyman Yama G Nuggets a woman from this region but I 'm still trying to currently find my way with my people not what I mean in that way I mean as in the history of my family we we were me and my brother and sister were taken away from home so unfortunately we didn 't have the luck of growing up with family I 've managed to get quite a few member family members in but it 's just that 's this sort of this generation but as in the old people are the ones that I 'm still learning about which is it still alive until happened to bump into him one day but and from there that 's when I was determined I need to find my place in life with negative people here in Jordan and this year 's theme for reconciliation is in these together what does that mean to you that same it 's a pretty powerful thing considering in this day and age we have a lot of foreign people coming into our country and teaching trying to teach them our ways our culture our history to be a part of us and showing them that you know we 've been here for 60,000 years and you know it 's time for them to come and be a part of us as well and what about the younger generation how do you feel where do they connect into that seemed to be a part of us is that what it is yeah in this together in this together the the younger generation is totally different now it 's there 's a lot of work that needs to be done with today 's generation somewhere it 's gone off until now we can try our hardest to to make them recognize and be a part of our history what actually happened and it 's not all about racism because in today 's generation it 's all you know oh it 's because I 'm black I mean there is some in some cases there may be that but the younger ones we need to seriously work on our younger ones in this day and age and show them that there 's there 's more to life than the drugs and the alcohol and whatever has been handed out to them now that 's my leg of it yeah so tell us a little bit about where you did your schooling and and you said you were taken away from your family when you 're Ryan this would have been in the 1970s yeah so this this was still happening folks in the 1970s we were very young and we were taken away from our mum the one thing we could never understand is why would we take and we had a house we had our car our dad had I mean almost very very young but I can still see my mum on the veranda crying because she knew she was never gonna see their children again we were gone for quite some time and it wasn 't until and the sad thing about it is it ruined my parents marriage mum and dad both went their own ways but dad always stayed here in Jordan because he knew one day that his kids were going to come home and we were quite lucky that I managed to track our skids down and and find us and bring us back but we 're in saying that it coming after coming out of the mission I suppressed that so far back in the back of my mind that life didn 't even exist him anymore it just wasn 't even a part of my life and to be honest with you it wasn 't_''_292.379 until the 2008 when the Rudd Government did the National apology I took my children to watch the rabbit-proof fence at the cinemas and at the beginning of the movie when the white man came in and I thought jeez this is so real you know and I started crying and my daughter said mum what are you crying for but I didn 't know what I was crying for I honestly didn 't anyway so we went home and I had to ring my mum you know and I said mum you need to go and watch this rabbit fence movie because it 's just so real you know I said I don 't know I said I said then I just cried through this movie and everything that was going on in it it was real to me and she said Kathleen you were a part of that they took you from me and that 's when the floodgates started opening for me and the reality set in and and I didn 't expect my wife friends to say sorry to me you know it wasn 't there they 're doing my sister and I did go to welfare to ask why did you do this we couldn 't get an answer from them they whether they would all refused I don 't know it wasn 't_''_376.5 until the truth that when the Rudd Government did the apology and the mayor of children at the time asked me to do a speech and I mean of course I had their crime in what stolen generation kid doesn 't have a crime talking about them things very emotional it 's very very emotional and I was quite honored to sit right the mayor was sitting in front of me when I was doing my speech and to see the mayor actually crying that this is a kid from the 70s that was taken you know in the 70s when you look at it is is just there not far yeah it 's like around the corner and that I had some of the old auntie 's the elders sitting up the bag after I did my speech and you know they called me over and one of them Nana Yvonne Radcliffe said to me you know what we always wondered what happened to them three little councillor kids we never ever knew but she said now we know the story and I was 12 years the first time after we 'd been taken away and unfortunately my mum I love my mum I love her to death that 's my mum but welfare when we were take and they broke that bond yeah that bond was never ever repairable and I chose not to I mean I 've got a daughter of my own and I chose not to do that with her and the funny thing is is when I had my firstborn child thinking back I went was with my husband we went out to Laluna he was eight weeks old and people so mighty taken an eight-week-old baby Bush you know but at the back of my mind I was fearful that well who was going to come and take my child yes so if I will have wished be able coming back here and I mean I 've spoken to my children about it you know them and my daughter still asks me a lot of questions my son 's they know what happened to their mum but in in every family when when you have a son or a couple my sons have never ever pressed that with me and I think maybe because they might hurt as much as I hurt but I 'm starting to tear up now when I talk about these things it is a very emotional issue very much and and the thing is is this year we I got in contact with some of my high school friends we 're having a high school reunion at the end of the year for those of us that are turning 50 and some of them ask me a lot of questions like where were you we knew you were at school but you were never in any photos there 's probably from year 8 to 12 I had was in probably about six photos probably not even that actually and I then I had to explain to my friends what had happened and a lot of them living overseas some of them actually multimillionaires and I actually broke I broke my friends who you know who these high-ranking people in these high places and explain to them that when we came out of the mission that then I don 't know whether it was with every family but it was within our family particular that we had to be excluded from photos and after I had explained that to my friends and you know a lot of them kept saying you know we 're so sorry and I 'm not I don 't want you to apologize to me I want you to be my friend you know to learn from that yeah and a couple of my actually school teachers and they asked if they could use my story and I said yeah you 're more than welcome to and the funny thing is is one of my friends when she moved to Jordan with her family not long after her father was killed they came down from Newman and she said to me well she had no friends but I 'd befriended her she became my best friend and you 're going back 32 years and she 's still my best friend to this day after she read my stories she said to me Kathy I need to talk to you she said about Canal burn because that 's where we were on the other side of in the mission other side of canal burn now we went to school in Canal burn and she said she was when she went to school in Canal burn she never had friends but she became friends with a lot of the mission kids and we used to play a lot together in that artist call and this one particular day her mother if the mission bus had arrived to pick us up while she was playing with us and they tried to get her on the mission bus and she was kicking and screaming because she 's a white girl you know and they tried to get actually get here on the bus and her mother happened to pull up and you know argue this is my child you know and um so you know her mom took a photo of her daughter with all our submission kids and then when they came to Jordan that 's when I became friends with her again but I didn 't know her I knew her but I didn went around I had a coffee with her and her mom and we started talking about things and her mom says I have a photo that I need to show you and she said this one particular day they tried to get my daughter on the bus with you mission children she said until I argued with him and she said and this is the fight I happen to take of my daughter with all the mission children and who 's sitting up in this photo this little black girl and I thought to myself how ironic sighted you know we were friends in Canali this had happened to her where they try to take her and then all these years later may became best friends a nice community then from the other thing is that she would the mother of that child would know or have a bit of an understanding of what it 's like you have your child years taken from you knew she I mean she 's she 's she 's got a beautiful olive complexion and if you didn 't know who you would honestly but yeah it was just something like that could even happen it was unbelievable yeah so um the stories that Kathy 's talking about that there 's a lot of intergenerational trauma like Casey said her kids still it still affects her kids even though it wasn 't the children that it happened to it was their mom that had happened that 's what I 've original people talk about when they talk about into irrational trauma it 's passed down from one generation to the next folks I 'm fourth generation I didn 't go through that my grandmother and my great-grandmother did but I still feel it in my heart I feel my Nana 's story I feel my great-grandmother 's story because we can 't reconnect to what was what is lost all of the stories from my Nana sign are lost so this is why we are inviting you to come and learn about the Aboriginal culture learn from us hear our stories and like I said in previous videos don 't be afraid to go out to some of the aboriginal organizations ask them sit teach you about the aboriginal culture Kathy thank you very much for coming and sharing your story with us today I know it must have been very hard it 's it gets easier not easy easy but it does and I feel a lot better now that I could freely talk about it but and in saying all this before we go I had a friend of mine ring me up she 's doing some course through TAFE and plus she works and she are aiming me up and she said I 'm is there any chance that you can teach well if I do a video of you making a damper and I said you I personally yourself why can 't you make a damper but it was for her a boss and his wife and I saw well okay then we 'll come around tomorrow morning and you know ten o 'clock but I had previously made a damper before she had arrived and while she 's filming in that and she rang her boss and said I 'm doing it now wrong but the thing that annoyed know and I said to the boss while she had on the phone I said why couldn 't you just come to my house why couldn 't you come to my house and and I can teach you but you 're also making a new friend as well and I said to the young girl when she left I said well in future make them be a part of it instead of them sending you out to do the programs or projects and I haven 't heard from your sales but yes yes yeah that 's what we need to do there that inviting them into our space yes and teaching them about the average wage and and the thing is not even with our NAIDOC we get together every year one for one week every year and what annoys me is and it seriously does annoy me is is we as Aboriginal people are the first nation people of this country we can get out there and we 're playing our part by inviting everybody to come in and be a part of us but then when they have have them events we go to their events come to our events yes it 's the only way to learn yeah exactly it sounds on experience yeah so there you have it folks don 't be afraid to come and learn from us thank you for listening to us and thank you Cathy you 're willing to tell us your story thank you _"

    "text": "hi everyone I 'm captain attrition Asst at Food Bank working in Geraldton branch today I 'll be doing some cooking demo from our delicious recipe books and we will be cooking from our food sensation for adult number two recipe books did you know that food bank is the state 's largest food relief organization that provides 6 million meals per year to people in need and Joely in Jotun we rely strongly on rescued and donated product that would otherwise go to landfill food insecurity is growing at the moment and so we have less donation and more demand and we have therefore to rely on the nation to then purchase foods for those in need so today we 're going to be cooking our toasty our flatbread that we found in our food sensation recipe books and you can also find this online we will need only four ingredients to turn this into a great bread so did you know that with our food sensation program we now run it online for three weeks and we normally run that program over four weeks it 's a free and we also touch on food safety so today we 'll be needing our flour for our great flat flat e bread and we will also use yogurt instead of using butter or oil I 'll just put my apron on and we 'll get going so if you 're at home wanting to cook some flatbread get your flowers your yogurt your mixed hurts and your pepper ready okay so let 's grab our recipe book we need 1 cup of yogurt and we will need also some cups of flour 2 cups of self-raising flour so I 'm just going to add my two cups of self-raising flour yeah I like to put that in the sieve because I find it 's easier to work the flour with so let 's just do this little pot that was one cup and I have now 2 cups and all you have to do is to then grab your yogurt and as I said we use yogurt instead of the fat that you normally would find in your bread the yogurt has a lot of calcium has a lot of in you okay so I 'll put my yogurt in I 'll leave it open because sometimes with that recipe we need a little bit more yogurt depending how the dough goes give it a good stir just wash my hands and I feel that when I make dough the best thing is to put my hands in there and finish by using my hands to make it all nice and when it start all getting together you can feel it it 's a great recipe to make with kids right away because the kids love that playing it 's a like doing play-doh that you can eat so make sure if you have kids in the kitchen yes it will get a bit messy but it 's gonna be a really fun activity for them especially if they 're at home or feeling a bit bored okay so I have my dough nearly ready what I 'll put in is a little bit of my mixed herb it 's just a bit sticky okay so I recommend you put the herbs in we need about one to two teaspoon little bit of pepper so I 'm putting herbes and pepper in this one but nothing stops you from maybe putting sultanas and cinnamon together for a little breakfast bread or a snack great snack for lunchboxes so school has started again and sometimes we just don 't know what to put in the lunchbox of kids so I find that these little flat breads are great and really easy to cook ok so once this is done I 'm gonna be ready to roll it so I 'm gonna have to just turn my toaster or my sandwich press sandwich press is a great way to cook I find it 's easy it 's really efficient because you can cook both sides all at once and iPhone you can cook French toast with it you can cook chicken breast you can cook salmon steak so it 's really a good tool to have in the kitchen so I 'm just gonna roll couple of flatbread here to show you what it looks like so this is a little flatbread that I have another one here that I can make we 'll put it a couple of minutes so I find this can be easily eaten with carry like a naan bread it can also be used as a pizza base and I find if you were to roll for example a bigger one and you were to roll it really flat you can then I 'll show you you can then put some maybe pizza sauce or you can put some cheese and grated carrots and then you can use it as a scroll and you would roll it nicely cut it and then put it in the oven so we have one of the recipes on website that shows crows that 's why and once again it 's another easy thing to cook with the kids so did you know that um this naan bread or similar to naan bread would not have much salt at all because I 've made it from scratch while the naan bread that I would find at the shop would be higher in sodium or salt I was there this morning actually looking at the different type of nan bread on the 200 milligrams but still over 120 milligrams of sodium in our session two of our food sensations for adults we talk about writing labels and we do encourage people to try to choose products that are lower than 120 milligrams of sodium per hundred grams so please come and join us in our food sensation if you want to know more about label reading so I have a great little toasty here that 'll add to my plate and see how these beautiful flatbread come up nicely toasted and that would be great as I said with a curry you could then serve it in a lunch box for kids as a little mini pizza or you could make Scrolls out of them okay so there 's that toasty flatbread from our food sensation recipe books food sensation is funded by the Department of Health and we try really hard to promote healthy eating reading labels meal planning through our food sensation for adults programs so please join us either online or when the time 's comes face-to-face so I hope that you will be able to use that little myself and the team at Food Bank stay well stay healthy stay connected thank you _"

    "text": "through covert everybody got gardening they were outside and inside but by far inside plants took off and so now you 've all got these beautiful inside plants and you need to know how to care about them so i 'll give you a few tips on a few little issues that can go wrong with them what you 're doing at home and hopefully they 'll you 'll have a great outcome and your plants will flourish [Music] [Applause] [Music] hello i 'm beth from clark street water gardens and gifts today i thought i 'd talk about your indoor plants and the things that can go wrong the first one is that you put it in a position inside which is nice and cozy and then during the night you put the heater on which puts the temperature up then in the day you turn the temperature off and it gets cold again so your plants going from eight degrees up to say 24 25 degrees they don 't like it so if you can keep the ambient temperature the same for your plants then they 'll get pesky little things you have in your house you 'll find them in your kitchen they buzz around little black bugs and they 're a nuisance now there 's two ways you can get rid of them you can spray them with neem oil sometimes that works but what nats do is they get into the soil they lay their eggs and then they hatch so you might get rid of the ones that are buzzing around but they 'll all hatch out of the soil so there 's two things you can do you can get some nil which is this and you put this around the top of your plant about that thick and it 's porous so it doesn 't um keep the wetness in your soil the nats can get out when they 've hatched but they can 't get back in to lay their eggs so that will stop them getting in and out of the soil you can also get a trap like this which has a bright yellow thing in it and all the little maps will stick to the yellow so you around that are in your room so that 's two things you can do for nats the next thing i thought i 'd talk about is when your plant starts to look a bit like this and you think you 've watered it you think oh the soil is wet what 's going on well this is because it 's become resistant to um the soils become water resistant so it 's going on the top it 's running through and no water is going actually into the roots so the way to fix this is you get a bucket of water you pop your plant in the water and you 'll see when you put it in here you 'll see all bubbles coming up this is another one i 'll just show you what i 'm talking about so you put it in the water and see all the bubbles that 's because the soils become water resistant the other thing you can do is once you 've done that is get a moisture meter and the moisture meter tells you whether your plants dry wet or just got your plant at home and it 's looking great but don 't forget plants need food too so what you can do is you can have a indoor plant fertilizer you can have a fruit tree fertilizer you can have a native fertilizer you can have an outdoor fertilizer or you could go with sabrina hans fertilizer which is done is made for everything it 's a slow release fertilizer you can put it on indoor outdoor natives fruit trees anything you want and it 'll do the job if you need advice with any of the plants that you have purchased whether they 're from here or not and you 're not sure just pop in and i 'll give you a hand if you want a stand or a pot and you just can 't find the right one and you get in and you think oh what size was it i 'm not sure i 'm happy for you to bring that plant in whether you bought it here or not to come and pick a pot we 're located at six clark street in geraldton you _"

    "text": "hello and welcome to qpt time I can 't seriously hold my hands like that I try and see like I was serious in Sevilla but I can 't do it I 'm Rosie and this is Lex and you may have seen us before in some of our other interviews and we are for the first time joining forces today to interview mr. new Cara mr. Thompson I don 't know how we 're gonna James thank you right to be here we 're really excited to talk to you because I think a lot of people you know I 've seen you around or they 've heard of you and I remember when I first came to town someone 's like oh you need to meet James Thompson like he 's really interesting and like he does that music festival and I was like well he must be such a celebrity and I 'm really excited to know the man behind that celebrity we only interview celebrities on that 's quite exclusive I call a celebrity and I probably should but you know you were when I first great guy you should meet and so you kind of have this myth about you but there 's so much more to you than just your car and the things that people know about you where where did you start your life born in Jalan cat country and grew up in a little coastal town called Point Lonsdale in Victoria the bottom Port Phillip Bay next to the ocean and the bay beautiful place but a bit long winter times not like here yeah yes so yeah I was born over there a long time ago now yeah and spent my first 20 odd years there mostly and a bit of time in Geelong and Melbourne yeah yeah well you all were you always an ocean kid like you grew up next to the ocean and now you 're in Charlton yeah but my parents families they were farming families yeah mom and dad 's parents mum 's parents were in the northeastern Victoria place called Alexandra had a sheep farm up there and dad 's mum and dad had farm on the bellerian Peninsula but his dad died when three older sisters and mother they ran a dairy farm in poor non-stop and I can remember as a little kid going on mum off grandma 's little gingka which is a horse and cart delivering you know the big cans of milk and stuff around the place yeah was there any was there ever any prospect that you would become a farmer no I don 't think so well the only prospect like dad was a house for him over move trains and planes automobiles everything yeah and also re-stamped houses and that and yeah I helped him out since I was a little kid and yeah I didn 't like doing that job it was real heavy arduous job sort of thing and yeah I want to be a cabinet maker or a builder Yeah right but I never you know got a apprenticeship when I was finishing school so yeah just yeah tried all sorts of things and ended up running my own gardening business in pommel style for a number of years how did you even like make that transition of time on the farm then 'm just thinking you know what I 'm gonna get into gardening yeah yeah I was unemployed quite a bit but also done a bit of work and helped out friends who are doing similar things and then they gave up their businesses and I just continued on and yeah love doing that job helping all these retired people out and rentals and stuff like that point on starcoins gross pretty small sort of community and great place to run a business like that but yeah I know I think I just enjoyed that sort of work working in gardens and outdoors and also I was a photographer as well just to be photographer and that allowed me to do that as well as a young person were you quite introverted or you know were you really kind of searching for this wider community of maybe arts or the things that were out there like what what were you like kind of great question um no I always loved being around people and stuff especially my close knit friends and stuff like that we 're always we 're very adventurous dunes and stuff and yeah Bush buggies we drove a bush buggy from a whim or 15 or 16 my friend Horry and myself he bought this junebug in geelong which is 30 k 's away and we drive it with no brakes all the way to point on style over two days I love testing limits and stuff and would you be under easy yeah yeah oh yeah yeah yeah we had to go on some roads there 's a railway line on old railway disused railway line down the billowing peninsula which we tried to go down most of it but we had to go down roads we had to go down a highway in in-between in the medium strip but you just got out of the suburbs and were cruising along and next thing we saw this police car palenik houses rule house and oh jumped out and walked away from it and wide from the go and then he went the other way luckily and we continued on [Laughter] [Laughter] yeah bit of a fun adventurous what where I grew up went on starcoins it 's bush areas and stuff like that and then there 's salt lakes where everyone used to take you know the 50 bombs and go and do Bowie 's around the Salt Lake 's and stuff like that and yeah and we rode bikes you know push bikes and Bush of BMXers and stuff like that yeah lots of diving and surfing and yeah yeah a beautiful place to grow I was so lucky debate man yeah so did you kind of have that awareness of your natural surroundings you know were you starting to get interested or aware about the environment around you or that just so kind of like a non-event no yeah no I really applaud where I lived there yeah I used to like we grew up across the road from like the what would you call it it 's like a reserve there 's big sort of coastal June full of bush and stuff like that and then there 's the bay sort of thing so it was my playground yeah and I hang out with a guy across the road it was P years older he 'd taught me how to ride a mini bike through the bushes and stuff and build cubbies and yeah smoked CDs and stuff like that in grade six smoking oh yeah I love primary school really love primary school yeah because primary school was just across the road as well and surrounded by that bush area and you know I would all go and play in the bushes and stuff and kiss chasey and stuff what about moving into high school okay for anything well yeah I had a choice of going to the local high school in Queens Kloof right next door or going to the tech school in Geelong which was about 40 minute bus ride I was y 'all knew a few people older than me that went to Tech and I thought yeah that 's what I want I like doing that building stuff and whatever so I end up going there but it was such a change from primary school East Tech was pretty rough sort of school and yeah got into trouble in new seventh yeah one of these older students he dope I wouldn 't give him one before school yeah so I had to go get the last got the lash a few times from the vice principal yeah yeah but you know though growing up things oricon and do you think like did that sort of put you in when you were yeah this kid getting in trouble when you yeah that 's quite young to be you know getting in trouble for that kind of stuff what you know did you sort of start to see yourself as this kind of rebel or a naughty kid or was it just like you had your life outside of that and it was just something that happened at school yeah it was pretty much what happened at school I think as most kids will like that there yeah there was a lot of orphan kids that attended that school and now yeah pretty rough sort of kids because I 'm really I 'm really interested in that how people you know think if we sort of you see a lot of chats in things like you know neighborhood watching that about kids are and I often want to know how the kids see themselves you know like there 's a kid ever see themselves is this like you seven getting in trouble for smoking ciggies and you know in there all I 'm I 'm now a naughty kid you know yeah yeah I often see those posts on neighborhood watch and stuff and I think I think back to when I was young and heaps other kids you know you you get caught and you 'd get a a good stern warning which I did I got caught making a cigarette lighter from coals in Jalan in year 7 yeah you know walked out the door it was a dare you know mouths bunch of kids we went in there and yeah walked out the door and the CICC installed security coming tapped me on the shoulder can you come up stairs please and didn 't_''_615.57 I got the policeman that come in and had to go the police station and mum had to come and pick me up and that policeman I ended up being a family friend because jeeps and trucks now like my parents did yeah there was times yeah I think when I think back I think yeah though pretty angry sort of thing there was a few things but then there was one incident I think I start a fire there 's a big block of units being built next door and I was in explore east always go explore and stuff and I found some matches in there and throw a match in a box in it yeah start to smolder sort of thing that 's when things got more serious and then mum and dad thought we 've got to do something with James you know we 're gonna yeah rainy means sort of thing and a family friend he was head of a save intro group and he suggested I join the group what 's the venture that 's like you have Cubs then you have Scouts yeah between certain years and then venturers is like 16 or 15 or to 18 or something like that yeah but with venturers you actually the the kids ran the group themselves pretty much you you want for what you want to do go on hikes or go sailing and stuff like that and yeah that was really good I think that was a really good yeah thing for me in life to to be able to do that did you feel like you had connected with something or it made sense in a way to give you a bit of Direction like oh there are some kids that I 've known you know most my life forunate and stuff and yeah I loved sailing and stuff like I 've done that in secondary school there 's a mile elective on Friday afternoons and and then yeah we 're doing that going on hikes and yeah made in girls you know there was yeah it wasn 't just boys it was good mixture probably 50 girls boys and girl yeah and then you go and meet other crew on annual caps and stuff like that yeah yeah yeah it 's not a sprite sort of thing to do sort of it yeah so I want to ask about how you know so you 've had few little missteps here and there but you 're coming out the other side of it as sort of in your late teens is that when you started your gardening business probably finished year 11 after wagang probably half of it i used to hitchhike i think i said so you can aha I just passed year 11 at the end of the year yeah there was just subjects I wasn 't interested in oh it 's probably more the teachers actually that just yeah I thought though just yeah didn 't have to love the subject though teaching the kids and stuff it you know I 'm pee and stuff you do an afternoon pay address nah not into this sort of thing and yeah hitchhike I 'm 30 Kay 's go back home go surfing or diving and stuff like that my mate used to do that so you 're the kind of person who you do things because of other people I think that that 's kind of a theme that 's emerging there ready that you know you didn 't like a subject at school because their passion for it and you know we 'll talk about this a bit more but it sort of seems that this is a bit of a theme in your life that you connect to things through the people that you work with I don 't want to put words in your mouth but it seems like you know you 're such a community minded person that 's Lex and I were talking about that before that you know he 's straight out of school you know you 're just this really community minded person and you care a lot about the people around you I think that comes from where I grew up in point on style small community town everyone sort of knew each other if that changed is we got older as the Melbourne people would come and buy up all the houses the cheap houses and turn them into holiday houses and yes so so half the town was empty most the year except for school holidays and stuff like that change is a town isn 't it yeah changed yeah and we couldn 't afford probably a lot of us ended up moving to other places because we couldn 't afford to live there oh geez what well I ran my gardening business until probably twenty three or four I was having a few problems from my back and doctor said James you got to do something different mate and I eventually going to end up in a wheelchair or something that was like yeah yeah I probably wasn 't that bad but this my doctor is dr. Jeff there 's here 's a classic doctor young doctor pretty wild sort of dude he 's the doctor for the John cats Ben last couple of decades named dr. Jeff yeah you get you know you 're gonna end up in a wheelchair also happens to be yeah we might get some like season tickets is that saying you can for a long time I 've needed him for a long time yes so and a friend of mine like I was getting right into photography in my yeah probably late teens early 20s selling it markets and putting in exhibitions and competitions and stuff and a two year course and Melbourne photography course and for a couple of years she said James you got to do this course he 's gonna do this course I moving to Melbourne and you know studying and living on our study I can 't do that but that was always in my head and then yeah I applied for this course after selling my gardening business and yet got in and that was one of the best two years of my life I reckon just but given all this film and stuff and just shoot as much as you like and learning off all these amazing photographers it was just a photography college like oh well all the students were from like people you know year 12 right through to people in their forties and stuff so everyone had a passion for photography and stuff and while some didn 't some of the you 12 just there you know to do it yeah and here we go this is you this young entrepreneur who sold his gardening business and moved to the Big Smoke to do for TV yeah my mates used to go to Melbourne all the time just drive up on a Friday night go see gigs and drive back in the early hours of the morning and I sitting on 160 km Elven Road yeah we touched on this because music sort of starts to come up sort of around this time that you 're going to all these gigs you mentioned to us before that you used to organize house parties was that back in point lines down that 's important style yeah music creative industries things it starts really young with you hey yeah it 's Phi was just thinking the other day for our small population of that town there 's been some amazing people that have come out of there my friend Hugo who I met in a pram well before he was born apparently he ran the queenscliff music festival for yet 10 plus years Jenny Davidson or moon she ran up for a year before that we 're all good friends together Matthew hi he 's been running garden plains and Meredith music festival [Music] probably you know probably a things realizing yeah yeah but yet growing up in that small town you know you go to the pub on a Friday and Saturday night after the pub you go to the pizza shop behind and then ya go to a party in someone 's house after that then yeah that sort of inspired me and then later on we thought alright let 's organise party and we done mine in my flat little two-bedroom flat amongst a group of three two-bedroom flats called the kennels and yeah we met Hugo and hurry and folky I think it was yeah we loaded up my Holden one ton of you full of cartons of beer worked out I think they costs less than a dollar a cheque an or something like that back then so we sold them for two bucks and it was a huge party it was 250 300 people we 're in this tiny little crammed like this area like this yeah the cops the cops come and gave us a warning to shut it down and it was impossible to shut down those donations for the beers fine so one of them wait so I think it was Ricky Moore he went around of a hat and yeah we 're not making fifty bucks more than the fire and kept the party going until about 00 in the morning we all know what we 're doing once isolation in this James is organizing a big party for Adam well you seem to have this great capacity for organizing things and you know being in a place where there are really creative people like Melbourne must have been like just you know food gods know our Melbourne in the eighties and nineties was going off you know yeah Angelo that 's where I used to hang out a lot the bar and club and stuff lots of grunge and punk bands and stuff yeah which friends are in and yeah yeah we just ended up and Hugo he was the DJ for PBS em now dig this show we used to done so we used to go to all these big blues gigs in that Melbourne and yeah yeah it 's very rich and I think the crazy whoa you weren 't really in the hub when it was buzzing with music events all of this opportunity so I guess the obvious question is when did you make the WI yeah well yeah I 've done my to use photography moved back to Poland style I want to be a National Geographic photographer because my love was like landscape seascape photography and stuff like that yeah and yeah you know it was impossible no and employs photographers sort of thing in those days so I thought and I was in my mid-20s brokers you know I 've been living on a study like when I budget my rent my food I 'd have about 20 dollars per week leftover so that was great in Melbourne geeks two dollars or mostly free go buy one stubby and sit there and watch but yeah I returned a Lonsdale and I was there for a few months and thought no I 'm break I 'm getting old I 've hit 21 and I I 've got to go catch up somehow yeah so I 've heard of khau Galli few friends 've heard of cowboy like people have heard of you know like Brisbane or people over heard of you know even brew but like how Ghoulies yes locally but ya know Calgary it was a place to go in Australia go and cash up yeah it 'll become clear now but I didn 't do my research well y 'all_''_1394.549 racked up there didn 't have a trade it was in a bit of a downturn in the mining industry but yeah I got a few jobs here and yeah it was pretty lonely sort of place to live actually Calgary I thought but I used to go out and weekends and explore all the old gold mining towns and stuff yeah well always appreciate the bush you should always go camping with mates back you know we had the Otways in our back yard and stuff like that rain forests in stir it 's funny like I I often like to see how pods could have crossed with people that I meet you know before before we actually met and got to know each other and I 'm sure cowboy your the region or Geraldton they were probably in Kalgoorlie and at some point I was in Kalgoorlie in the 90s and you know don 't you sort of wonder who you might have walked past and yeah in those places cuz regional w-a is like that right you know Oh get ready for another name drop Oh when I was in college yeah got to cowgirl you know I was in LA with Public Radio and I lived over east and yeah yeah got the Kalgoorlie on all the best thing you listen to is triple j and pretty much hated triple j when I lived in Melbourne we took is community radio community radio is brought to you by presenters to say a one or two hour show who loved that type of music you know whether it 's Blues Punk whatever yeah and yeah they 're just so he 's listened to and learn and they 're the ones that play the music before triple j gets it yeah yeah so yeah i 'll star for music living in Kalgoorlie and every now and then you here and one trio that used to come there a couple of girls and a guy I 've called the wife 's they come through every couple of months or so and that play at the Kalgoorlie hotel I think it was up on the deck there was no in there you know it might be five or sometimes all I might be down me one and so I struck up a friendship with them and and one of their last gigs there just before I left they set up you know weird leaving waa we 're moving to Mel wanna go hang on he 's some phone numbers Hugo was one of them and a few other crew and yeah they ended up hooking up with some good crew and Melbourne and which helped them they have a connection here or the girls apparently lived here for a little bit embarrassed I think so yeah this is Ray 's OWA there 's always like this is what my my this is what my neighbor Alan tells me that but yeah you know they always mentioned their shows here you someone broke in our camper van and stole our underwear and stuff like that oh yeah then the next time I saw them they are on tour with weddings parties anything when their own a sort of peeking wow they were supporting them they were like sorry James yeah now we 've connected really well so you ended up in carefully and you in it 's it 's in a bit of a slump and sort of things aren 't going great what were you were you thinking like I 'm just gonna sweat it out or what how did you get out of that I was still broke yeah pain shitloads of money for a house Branson stuff yeah and another mate who was in the year above me in photography school he was living there with his girlfriend he was having a hard time and it was a bit of a alkie I think and we used to go out to the pubs and stuff and another friend he studied with you 're above me Jane she was travelling around Australia in a combi and she coming yeah months and then she said come on James let 's go let 's go to broom and get work up there yes I 've managed to save a bit of money by that stage yeah say yeah we took two weeks to we left Kalgoorlie went up to qu Carney Niagara dam hanging out there just to sort of de-stress yeah I was on my u7 camp at KU Kearney oh wow yeah I can 't remember the people who run the ku Kearney pub they 're still there now yeah and I had floods there many years ago she showed me they 've got this big scorpion which must be you know about that long that once the water had gone out you know dropped it was in the pallet Oh crazy anyway you got an eye exam and then what 's it yeah then we arrived in Geraldton in October 97 I think and it was yeah it was sunshine festival time oh and we arrived and there was like this Mexican I think or some Fiesta damn marine Terrace we 're top early knees and Fleur and good fun yeah and then on the Sunday night down a pages beach they had all these huge big puppets and a string quartet playing and stuff and I just returned a moment that was presented by the Arts Council which is Kath wielding a flower and a few others back then yeah but yeah I didn 't really get to know them until later years sort of thing because we 'll just yeah coming to stock up yeah yeah then we 'll camp the Drummond 's Cove on our final night sitting on the beach this guy brings up a fresh Tyler he 'd caught any gay guys and so we lit a fire and cooked it wait wasting to town the next day to stock up with groceries and stuff in Jane 's combi and I broke down in town and I 've heard this story so many times in Geraldton especially because zombies don 't like heat you know they 're an air-cooled motor and stuff and they tend to blow valves and stuff and break down and chill yeah it 's funny this like there 's recently that they got stuck here because of the virus and they 've actually decided to stay I saw that they bought a house a story it 's like I tried to leave but I couldn 't and now I 'm here and making it a better place when we went in a lockdown you know I was going down to the beach and some are thinking where else would you want to be is just stunning here this time you know that 's what called the Windy City on Earth pretty much but it 's only for a probably over three four month period where you get a week or a few days real wind and then it drops off a bit so yeah I was hitching outta town to get my car up at drummer 's Cove I was out front of north gate and there 's this big old orange beautiful old Fairlane and he 's tooted his horn he 's pulling out beside Hungry Jack 's theory and just before that I 'd found this quite an expensive snorkel that used for diving and stuff and and he 's going oh where you go and go kind of Drummond 's to pick up my car he goes jump in we 're driving along and he goes oh I thought you had a car part in you hey and that 's why I pulled over you guys off I 'm only just going up the road here I live at the lighthouse keepers cottage in Bluff Point and then you guys are hanging on I 'll just drop my shopping off and give you a you know a lift T car and so we 're going in and he said come in and check out the joint it 's just this amazing you know old lighthouse keepers cottage and stuff and and he 's invited us back for dinner that night beautiful Jew fish and salads and always there was someone definitely pulling some strings out there being like I think he had a knife a giant because she was pretty stunning girl oh yeah from Melvin and stuff and very interesting girl and and this was Mitch Clarkson whose name was yeah powers and he was loved Mitch yeah yeah and going back to a party that weekend it was some big party and meeting all these a fishing community all these great amazing people yeah you know we ended up going to the islands within a couple of weeks on yeah Greg oh it 's great I forgot sorry great fun Greg 's boat because it was when a cry fishing season had the seasons for the islands and you know they 'd go over a couple of weeks before get the camp already do the servicing and stuff and and would just go out fishing and you know hang out and take photos and that and the opportunity to get to the islands so quickly after arriving in Gerald yeah there 's a lot of us who still having me now I think it helps to be hanging out of a nice-looking girl sorry so you 've come to Germany you kind of start to you know fit in with the community here was there was there a point where like you went I 'm gonna stay I 'm gonna stay here because I other people and interviews and we 've also talked about that like when is that point when you go yeah this is the place for me um oh gee it was a long time I reckon it was this number of years before felt oh I 'm happy here now because Jana and I we ended up camping all around different places and stuff and we ended up staying at the grinev caravan park we both had a dog age she had an Alsatian and and as time went on the dogs were getting territorial their camp and stuff so we got moved further and further back in the caravan park and there 's this stage we 're thinking well I think we 're gonna get kicked out and we saw this house in the paper it was a farmhouse out up when you know coop speedway beautiful old hundred-year-old house and it was a hundred bucks a week and when looked at oh yeah it 's pretty good and the girl the real estate said off you you know say you 'll take it for a long ways you 'll take it at five years I was like a six-month term we could renegotiate yeah five usual to you something like that but yeah it was like I don 't wanna stay here that long but you can get out of those things if you want to exactly was that your approach like okay you 'll say just so we can get the house back hmm I 'm not really committed to five years yeah but we had to get jobs and stuff so she could yeah very conditioner combi and stuff and that 's how we got to make some more amazing people in community Paul Robb was one from industry and landed the team I want to I want to ask you about that because I we we know a bit of the background of how of how you came to well how you know Paul but how why was a weird that you met him here in Geraldton what I 've got invited to this party Jane was working the African reef and another guide Jeremy her workmates had come to his place for a party she was working and she turned up later but I 've turned up walked in the gate walking up beside the house and again god I know that face cuz he 's got quite a unique sort of face well he 's tall yeah I suppose yeah just he stand yeah and I and we ended up working out that he grew up on the bel-air Peninsula as well Wow like 20 kaiza way from where I did was a year above me in school at Tech was also an adventurer group a different one but you know we 'd made up once a year or whatever you call him jam breweries or whatever yeah yeah so and yeah we 've got chatting and he 's invited me along to an industry and land meeting and yeah officer needed community groups and stuff then but I thought I 'll just go along you know check it out cuz he told me a little bit about it how they want to put this heavy industrial state up a tokuji on the right on the coast and I 've been here for how valuable it was to this community because pretty much there was phishing and pharming that ran the town economically worsened and just a beautiful coast and yeah yeah coming from Geelong and industrial city I saw what yeah negative things can happen at times with industrial cities you know strikes and stuff like that but and incidents you know where spillages happen that can spoil a whole other industry sort of thing that 's what I was worried about with the crow fishing industry and that group was made up of a heap of different people from all over the world yeah there was doctors and all sorts of things really interesting people who yeah nude if everyone knew the different things and that 's what helped keep that organization going a long time bringing all these economic facts and stuff like that Edie ended up the thing ended up falling over anyway when King streams steel yeah ended up undoing itself and that 's when I moved on to they give me Geraldton any day positive campaign because the town was down the dumps and the city brought and that been going through the similar situations and they 've done all these events and stuff to make the boost the city yeah and you went home after she spoke one night got home about 30 or something watching the news saw Running of the Bulls in Pamplona and Spain and oh hang on his APIs shape you let 's do something similar like that so yeah ended up bringing this idea up at one of our cafe things we 've done you know where you 've made up and bringing ideas up and everyone 's got got yeah that 's great that ended up bein a crazy thing because the city wanted the City of Greater Geraldton listen they wanted permission from the RSPCA which you know it 's fair enough you know you can 't go chucking heap of people in a FIFA sheep and scaring the hell out of them and hurting them and stuff and that 's good that actually made the events even better than what we planned because we had to do things differently so instead of running people with sheep we ran Kiwis and now and I was in the 301 night I 'm talking I just I was waiting for a beer and it 's doing the suits turn around you said g 'day and yeah and he was the manager of Flight Center and I got talking to him and he he said yeah will sponsor a one-way flight back to New Zealand for the prize for that so we had a bet we had I think there was 11 Kiwis or something okay yeah it 's funded the guy at Wanat Phil Blake way had picked up hitchhiking from Perth he 'd come from New Zealand looking for his missus who had nicked off and she was rousing in some shearing shed he 's trying to find her and taking him under his arms to help him out and stuff he 's end up winning and we had other things like the new beauty competition where we teamed up for hairdressers and for Shearer 's yeah and they 'd have a sheep each yeah oh poor sheep and they 'd cheer and call them and all that yeah and well where we had 100 sheep from Phil 's or from new car and we trucked him in dumped him outside the Free Masons hotel which was closed for the day it was like a 35 degree day everything 's time for a drink in it they closed because they thought there would be too many people wanting to use the toilets just go back to 99 you know back in the current so yeah we had a hundred I had to go around and get sponsorship we got these sheep jackets and a business would sponsor him 50 bucks and they could put their logos and also yes I that and we had about 5,000 people jammed between the Freemasons and the banks we had to put ring lock fencing along all the parking poles to keep the sheep in on the road and stuff and there 's like five six people deep all the way along this is just unreal and we are gonna if we don 't move on we 're gonna keep unpacking this yeah was that kind of the point where you were like all it may be reinforced or did it kind of spur you along to keep moving in that direction of events potentially arts engaging community um all those things together I 'm trying to think that what I think yeah after doing that people seek me out and yeah I got sort of pressured into take on the presidency of the Arts Council because Kath wheeldin been doing well over a decade or so and she needed to take a step down those things you know you usually do a two-year term and then pass on to someone it 's yeah it does it 's volunteer and you know it cost me a lot of time to run that with Roxanne and the committee and stuff like that but we had a great time doing things but you guys got up to some really cool crazy things yeah yeah we done we pack so much in those two years and you wouldn 't do in a lifetime sometimes yeah yeah bringing artists to town performance artists and doing all these crazy things and some of those artists are still living here cheap it was to live here the space and a great creative place to be yeah you guys have yourself yeah we talked about this I think you know every interview somehow Geraldton is this beautiful creative place and I think it 's like people like you and or like anyone really find a home here you know that you have this origin of being this like you know the bush and you know like having a connection to the natural world and yeah I 'm okay that you just given away that there 's no tea in there he 's just virtual team but you you know you you had this connection to the land and you had a connection to community and a connection to events and when you came to Geraldton it might have taken you a few years but you found that here and that 's probably mean editorializing but i think that this is children that kind of place where you can find the things that you value in life they 're all here well I think you know you can agree with me coming thriving communities and stuff cities and that you come here and you can just see potential plus here the the size of the city you know it 's like I grew up in a small town lived in big cities and stuff and I just eventually thought this is a great place we 've got amazing hinterland rural areas out east of here and north and stuff beautiful coastline and ocean you know you go in the ocean now it 's like 20 degrees the water it 's just amazing yeah and who wants to live in the city even if it 's a smaller city like Perth or whatever you still got to travel through traffic and I used to do that Melbourne I take me 45 minutes to drive to school on the way I am out of peak hour it 'd be like 20 minutes yeah and yeah here you know 10-15 minutes anyway sort of thing easily yeah and potential isn 't it I think the both of us picked up on that that it 's like that what you were talking about is that this its potential and I think maybe that 's how we get onto the last bit of the talk about about Nakara and you know how that came about how it started and you know how you sort of brought together this event with a team of people over so many years how did it you know how did you see that potential go from seeing the potential having this beautiful event yeah that 's what I started out like I met Phil Blake way through the running in the Sheep he had the Sheep someone introduced me and yeah cuz as whole group of us all knew each other we used to go out there for parties for years you know at the Nansen pub that was when now as none of the infrastructure it 's there now there was just a little hut made out of tin and bark and stuff under these beautiful gum trees few big stone fireplaces no bridges or anything you 'd have to go through the mud and the creeks you know you 'd sit there a few beers are they gonna get through promoting bands traveling bands to come to Geraldton and stuff you know pretty much after the dc days and for quite a while and someone sit around the file James why don 't you get some bands out here well yeah we got a stage and Phil said yeah I 'll build a stage and he which he did and we 've done our first little event in 2004 Dave Mann collective and a couple of local acts and yeah it was just amazingly well supported and that we 're just slowly you know went along there and um yeah now he 's got two stages out there and I know how many years now is it 14 years jeez enough years that you can 't remember how many yeah yeah next year 's 15th and final yeah and yeah I mean it 's just such a huge fate but do you spend like do you reflect back and just think wow you know do you have any thoughts of like that was really great or I really learned a lot about this like what do you reflect on when collectively that fester and our community please good question now one minute I 'm not going back to the sheep either I think that the rule is if you do anything start off smallish like we did then just perfect as you go and look back on it and debrief with each other and stuff and just and that 's how we eventually grew grew that festival as well as their wedding and function business you know which went along side by side with that sort of thing yeah and just great people to work with and the volunteers they 've been there from the start you know all those 14 15 years and yeah just bringing community together you know that that that 's been the most amazing thing seeing all those people happy people out there just loving it and you 're getting all this feedback from everywhere yeah I think even speaking as an artist who has played the opportunity like do you have an opportunity and be able to stay local to know that we can work towards something is so special and unique and I is yeah you know the opportunity that artists get as well to hook in with with the festival and that people over the years everyone who 's had that chance to play on a stage to play in a festival setting for some of us it 's a first opportunity to really get a taster for that that 's that 's yeah it 's all mostly artists are visiting touring acts you know some international acts and that but that 's why I like to bring them here so other musicians like yourself and that can learn by saying them you don 't get those opportunities too often and also yet to put on a couple of or quite a few local acts you know on the Sunday morning and on the Saturday night you get to mix of those other crew and you 're fine they 're just humans those you know famous artists and stuff and you learn from them and they yeah it 's a great part of you know to bring it sort of back to the Geraldton you know the Geraldton is this kind of and just start small and perfect and I first moved to town when all the cafe is down at the West End was saying to open and I remember you know a few times you 'd go to places and maybe the coffee wasn 't as good as it would be if they 've been running for ages but people were so not forgiving but so you know invested in building the businesses in the community around them and saying well I know they 're going to get better and now they they all have and that kind of festival and the artists locally you know this is a great kind of like community we 're all invested in making our community better yeah and like I said you know you you 've been a great part of that even a new car is technically not it was really great at you know that for so many people in this region this has been something that we haven 't had you know in in that 's in its iteration in this time it 's it 's unique and it 's of the whole region and that was inspired from earlier times you know when I went to the first one of the first Meredith music festivals it was tiny little festival out in the bush everyone just camped around the outside and it was very similar to that new care environment that was and yeah I just when I asked there I thought I just flashback to Meredith oh what a great time I had there yeah that 's what Geraldton needs yeah I guess there wasn 't much guy there was the Red Hill concerts going on sort of thing but yeah they this was just a little bit different yeah it 's so great and I guess it just says we close our segment good question I 've been really enjoying this lockdown sort of time yeah yeah it 's just and actually I 'll paint busy as ever anyway with work yeah yeah no nope no big plans or anything on just yeah just gonna ride the way for a little bit longer and I think if your life so far has been anything to go by that we 'll see in a couple years or you know so we 'll have to keep an eye on I think yeah yeah see see what happens I 've got to an age now where I like smaller intimate things like doing their backyard concerts and little smaller gigs and stuff so back to the kennels party 500 into the backyard just for just friends so yeah together less responsibilities are pretty much the Nakara guest list yeah thank you James yeah thanks girls really I 'm packin story and get to know you behind all of your feats and your musical events and also just like the ton of other things that you bring to our town and with that I think this is a really nice way to close our segment for qpt time this week thank you so much guys we have loved chatting to you I 'm Lex and this is Rosie and this is James and we 've loved talking to you we hope that you enjoyed this chat with James Thompson _"

    "text": "hey everybody with gardening grabbed some going this is a me and popping up from the ground like a grub or a plant anyway today so yeah today we 're gonna show you a very easy way of increasing sweet potatoes or planting more basically they 're super duper easy to grow all you need is a sweet potato or if you walk past a sweet potato bush you can just chop off a length so what I 've done here is I 've got this is a sweet potato runner they can take over a place I 've seen some spots where they virtually are taking over a place you need like a whippet that 's it because I love it in this SuperDuper SuperDuper easy to to make more of to grow more sweet potatoes so what we 're going to do is we 're going to cut this one up into sections and we 're going to cut this sweet potato into hards and we 're gonna suspend them in water and I 'll show you a good way of doing it so my um my show is going to chop her sweet potato in half and she 's going to sharpen some sticks to make some prongs so we can suspend the sweet potato in water and this will make the sweet potato want to put some roots out which is a really good sign because that means that we can chuck it in the ground and it 's going to grow basically so anyway while she 's doing that I 've got this vine here and this got some real big leaves and we can just rip these big leaves off because the vine here is having a hard time keeping the moisture to them at the moment because I ripped it out a couple it and maybe an hour or two ago you want to do it as quickly as you can and if you if you don 't have any time just chuck it in a bucket of water anyway but I 'm ripping these big leaves off because they take a lot of moisture to keep to keep full and happy so ripping big leaves off and I 've just left to see that there 's a little chutes here 's a couple of the smaller leaves coming popping out growing out from the side this is this is great because basically these are going to be the UM this is going to be the start of your new potato plant and what you can do is you can get your para second tears or a knife or if you 're really rough you can just also cut it yourself but we 're going to cut it just like that so we 've got a length like that that 's a short length if you 've got good soil that should be fine and what we do be just oh you have a bucket or something like that you just chuck it in a bucket and leave it 's got simple gardening not not crazy hectic got a 10 things sweet potato is a robust and versatile so that was a pretty short one you can also do some longer ones you can bury them in the ground so that just the little leaves pop up and they go boo boo boo nodes here will pop out roots when it finds moisture and it finds nutrients and they 'll just do their thing and before you know it you 'll have things popping up so you can just chuck that straight in the ground and bury it or you can chuck it into a pot because after a while they will shoot out roots or you could just if you 're not ready to put it in the ground yet you can just keep them in a pot until you are ready to put it in the ground it 's as simple as that now each one of these if they 're successful they send out their shoots and their leaves and all that sort of stuff and they gather all the nutrients from the Sun and the air and the ground and things and you should be able to every successful plant that you put in you should be able to get a sweet potato in like six eight months whatever you can just pop them in forget about it and then when you feel in a bit hungry you can haze am can you go out in the backyard and get me a couple of sweet potatoes and off she goes into that yard and she five six around and gets a couple of sweet potatoes we 've got some big ones before and there you go chop them up make some chips Oh everyone loves chips anyway these sweet potatoes we 've got this pokey spikey sticks we 're going to pop a stick in each in three parts of this sweet potato here one two looks like a little person alright so I 'll pop them in on the Angus of it the sweet potato will sit easier in the jar so I 'll get the jar of water I 'll get the jar here and that should just sit in the jar whether its bottom in the bottom down further in the jar so you don 't have to fill that up with so much water and you fill it up with water these has got some seeds from the last demonstration that we did for for y 'all_''_365.13 there we go and that you can pop it and all of us one day you 'll see like little white wormy things coming off the bottom and it might even be shooting green green shoots off the top another way is the really easy way is to just leave it in a dark space and generally a sweeps Taylor has enough energy in it to pop its own little root it 's so little leaves no you can think about it constantly and compose music to it and things like that but basically sweet potato soup easy let it let it sprout its leaves chop it in half chuck it in the garden it 'll do its thing it 'll take over your needle whipper snipper to get rid of it but they are delicious and you can even eat the fresh young leaves as well mmm more or less Russell put him in a car you 'll put him in a salad they 're lovely thanks everyone happy gardening _"

    "text": "hello everybody once again this is nola gregory and community and aboriginal development officer for the city of greater georgia we 're coming to you from the queen 's park theatre because of social distancing the theater has been closed down we 're celebrating national reconciliation week with this year 's theme we 're in this or in this together and we 've got a few things a few people that we 're going to introduce you to along the way but before we do this i would like to acknowledge i would like to respectfully acknowledge the yamaji peoples who are the traditional owners and first peoples of the land on which we are meeting today the nunanggari i would like to pay my respects to the elders past present and future for they hold the memories and traditions the culture and hopes of the yamaji peoples so this year 's theme is all about aboriginal people and non-aboriginal people walking together and starting a journey recognizing aboriginal people 's culture and our past history so that 's the reason behind this year 's theme in this together and usually write poems about the themes for national risk at reconciliation week and night week so this poem is called in this together we 're all in this together so let the journey begin open up your minds and take a look deep within now is a healing time between black man and white let 's uncover hard truths make all our wrongs right the wounds of our history together we will share start with understanding with pride and with care collectively build relationships with value and trust futures histories and cultures are a definite must we are all in this together our aussie nation is so vast the healing of our future must start with our past i stand with you you stand with me i learn from you you learn from me next one i 'd like to read for you is um corroboree about 1992-1995 i worked in the kimberley in both the west kimberley and the east kimberley i was the personal assistant for pdu who was with the kimberley land council the head office at that time was based in derby so um when i the old people um a lot of them have gone on and passed away now but they looked after me really well while i was up there some of them i didn 't even know were my own family that we 've reconnected with just recently so this is about them they had a big meeting out at um that i was fortunate enough to attend out at will air on the other side of the bridge and every night after the meetings i would do big robberies and i 'll tell you until you see it in in its natural environment you haven 't seen anything so that 's what this poem is about it 's called corroboree i can hear the chanting of the language loud and clear i can hear them singing without prejudice or fear and the dust slowly rises to the sound of stomping feet it 's like a pulse inside me i feel each and every beat proudly they are dancing to an ancient age-old song adorned with precious ochre as they move and sing along the old men sit cross-legged in the red robust there is no explanation for what i feel inside as i stand there watching i am full of aboriginal pride the freedom on their faces is a sight to behold as they stamp their feet you can hear the storylines unfold their voices are so haunting as you listen to them sing rising on the swirling winds it 's the most powerful thing i am mesmerized by the dancers as they jump and twirl and grind it 's something that has stuck with me it 's emblazoned on my mind truly a memorable time up there in derby and working with the kimberley land council a couple of years ago we had a we had a theme for naidoc called truth telling and that 's what this poem is all about it 's called truth telling take a trip with me a journey let 's walk across the pages of time and open up the conversation of long ago historical crimes together let us face the truth telling from the broken and mournful hearts sit and listen as we teach you of our buried ghostly past don 't shy 's remember them with dignity not finger-pointing and blame and together we can heal old wounds that have festered for far too long admitting that it really happened we must write the terrible wrongs so open wide the files of old take a look at what 's inside the stories will be confronting but they are stories we must not hide if we want to heal this nation from the trauma of the past we must start the truth telling reveal the secrets that are hard to grasp then together we will face it as you learn and as you grow how we got to where we stand is a truth we all must know hearing our history is necessary it 's something we will not hide it is the only way forward for genuine healing on both sides just got a couple more to read to you this one is titled apology and in 2008 on the fifth i think it was the eighth of february actually the 8th of february 2008 the then prime minister kevin rudd apologized apologised officially apologized in parliament to the stolen generations now was taken away from her country kidro country and never ever returned there never met her family again never saw her mother and father again she lived all her life on a mission um grew up there and when when she left she came to jordan and and that 's where she lived in an adopted country so this is about the apology in silence you have suffered your pain locked deep inside you fought so long for this and still you kept your pride the tears of all the mothers for their children they did cry their broken hearts and memory etched in the children 's eyes born of a strong proud people never would you forget the anguish and the burdens now your life had all been set but the yearning was still a part of you you just did not feel right something here was missing missing and you knew you had to fight and fight you did throughout the years to parliaments pollies and all how could you make them listen would they heed your heartfelt calls all you wanted was an apology not thinking it little word was asking for this so wrong a flood of overwhelming emotions will be felt on this memorable day and those who have gone before us in spirit will lead the way the stolen generations will stand with hands on hearts and today the tears flow freely and this is just the start you heard me speak about my grandmother her name is minnie daly as i said she come from kids country up in turkey creek area and i wrote a poem about her sometimes i wish that i could just sit cross-legged on the floor with her and wish that she was there that i could talk to her and learn her story she was very proud woman and this is what this is about it 's about actually about um her mother and what happened to her mother and it and it 'll um the story should tell itself it 's called blood in the kitchen sand if you were still alive today and i could sit and talk with you what would you tell me great nam would you reveal something new there 's not death was there blood in the kid your sand as you took your dying breath we would love to learn your story to find out who you were not just maggie full blood as it was written without a care day after day we hunger and year after year we look and search through worn out pages and in every historical book but if i could just sit and talk with you for just a little while would you tell me your broken story and would i be angry and wild i know some hearts would be mended we have cried for so very long to hear of your kid your story to the country to which you belong there 's blood in the kids and it trickles through every grain it 's the heart cry of our fallen to a ghostly white skinned stain it is a permanent reminder of a past full of blood and heat and it is there as proof to all that history should never repeat just got two more poems for you this one that this one 's really special it 's about a of aboriginal people out there will know about granny ruiz in the old days as people know we had reserves here in geraldton and granny reese had a house up on top of the hill not far from the reserve on one side and blood alley on the other and um there was a path you people used to make their way to granny reese 's place so this poem is dedicated to granny reese and all of her children grandchildren and great grandchildren for years i 've heard the stories of the old reserve days when i listened to the elders talk of all the good old ways and one of those deadly stories was about granny reese and all of the many visits to her old house for tea so fondly do they talk of her and remember her lovely place situated on the hill in johnson street she would welcome many a face there was a big old tree in the front yard with beautiful summer shade people would sit there yarning and that is where they stayed it was right next door to the old reserve along it to blood alley just over the way then up to granny reese 's place they would wander for a look to see what was happening at granny 's welcoming nook i can remember that old place up on the hill many years of walking down to the foreshore walking down to the front beach sitting down there with fish and chips sharing them with sisters and brothers and going for a swim on hot days and grant we would walk past granny 's place on the way to the front beach downtown okay folks the last poem i 've got for you today is is a naidoc poem and this year 's theme for naidoc is always was always will be so that 's what the poem is titled our story begins at the dawn of time a proud race of people strong cultural bloodlines

    "text": "hello I 'm Peter Forenza and welcome to see GG TV very lucky at the moment to speak to a good friend of mine in Glen Bandhan he 's known as mr. football in this area but his history in football is a long one and I 'm glad we can have this chat Glenn thanks for joining us well Glen you started off as a Chapman Valley boy and really loved you footy tell us how fully started for you mom and dad used to take me to the footy each weekend and I really enjoyed that I was very small player but I used to be pretty courageous I think went in pretty hard I was a bit slow it wasn 't very tall and it wasn 't very strong but I joined the footy and I went through and played right up to Colts and then I played reserves and a bit of League fully in the end so you know I had a really good time but I go footy away at about 21 used to get concussion a little bit too much and in the belted up each week to do that and thought about my health so I decided to do other things but I was always involved in the club right from the start I was a very young committee man probably 18 soon as I left school high school that is I went back onto the farm and got involved in in the local community and the local footy club now you tell me a story when you 're a little fella I think with the hippies and so on and so forth at Valley primary school 40 was was pretty big for the population out there and when Country week happened you could listen to games on the radio and you tell me about times you duck under the desk at school just to listen to the broadcast yeah we used to sneak into the Headmaster 's office and turn on the radio to secretly and listen I remember listening to Victor cabe one day calling the footy it was so exciting to listen to country week footy and hear the names of the local players and I think you know having success a lot of the players there were players from Chapman Valley footy club I knew a lot of the players from Northampton so it 's really quite exciting so I 've always been a little bit of a person who loves my footie and can 't get enough of it now broadcasting wise he started off on the scoreboard doing it didn 't you I didn 't the table telling me to shut up Dana not listen to you but they had to I was only a primary school person but I was working on the school board putting the scores up but calling the footy as I went and probably to the annoyance of people on the school board side of the NAP arrival and then you got invited to join the team of Mike Murphy and Brian Potter Smith yeah initially I started working at 6 G as doing the Footy Show for the Chapman Valley footy club which was sponsored by meta Kelly 's the jewelers at the time so I did that for a few years and eventually had an opportunity to work alongside deal of fun really enjoyed it and they were both very very good in helping me out and giving me an opportunity and I had a lot of laughs over both very very funny men and both very good commentators and of course you watch them you saw them do their do that do it game in games weekend and week out and when did you have the opportunity to take over the microphone well I did initially and then I left because I went back to Chapman Valley because it was an opportunity Danny Cunningham who had been the president he left the community and left town and I needed someone to be the president so I stood up and took on the chair in Valley Football Club presidency for three three years I was only 24 at the time so I did it you know for those three years had a great deal of fun we didn 't have a lot of success as in winning a Premiership or anything at like that but we had some really great players we had John Sims as our coach and we finished probably fourth or fifth or six some years you know our side was very very competitive and you know I 'd put it alongside sides of today and they 'd be very very very very competitive and would do a pretty good job it 's still called football today I 'm so fortunately I 'm able to do it with the Glen what what drives you to continue to get out to a footy match and cool again for the public well I just love the community spirit and the fact that footy is more than a game there 's an old saying of course but the fact that you can go out there and you know although people are burying for different teams they respect each other we respect each other 's love of each other 's clubs we know that people in those clubs are very loyal and we know that they do a lot of work behind the scenes for no money so it 's really great to see and the pliers you know it 's been very encouraging you know I mean calling footie of players come and go I 've also seen a lot of premierships I 've also seen a lot of now sons playing footy and I saw their fathers play and that 's great excitement to me to see the family tradition so it 's really great to see family loyalty and tradition and although that 's gone out there we know a little bit in community it 's still very very strong of course being in the commentary box we 're so privileged Glen to see some of the the raw talent that comes out of the the G NFL and it must just continue to amaze you well it does you know I 've been lucky enough to see some great players across the years some that have gone on and played waffle and AFL football some that haven 't and they 've all you know have a place in my heart I really respect the players who can play and play as well as they do and we 've seen some great debuts over the years some really exciting players and it 's really heartening to see in the street and talk to them after 30 years and still be able to talk about their days at the footy field and I mean if we talk about some of the great players that have gone on to bigger and better things you see motor instead from a youngster Chris plain wearing we saw people like Jack Martin even Josh Kennedy pull on the boots yes I was lucky enough just starting off my commentary career when Murray Reince did he was playing footy at Easter mantle on a Saturday and coming back to play for railways on a Sunday that was really exciting and you could see from the start he was a super player very very clever and very very strong hardly ever got tackled he always seemed to have plenty of time Murray R instead we spoke about I was lucky enough to go down with Mike Murphy and part of Smith when Chris monring played his first country wheat game so we could see something pretty special there and he was able to go on with it and in more recent times of course his father Darren Ryan play and Darren was a super place as he was his Darren 's brother and Bob he was outstanding and then I saw young Liam come and I really had a lot of time for Liam all the way through and he played his footy here then he went to Subiaco and won a couple of grand finals got a setback he didn 't get selected in the AFL Draft but he was good enough to keep fighting on he got his opportunity and now he 's a premise ship player at the West Coast what a wonderful story it is about Liam Ryan because I mean to come from somewhere like from Geraldton and and probably you know we talked about his dad Darren and and he 's Uncle Bob they were absolute legends but to get a lift up and be able to go down to the West Coast Eagles and to be over go go to the heights that he has is incredible for a Yemeni boy from here is know it 's great shows a lot of resilience because he could have he didn 't he continued to persevere and that 's a great thing to his mentor 's but it 's also a great thing to Liam that he 's been able to work hard and now he 's getting the reward he deserves do you think Liam Ryan is the latest him in what has been a host of players that have gone from the G NFL do you think the future is going to see more of these youngsters coming through well as you touched on you know I 've had Josh Kennedy we 've had Jamie crypts we 've had Patrick crypts I 've had some really super players that have come through the area and particularly through Northampton but every club has had a sprinkling of talent so that 's good to see but yeah I think we will in the coming years we know that Tom Carroll is Jack Carroll I should say Jack Carroll is up for you know selection the not-too-distant future we 've got young McVie Jed he 's another player he 's going to probably do very well and young young Haig are now around the place ik was Richard Bartlett 's another player around the place so yeah in the short to medium term we 're looking to do okay when you look at our East Fremantle Colts side which goes to Perth and performs I 'd say eight or ten of those players with Geraldton background so that 's pretty encouraging out of a number of 40 so yeah we 're doing okay but I do have concerns into the future we need the people to work hard at club level to continue to produce those players and that is a concern a lot of people say if a player is good they 're going to make it anyway and I think you 've touched on the also-rans in the competition how important they are Glen they are and I think everyone the to be acknowledged and I think that 's what the WAFL have probably fallen down a little bit because in recent years the AFL have taken control of the WAFL Colts competition and you know that certainly would annoy me if I was a member of those G NFL clubs can still can keep control of the Colts competition here and still distribute the Flyers to each no matter when they 're ready but I 'd like to see players stay here a little bit longer we have seen that the things that have come with Kovan 19 there may be a reduction in coaching numbers at AFL level so there 'll be less players there so they may not get drafted as early so you know if they don 't get drafted as early they can go on and play at local level G NFL level until they are very good and then go to each team adilyn and do it the way you know someone like Harry Taylor has done it Harry Tyler was a reasonably good footballer here before he went and spent his ground years at Eastern mantle and as some insure player he 's gone on to have a significantly and a very impressive career at ulong so there 's lots of ways to do it and I would just like to think that we could retain players in our own competition play at the WAFL level and hopefully AFL level then we 've touched on players that have gone to the AFL and there 's often been a lot of criticism about money being at the top of the tree in the AFL not trickling down and that we know that these players you talk about the Liam Ryan 's the Josh Kennedy 's we talk about the the Martens and we talk about you know the crips boys how are they going to continue to come through when when grassroots footy team tends to struggle yeah I think people are getting a little bit annoyed you know that the fact is there is so much money or there was so much money and I still think there is money at the top level but we need to see a little bit diluted so we don 't need players here to be paid or the clubs to be supported in any other way but to buy infrastructure buy footballs help buy Guernsey 's those sort of things pay insurances there are sort of things that people can help with we get the footy Commission believe if you give country people money they 'll spend it on trying to buy players no one 's saying the money doesn 't need to be spent on buying players we 've got enough good players here we can develop them and if people and clubs want to pay their players that 's their business but it doesn 't need to be taken from the top level it 's not paying players we need to do we need to have good coaches in place and we talked about being able to keep players in this competition longer well we know we have got good coaches across the board the seven senior coaches a gnf a level of very good coaches and I would like to see each team at will work with those coaches and say we want this player to play off a halfback flank we needs to work harder in this area of his game and next time he goes back to eastery medal they see an improvement in that part of his game he doesn 't really need to play at each team numbers for them when he could be playing footy here improving this footballs competition improving his football but still be under the guidance of you know someone up the ladder or each team al who tells the G NFL coaches how did he play this week what did he do right what did he do wrong what do we need to improve that players game and you know there 's his ways of keeping people in the competition for longer and I think that would improve because at the moment when I was growing up the players that were playing were probably 26 27 on average now the probably 19 and 20 across-the-board it 's a completely different competition it was a man 's competition in you know the 70s and 80s and probably even into the 90s but since the West Coast Eagle came in in 1987 since then the competition has drifted away and there 's less people playing at senior level jobs have changed two people have different careers now and different expectations from their employer so a lot of people can 't work as much as did because they have employment issues things are a little bit different in that so we see players retiring earlier and we have a very young and fair to say we have a development competition that 's as simple as that even that League level a lot of our players are just young men at the moment as we speak the AFL hopefully is going to have a season start early in June then I know it 's an unknown but the future of football post covert 19 what can you see well it is a concern but the fact is we have seven clubs here in the G NFL there is some concern about the viability long term of Mullah war but I think the other six clubs financially are pretty secure and they also are secure in membership and in support so you know there is still a great future here none of our clubs are spending money at the moment because they 're not playing their players aren 't getting paid the coaches aren 't getting paid and that 's you know the fact is they 've costs of course electricity insurances but overall their costs are minimal some of the clubs are doing things to keep the funds rolling through others have just shut down and it will be a situation that they will reopen but it 's very important the clubs don 't lose viability and don 't lose too much cash in what 's less of this season and if that is the case you know maybe it has to be reviewed if clubs are going to lose money in 2020 then the season doesn 't need to go ahead because no club can afford to lose too much money and maybe they prepare for 2021 I think it 's important for mental health issues to get players out on the track and get them working and get them running and get them together because I think that 's what we play footy for to be a part of a team but in the long term if we can 't have people at the footy as in spectators there 's not much sense playing footy at this level we see at an AFL level they have a big broadcast TV deal that pays the wages and you can understand that from both the AFL 's state and the TV company that are involved but at this level we 're not doing it in that regard because if there 's no one going through the gate we can 't pay our gate you need about two thousand dollars a week to pay for the umpires and all the expenditure so it 's very important that you know if we can 't have crowds at the footie that we don 't lose money and our clubs viable going into the next season Glen 's been a pleasure talking to you I 'm missing being in the broadcast box with you hopefully we can do it all again really soon but thanks for joining us today always a pleasure thank you okay this has been Peter forensic don 't forget to join us for Forenza radio mama each Sunday from 00 a.m. this has been Peter Forenza and Glenn Barden for see GG TV

    "text": "hello and welcome back to QP tea time where we 're very professional and we know what we 're doing and we even have tea cups that are off-site because we 've got a very exciting and very physical interview today in case you 've forgotten I don 't know how you would 've but I 'm Rosie and I am really really excited to be joined by my second guest for QP tea time Dan power Dan welcome thank you so I want to start by fangirling a bit cuz we had a bit of a chat yesterday before coming here and I googled you after that oh my god there 's a legit celebrity living in Geraldton and there 's obviously like a few more people sort of hiding out I 'm gonna find them through this interview process I just I find it astounding that someone as accomplished as you lives in Geraldton and I think this is always a thing like we meet these amazing people and we want to know like why are you here in general how how come you 're in this beautiful main reason that I came home I 'm originally from here yeah but I came home to look after my mom who 's who 's aging and she 's physically her body 's not coping as well as it should be yeah and so I 'm here to be her arms and legs beautiful way of saying that like caring me someone being their arms and legs I 've been working out a lot for the resource oh very nice yeah a little person at dwarf yeah so yes I 'm Phoenix are not working so great yeah well she 's very lucky to have arms and legs as strong as yours yeah well that 's why I joke with her yes I am born and bred here my whole family 's here my extended family 's here yeah my brother is raising a family down in Perth yeah besides that yeah Wow yeah so when you when you 're a kid in Geraldton what was it like so I went to John 's primary school when I was really young and then later on to Nagle yeah and it in the streets until the streetlights came on and then time to go home yeah but yeah it was it was great safe and perfect place to raise children as it is now yeah it 's just wonderful there was it 's great yeah do you think it 's changed a lot since Sirica I think the oceans changed a fair bit but it 's only been changing the way Society has been changing as well I came home and it 's still a quiet safe place but people 's attitudes is is off the common oh we can 't_''_178.569 let the kids play on the roads or anything like that because it 's dangerous and stranger danger might get them and things like that but yeah for me it feels very safe here yeah beautiful I think like so often on social media we see people saying that you know since this horrible place and so it 's really nice you know someone on that you know that it does still feel like that yeah and I mean for someone who 's grown up in a place like Geraldton were here you were here through high school as well through high school I oughta shinned for my university degree at the circus school in year 12 yeah so yeah I did all of my education here and left yeah yeah so we 've kind of like danced around it so far and that 's that 's definitely a pun for when we talk about but we dance around the fact that there are some hula hoops here and there is some more equipment just like off out of the shot but you just mentioned circus so it 's a great segue into that so you you have a bit of that background which we 'll be talking about and when I say a bit of background I obviously mean you 're like a huge celebrity internationally but how did you start like how did you start getting into so I actually started hearing children I 'm dancing it carries petrova Coast dancing are doing acrobatic dance and jazz and tap and all of the styles that she offers yeah she was a great support and still is I still 's been a wonderful inspiration and a great mentor in my life so she actually is the one who guided me onto the path of the circus school at the during year 12 she said there 's an audition she found a tiny little article in the West Australian asking for auditions for the first intake of the three-year bachelor program yeah in Melbourne through Swinburne University right and so yeah that 's what I do you know travelled down to Perth and yeah did that went into the big wide world went into the big wide world was accepted one of only 25 students accepted nation nationally Wow and that 's now these hula-hoops they 're like they 're the center stage so they want to keep moving I really want to get away from us but now they 're ready to they just they 're ready to be like cool add yes yeah I think this is a good time okay I 'll just move the seat back and we can do a little we have so many of these plans I 'm so excited okay so I like never been able to get a whole hoop like even just say my body for more than a second so like what is it like what is it about that what is the movement in your body that gets us so the movement as the hoop goes around your body you push against the hoop wherever the hoop goes yeah so in fast motion it 's kind of hard to see but I 'm actually making little circles with my waist yeah and you 're going the same direction as the hoop yeah and I can take it down I mean I mean like this is very like sub-prime conditions for Wow and so like is this like is this the kind of thing that got you interested in you know you know how did you get interested in circus from dance like is it really closely related yeah well I was an acrobatic dancer so I do know um bling and stretching and contortion and handstands and things yeah as a dancer so it was a really easy Segway so it 's a lot of tumbling and things forward a little bit so you in your 12 you try it out for them sanika and what it 's like a sample the national institute of circus arts right okay and you were in the first full intake yeah so you actually have a bachelor 's degree and what is what is it in so my major was aerial contortion yeah Wow so I hang by two strips of fabric it 's my main specialty um and I was tying myself up and unravel yeah yeah so I 've tumbled down right yeah I have seen that yeah I 've always thought I could never do it more than anything else I I believe that almost anyone can do it yeah if they have the right technique yeah yeah and so like you you start off just as this acrobatic dancer you go to my card to start studying for your bachelor 's degree what are the skills that you develop at naica in order to become a performer I had never done anything aerial and for it to end up being my major yeah and such a huge those three years I studied 40 hours a week when I won with a trainer of four different specialties we were offered you know three of those specialties were aerial based for me and one was contortion on the ground handstands contortion yeah so that was pretty epic yeah on the body yeah so I learnt I learnt a great volume aerial applications in those three years and so outside of the study that you 're doing and you know I mean we probably don 't have hours to explain how you do all that kind of stuff but how do you develop that those that strength and the sort of stamina you need to do that is it part of your study or is it something completely separate no it 's part of the study um getting enough rest and eating well was important yeah I also you know as a student you also have to pay your rent and stuff so I was also working quite a bit I was working two other jobs as well as studying 40 hours so I was only sleeping about four hours work as well so that was kind of a hard time but being young and fresh and yeah you just do it and I look back and I go wow my god I could never do that these days you know I 'd just be like a zombie oh yeah if I get a solid like eight hours sleep don 't talk to me that 's my point 12 I 'm all good you know back then it 's like yeah and sorry like you 're working two jobs and you study in 40 hours a week and I want to ask you a bit about you know how you even managed to find time to audition for circus or a a month doing all of that that was really lucky at university at the time at circus school we were in production for show so we were rehearsing a show that was coming up and audition was on a Saturday so my acrobatic partner and I we decided to audition yeah funnily against the advice of the circus school really because they believed that we weren 't quite ready you 're young and you think we do whatever you want exactly so we just did it just to experience what an audition was like I had no expectations of being accepted at that time I just wanted to know what it would be like to it to audition for a company that large yeah and surprisingly for me we both were accepted for the same role in the same show yeah in Las Vegas and how old were you just just about 21 I was turning 21 that year I wasn 't quite 21 but it seemed like free kid you know they came from Jerry you 're 21 and you 've just sort of you know made your way to Melbourne unit doing all of this have you been overseas I 've never been overseas when I went to Melbourne I 'd never been out of w.a really so that was a big big step for me yeah and then when I was accepted to a slave that was huge because that was going to be from Melbourne to Montreal we lived in Montreal at the headquarters for were shipped to Las Vegas yeah right and that 's where we stayed for three years and so like I mean what did your mum thinking this time uh what she realized what exactly contemporary circus was and what I 'd be doing she was happy but when she first heard you know it 's circus she thought you know ringside and yeah sideshow and that kind of thing yeah no you 're not doing that now no but once she saw that it was more contemporary and yeah and the artwork behind what I was doing then she was very accepting yeah it 's been a great support my whole family has actually yeah and did you like did you find it hard to leave well I mean you 'd already left Geraldton but did you leave Australia I 've put on a brave front I remember I remember going on I 'm fine I 'm fine and then going behind the international screen you know where you have to go yeah yeah say goodbye to everyone you go behind the screen you fill out your declaration of you really real and I was like sobbing doing my thing and this immigration lady came and helped me [Music] having these moments of you know the Qantas ads and things you know flashing through my brain of Australia 's home and all that kind of stuff there yeah yeah it 's quite funny and so how long did you come back during that time all you away the whole time we had a we had a break and a five week break going from Montreal to Las Vegas our theatre wasn 't quite ready yeah for the cast to arrive and they had a like a technical accident the stage had fallen if if you know if the show car so you were in yeah the the sage floats it 's you know great a beast they call it and so it comes up and it pivots and it rotates all in this void basically you know audience looks down into the void well that stage on the side the machine that makes it better up and down had broken in so the whole thing had fallen yeah so that coming rehearse there yeah so um we took five weeks off for now as I would come home you know in that time and sort of come back to children for a a little bit and then go back to Melbourne for a little bit and then fly back out with my partner yes that was good Wow yeah sorry so you you went over to Montreal to train and how long were you in Montreal we were in Montreal about three or three and a half months during the dead of winter Wow so it was minus 40-something degrees at one point and I 'd never seen snow either at that point so when we arrived it was snowing and white and just amazing and I 've never I don 't want to see snow anymore and sorry I mean so you 're in you know in the dead of winter you control for like six months like just how I hear that and I think about what the kind of person I was when I was 21 and I would have probably just like collapsed and like falling great because I embarrassed myself in what I was doing you you live very close to the training center across the road actually so and with all the other artists off all the other shows who are training at that time and people who are going into new roles and people who are injured who are rehabilitating yeah are all in the same place so it 's actually a really great little community and you have these like they do your party nights and all sorts of things inside the accommodation and yeah so it was really really fun was it like a bit of a family exactly a lot of people I guess if you 're all in the same position exactly and you 're living with everyone else in your cast as well so you 've become very close to your cast mates in that time yeah because you 're 24 hours a day with them you know that really creates a bond yeah I can imagine 24 hours a day seven days a week yeah about two months when when my partner and I arrived we were of 80-something right so a lot of them had already been there for nine months and disaster I 'm just trying to pick up yeah so we we were kind of like the late comers yeah yeah and so this show was this the first time the show had been today exactly yeah so we were part of the creation of that show Wow yeah and so you did your training in Montreal did you have any input into the I 'm assuming it 's called choreography yeah yeah for scene is it all choreographed for you how does that work no so we we choreographed the scene working with other actors that are on stage with us and we went through multiple different versions of the act it would change constantly from day in day out maybe two or three times at one point the whole scene would change the whole intention of the scene would change we were working at one point 12 to 15 hours a day warming up calling down warming up cooling down and so when you say that it was this during the shows is before okay this is in Montreal when yeah everything 's being created yeah and then once we got to Las Vegas it was pretty set yeah at least the intention of the scene had been set but the choreography on the stage of where we went and what we did on stage was fluid yeah and it stays fluid yeah to ward off boredom yeah the scenes are constantly evolving yeah either be funnier or less funny or and I guess like any performer knows it when you 've got an audience but some audiences react differently to something exactly you play off that as well exactly yeah and just different different things for the artists themselves yeah my acrobatic partner and I because we played two roles crabs in contortion poses we were in a backbend yeah and the puppet that we were wearing the way that we moved would manipulate how the how the crab would react yeah so for to do that we we found that by talking or singing it it helped us to breathe so we were talking to each other at one point 'm a little saying crap as we popped up out of the sand and they 're not here my partner go how many was Hank read about her part in the music and then we 're both like hop onto each other and yeah continue to play the role yeah so it 's my it 's a big show and you 're like you at the MGM grand grand yeah so it 's like it 's not just you know yeah it 's I mean keep you taste beautiful but it 's not you know a little cutie kind of thing is yeah it 's a huge theater but you can still have fun with it Oh totally we did get in trouble a little bit when we got a bit carried away and the node at the end of the day was the crowd to keep it down a little bit because the first three rows can hear you and that was being a bit bad because we 're talking about what we would do later that night and we would go and things but exactly exactly so they no it really helps us breathe so other otherwise we forget to breathe and yeah you don 't want to passed out crab that was and for how long were you in Vegas so I was in Vegas for almost three years I did 970 shows in a row in a row in a row yeah so that was quite amazing unfortunately my partner had to come home a year earlier than me she couldn 't she didn 't like Vegas very much so she came home and waited until I came back yeah and then and then we resumed our career together yeah and like in in Vegas where did you leave so you live in a hotel no not actually lots of people ask us that even when we were in Vegas people go oh so what were you in but no we we lived near the strip but not on it yeah in a apartment complex yeah with a few other of our classmates now about 20 of us yeah went into the same complex in twos yeah it 's a bit of a weird place Vegas point we were about 20 minute walk away from the strip and you could still feel the buzz of the neon like and the radiation from the strip yes kind of bizarre yeah and then after my partner had left I moved about 20-minute drive away now by the so Las Vegas is in a valley yep so I lived just on the border of the hills yeah so with a performer from oh yeah so there 's more than one show on it at the same time yeah so though at that point there was about four or five different sector select shows in Las Vegas Wow and so not only a you part of your your cast but there 's other costs that you interact with so it was um it was a really great extended family yeah I suppose the scale but the scale of something like that in Vegas four or five shows you just don 't get that here in Australia do you no no not at all and we 're all playing two shows a night five nights away Wow to our our audience our auditorium doing that twice twice a night five nights way you think about the volume yeah constantly selling out yeah off people you I don 't even know how many people wish I did my shows too so what you 're saying is that millions of people have heard you say I 'm a little sand crab baby probably did that crab just yeah so you came back to Australia after three years 970 show and where did you go from there so I came home and I came back to children actually straight asked my contract and recovered yeah because I was quite tired and the body was exhausted I came home and just rested for about a month I think yep at that point I think and then I went back to Melbourne where my acrobatic partner was waiting and we resumed training together and living together and rekindling the bond and then I started teaching at NACA yeah so where you 'd studied yourself where I 'd studied I started teaching just casually yeah at first and then I took some time to go to Canberra entertain not for a holiday she did a lot of cruise contracts yeah as an aerialist and in that time either I would say in our apartment and hold down foot or when I went away she would hold down the apartment so on and so forth yeah but mostly we were together in Melbourne yeah so I went to Canberra and danced okay in ballet and contemporary at a dance and aerial studio just I just go do a bit of ballet my yeah basically full-time living in my my choreographer so that was kind of interesting yeah yeah maybe a bit different all quite very different very different and it really pushed me to come back to the circus yeah yeah sometimes you need that reminder of the things that you love exactly not doing them yeah yeah so I love dance circus is where my heart and soul is yeah yeah so you talked a little bit about your partner well you talked quite a lot about your partner so what letting you talk about the bond that you had I 'm just a real novice when do you talk so much about that is it like a kind of a lifelong thing that period it is in Korean away yeah we we did an aerial act so our lives are basically held in each other 's hands at that point so it 's it is it 's quite a interesting bond you gain over over time and we worked together for about eleven years so yeah it was quite a long long stint and we 've competed internationally and done a lot of lot of festivals and things no yeah we gained a lot of acclaim yeah together so she was a big part of my career so it 's hard not to talk about yeah yeah and so you you did eventually leave Canberra in Melbourne and then came back here to Geraldton yeah and so how long have you been back here now so I 've been back just on four years coming up I think yeah yeah what kind of change after 13 Canberra I went back to Melbourne and worked full-time then yeah in the bachelor program teaching and that was very welfare while at the same time pushing them to be the best that they possibly could be yep and I created some very very strong aerialists in that time and unique apparatus and things like that people who had never seen students doing and things so I 'd worked very hard to get some really great students pumped out of NACA so that was really great and then I came home and I didn 't realise how actually stressed I was yeah once I got back here and just kind of went oh it 's all good you know I 'm home and I 'm home safe and we be and it 's and it 's warm yeah and it 's when it 's windy it stays windy it doesn 't suddenly decide it wants to be sunny and stop and then suddenly decide to be rainy and like movin definitely for where there 's in four seasons in one day yeah whereas here it 's pretty good yeah you know all the time for about the first six months I was always saying everyday to my mum Oh such you come back in you 're like oh why did I ever leave exactly and the beaches the beach is so pristine and so nice yeah yeah so you 've been back here for years now yeah and we 're like where have you what have you been doing with circuses since you 've been back so I 've been working at the PCYC building the circus classes up there yeah and that 's been going well we 've it 's we 've been slowly building and we 're getting to a point where we we kind of want to expand a bit more yeah change change it up a bit and get out into the local community a bit more and do some more interesting things within the Delton community and beyond yes so say you 'll pitch to us yeah exactly yeah we offer a wide variety of acrobat of activities yeah but mainly I 'm an aerialist so it 's aerial focused yep yeah I mean I 'd love to talk to you for hours but we probably should try and end it at some point yes plan what the circus culture in Geraldton would look like in five years what would it look like in five years I would love to expand to have our own space our own building that offer community-based activities and classes for all age ranges and and and skill levels possibly as a feeder into Nikes courses maybe yeah to be viable financially and and socially viable so you want to stay in I want to say you know and then once you 've got the circus culture going you can 't leave exactly yeah yeah sorry Melvin sorry thank you so much you for having me I think we have maybe one more oh yeah yeah I 've got my handstand problem I yeah yeah I didn 't mark earlier that I probably wouldn 't even be able to stand on this and I and I stand by that so I 've got a little handstand prop here I 'll just do a little elbow plants so I put my elbow into my hip yeah that looks really easy I think I could do that oh look one hand and it that 's my question that was that 's basically a first year skill yeah maybe it took me about six months of first year training to sort of get the idea of that balance well when you start offering your classes I will be your first unit great thank you very much _"

on top of the stove yeah and you say pizza is about 18 minutes you do you mix it in there and you cook it in there wow and that 's everything i think if you had cooked me a pizza i probably also would

but it was probably a bit nice to go no i didn 't like it is it because you prefer the cat [Laughter] last time i went to was 2008 yeah and um i come home five weeks early i pay my trip back again to us because i was i don 't know if i was homesick every time i ring my son how you going john i could start crying on the phone and i just i don 't know if it was homesick or i couldn 't my italian food didn 't agree with me anymore i don 't know i don 't know were a kid in italy did you did you think i 'm going to leave here one day did you always think that or no it was just when your sister left no one my sister left yeah because we were very close yeah yeah very very close and so once she left that she break my heart i wanted to be with her all the time because she 's she was a dressmaker and i was learning a little bit of her and i was helping there a lot and i was always with her so why did she come to australia she come with my hunty because my auntie said she had a husband here okay she says well we go and see my husband and then we stay a few months and then i come back unfortunately she comes in australia and stay in australia it 's a long way to go yeah it 's a couple months it 's not you don 't just hop back on the boat and go home do you yeah and so then my sister says you know if you want course i want to come i want to see i want to be where you are yeah definitely did you see any similarities where um between the culture here and the culture that you grew up with in italy well where i grew up a very plain things my mother was very restricted the girls are not allowed to do anything but once you come to five years of school when you get 10 years old you 're not going to school anymore because you 're going to stay at home and help a mom so gosh my other my first daughter 's sister she learned to show it because she chose there now the sister learned to broad the work my other one got married and so and i was at the the last girl so i couldn 't um my mother didn 't want to send me anyway so she says no marie gonna stay home and and and look after the kids and was it at that point that you learnt to cook like where did you yes i was well i was 11 i think it to the market and i look at the time and i knew my father was coming home and i said because he was the type of one arrived at home he wants to have a rest have a glass of wine and a plate on a table and i said mama 's not home yet i said to my brother i says mama 's not home yet and that is coming what are we gonna do so i claim because i was my mother had a beautiful stove electric and gas so i climb on a table wow i got a little pot and i put i used to look at mama what they were doing so i put water and i got i 've got a smack that day from mum or dad mommy was scared to find you climbing on the stuff i guess i was i was still little yeah and i climb on the table and pick up the pot and pick up the water and pick up the oil and so i was looking mom and i made pasta for jolly that night what 's my father came home the thing was ready my mother was not home yet and because she i don 't know why she was elected to the went to the market and that day or come in and i says and my father one walks in they can smell the food and i says where 's your mother oh she 's over there she 's coming so i didn 't drop that but my mother when she walks in she had bags in there and my father realized that she looked at me and he said to me says you lied to me i said but the food 's ready it will cook that mama says no i didn 't_''_1976.399 i didn 't cook however i haven 't done anything yet he says well i won 't be long i 'll cook it i said who 's that stuff is the star wars food a lot of stuff mum walk in the kitchen i saw the food who cooked that said mama i did but that daddy wants it to eat when it comes up so we would just wow in trouble because my father was too worried that i put a burden on myself yeah yeah of course and he locked myself in the car in the broomer cover i bet he still ate your delicious you know i 'll never day but as you said to me says you 're done now the food is good but don 't do it anymore not again you know you 're too little i was not even a nine years old yeah that 's amazing and um and i said okay and not right but after that was okay so did you it sounds like even from a young age you learn to work hard from a young age i had done i was 10 years old when i was washing by hand carried the water my mama house was there and the water we had to carry the water from say well where the kiwi that queen elizabeth center is there i had to go run down there we had the tap there everybody could go and get the water like two two bucket water one in my head and oh my gosh some water i used to have a bucket to like you know like the really one put in my head and dragged water and when i fill up with the big tank and within that because everybody sort of doing them was about 10 or 12 people family in that reunion like you 're going to units here and then everybody 's there but over there and then we had the one just one and that and it was really big and i used to go there and wash all by hand wow and then i used to climb on the hill to put the rope from one one tree to another to hang at the clothes so i had a you know it was very poor we were all poor there so i i want to ask you about this house that you that you helped build because it sounds like you know you were only 10 when you were cutting water and washing by hand and cooking for your dad did so this house that you built and

block it looks like it wouldn 't happen today i 've got to play with that i 'll come across the other night it 's um the block cost about 22 000. wow somewhere so this would have been what in the early 90s no no 89 89 at the then you 're gonna build a house now build a house somewhere i think it 's just amazing that you know you were working so hard you have four kids yeah yeah they must have not been that old yet no it was um how i don 't know how did you do it that 's what i wanted how did you do this what do you mean like how are you not so tired or no i don 't know everybody was surprised and how strong i was and and so actually some people say are you on drugs or something [Laughter] because they couldn 't imagine working so hard yeah no and i don 't know i just did it and so challenger bank and laundered the money and i start go around with the bill building company it was wasn 't that leather so how long did it take to to build this house i mean i don 't even know how long it takes these days to build a house yeah oh it didn 't take much long a year no no a couple months ago the house we 've got to find it we 've got to find it the house are you looking for this one here this one that 's this all right we got the picture that 's all the people donating me the stuff you 've got to show this to the camera so everyone can say to the camera you can hold that up so i went around the building company i got the bricklayers couple of guys doing the bricklayer which are the fighters over there yeah i went to all of the other people here and then they all donate me the some some of the stuff i had to pay for it but the brick the building company get all the cupboards and um yeah that 's um and i had the builder mario pirona he 's he helped me to to organize it and um so i just went ahead wow no big deal no more so a couple months six months to build it probably yeah wow that was probably the data there somewhere and um and so they sold it for charity they still a hundred and i sold it for 155 000. oh my god that 's awesome that 's yeah and that 's right yeah and that 's all right yeah i went when i finished when i sold the house i went and paid challenge bank them and that 's it so is the house still there do you know yeah the house is still there really of course wow well we don 't have to give away the address but maybe if you 're in mount tarkou like your house might have been built by maria and all my mom in the way the houses right in the corner yeah yeah wow that 's great so so after that we might sort of fast forward a little bit because i 'm just a bit shocked like this is just amazing one thing after the other i 'm kind of like on the edge of my seat just like okay um yeah you know so if we go through a little bit from you

    "text": "hi everyone I 'm Kath I 'm public health nutritionist working at Food Bank WI in Geraldton and today we 'll be doing some demo cooking with our special chef Shane so today we 're going to be cooking from our recipe book we have the food sensation for adults recipe book that we develop in Perth funded by the Department of Health and today we 'll be cooking the beef stroganoff so it 's on page 36 so you will need some rump steak that I have previously cut you 'll need some peace some onions spinach mushroom and some flavors with the Dijon mustard and the pepper so we 'll get on going I 'll heat the pan quite high and then maybe Shane would you like to grate the carrots please me well I 'm going to be cooking the beef that 's coming along this one nice shot right of it in the kitchen I need to make sure I finish this with all my fingers still intact so what 's your favorite veggies big broccoli Finn oh definitely cooked crunchy can 't_``_93.72 go wrong but 've just above that yeah it 's a fun guy so we 'll have a lot of mushroom we 'll have a carrot in there so we have lots of veggies and that 's drogon on and one point is to make sure that we do have our five a day five days a day to keep it healthy have you tried to rob broccoli before yeah look I can 't_''_122.7 say I 'm a big fan of many raw vegetables at all to be honest so yeah I do like them cook though yes roasted broccoli steamed broccoli broccoli and steer fries but it does have to be kept crunchy but okay now raw probably not so much my thing thing do you grow it now we cut our try growing broccoli little broccoli knees yeah but I keep going to seed whenever I try and grow them here in Geraldton so I haven 't had much success in it and when you couldn 't buy broccoli for a couple of bucks a bunch sometimes yeah but going to grow doesn 't quite pay up they 've been quite kilo so they 've gone home maybe I 'll get back to growing them yeah maybe you can even have a stone in front of their house my house backs onto Charlie paralyzed I don 't and fruits and veg store so I 'm working on my veggie garden at home I can look across the road and see vegetables for one or two dollars a bag and I 'm kind of thinking geez I 'm putting a lot of work into this for not a lot of economic return but it still gives you that satisfaction of growing them at home exactly yeah do you grow anything else a lot of basil a lot of chilli parsley yeah sage you know at the moment we 've got some leaks coming up in the vegetable garden leak so it 's matters you can 't go wrong with slots and spring onions they grow very very well here in the middle of Geraldton yeah good one capsicum at the moment certainly growing nice and strong going on at the moment so a bit of a green thumb oh oh we like one of the things I wish I wasn 't so good at growing was coriander I know my my fiancee Tami Rose loves growing coriander much tamiya somewhat discussed but that 's alright we 'll be along with it it 's hard to grow in summer but beautiful in winter are fines coming along really too well for my liking at the moment with a little bit struggle with mint we 'd like that rosemary goes goes all year-round you can 't go wrong that 's very strong so what i 'm doing here i 'm just gonna try up my veggies and add my meat back in here Oh grab the carrot that 's great thank you for doing that and maybe if you can just have a look which step we 're up to in the recipe books at the moment we go there I mean that we added our garlic garlic was with the onion that was already inside with our own industry that 's fantastic with a mushroom so soon enough we 've got our beef going that 's all looking pretty good so once you tablespoons of each two tablespoons of Dijon yes step aside we 're maintaining our social distancing that 's because I couldn 't quite get the spoonful there I 've used three but that 's okay don 't get me to tell you I think we 'll be fine with that never have too much mustard mustard is beautiful isn 't it you can put and do we need to add some other veggies today we just about right here now if we wish to we give it a bit of a stir and it 's probably time then to once it 's all stirred through pop the lid on about five minutes have you done that sort of recipe before shame no I certainly have to be guilty here I normally get the beef stroganoff packet mixes and just throw it together but again having fiance Timmy being a chef by trade I have to admit my job tends to involve pretty much what I 've just done there plug it I 'll get to great I get to measure the odd thing and I 'll get out of the great and by doing it at home you cut back a lot on your fat and salt intake so in the commercial foods you often get a lot of salt put in there as preservatives yeah guys I hear that a lot yeah particularly in from Sam one of the things I learned in particularly prepared foods is the amount of sugar that restaurants and and packaged food Jesus how did sugar salt add some more salt and add some more sugar and eventually you end up with a you know a very high high energy dense food so I know when we cook at home with Tammy it 's all very much there 's no sugar is much less salt and it comes out just as delicious not more exactly and you use your chilies from the garden you use your rosemary and all these flavors that will really bring the food yeah we cook the rice the other night using has some Grenaa flame that we swapped for some crayfish okay so we love using our own food our own vegetables their own meat yeah and all that access to ingredients here in the Midwest so very exciting thing to be doing and being part of here on Geoghan TV yeah no it 's great thank you very much for for that having you know us to here cooking on CGG TV and definitely these recipes are so easy full of veggies as I said trying to get people to increase their veggie intake take their salt sugar intake we have our plight have you seen that plight before shine so it 's to encourage people to have more veggies so therefore the portion size is already set Oh your veggies yep you have all your veggies in your plate and when you attend our food sensation you get a veggie well replied for free so that 's a really good way to to get that so should I get perhaps going with a little bit of cornflour for that next step well yeah well you 're there and I think we 'll have to add the water as well yeah one cup of water yep I have that here and you need your corn flour yeah see it smells fantastic it 's so good in here okay I think we 'll beat about right and I might put a little bit of pepper right away so we don 't forget and we can always add more in our play because that 's going to be lunch right filming this at lunch time too so really done well there try to I get the timing right okay so that 's good you can put snow we need to add our corn flour and water mix to the frying pan yeah and that 's gonna pick it up perfect so corn flour will act as the Ticknor makes the sauce nice and yeah we better add some yogurt to that as well we will in a second and we 'll have our peas and spinach so I might put the peas in the spinach now and then add the yogurt at the end because if you add the yogurt when it 's too hot it 's kind of curds okay yeah bit and doesn 't give the smooth look that 's your after you know just as well you you know okay so I had frozen veggies there frozen veggies are another great way to have a back-up plan if you 're running out of fresh veggies have your frozen veggies sometimes they 're a bit cheaper as well because some some veggies may not be in season but the frozen veggies are always there and can we expect another community garden at some point in Geraldton I 've been to the Mitchell one is really good we were talking about that before the show at the moment the Mitchell Street garden out there in Spalding is really starting to take shape yeah we know Stan Malley has his little community garden out there on Fitzgerald Street and that wonderful one out there at beach lanes as well so there isn 't at the moment he plans for the additional community gardens but we are always looking to hear from the community what they might like to see in this space because it 's a great way to decrease your cost as well knowing that in the region the cost of veggies is really more expensive than in metropolitan veggies having community garden neighborhood or things like that 's probably a good way to you way to get people together you know you bring the community together yeah even gets to enjoy the fruits of their labor but when it comes to those vegetables so hopefully in soon we 'll see all that coming ahead that 's great even more even more guards like you wanted yeah yeah I 'd be just in heaven that 'd be great yeah all right let 's put that yogurt I 'll put that down a bit that goes for a cup yeah so I 'm gonna using a half measuring cup because I just can 't quite fit it all in there so be two half cups well I could 've just tipped it straight out of the container there I reckon if I had to thought about that before oh that 's all right that 's gonna be really yogurt I like that perfect what do you reckon about that here once you stir that through it 's looking pretty delicious but at the moment yes in a good way I sprinkle on top when you serve it serve it with little pasta shell or a bit of mashed potato that can be quite nice or raw potato can be quite nice on the side as well okay a little bit of extra pepper in there a bit of pepper at the moment I 've put a little bit in but I think you know it 's up to you to add a little bit more in your play one some do you like it spicy spicy yeah I hope you add some Chilean chili yep the garden okay so I think we should be ready now to probably dish it out soon and we 'll see how it goes I had cut the beef quite small so it should be all good oops sorry for the aesthetic and because I don 't have fresh parsley you know I 'm missing out here on the final touch but I reckon fresh parsley on that and you would have a really nice little dish for lunch or you can have it in a plate if you want or in your portion plate little side salad or some potatoes so that 's it for now for our cooking to die thank you so much Shyne for being with us cooking with us and entertaining us on your gardening skills and from me and the food bank team thank you very very much stay safe stay connected stay healthy and we 'll see you next time thank you delicious thank you very much _"

    "text": "welcome to CJD TV my name is Lex and I 'm really excited to be bringing you a fresh segment of qpt time we have a very special guest today and amazing I call musical prodigy trim elevates welcome to our our show this is not usually a thing but it would be really great to get to know you and here 's some of your tunes as well remember that start with your younger years did you grow up near Geraldton or a regional country w-a well we are Dilton you know mom and dad a Chilton sort of back to the start of jelton yep their families go back but dad had a travel bug and left with mum was pregnant I had actually had Alison here and then moved to Brisbane and my twin and I and my brother were born there but we came back at 18 months old and pretty well born and bred yeah living around here or did you you know did you grow up in the early days we did go to Paris for a couple of years in the seventies early just paddocks and when we came back from Perth in the mid seventies we were in Mitchell Street but then out on farms that 's how I grew up as a teenager on farms working on farms and let it walk away yeah so you 've really seen I guess the town the surround that 's not the same place yeah it 's changed so much yeah if you could wind back the clock I mean back to the 70s growing up what sort of music was happening around that time it would have been a mix of really rich uprising kind of music and radio or like what you know Kozeny you saw the Eagles or dc or someone like that but you know commercialized situation is a is a sort of tunnel of music of simple sellable product and I 've never been you know I take it a bit more seriously than that so I had to sort of find it through my my older sister and her boyfriends would be a bit older and they grew up on you know late 60s early 70s that 's sadly even is a kid in the seventies you know this sort of commercialized funnel of music he 's there on the radio and on TV you don 't hear the the outer side stuff which is a richer so going through your I guess record collection or your sister 's a record collection what was some of the kind of artists that you would be coming across or did you know acadec and things like that but you know lynyrd skynyrd robin trower jimi hendrix of course Led Zeppelin Jojo cow Eric Clapton Roy Buchanan huge huge love and passion of my life Roy cooter you know there 's great syncopated rhythm bands like little feet and all the funk music of the 70 's and the 60s but you had it all there you had the whole lot there you had funk you had rock he had blues you had metal you had you know classical piece was in the charts in 1970 called classical gas you know like where would we hear that today yeah music that you had around yeah and I was lucky you know heard a bit of it yeah just would have been amazing to put some vinyl on and have that in your living room that 's right and also potentially to go and see gigs you know I was I finished high school 70 and it was straight out farm 15 I was working 80 hours a week on a farm you know so I never got that opportunity because I didn 't have more and my license but I could you know I correct collected the records yeah and that 's how I got you know I had my music there in my room any way I could do it yeah definitely I remember you telling me a story of when you were working this long you know 12-hour shifts on the farm but you had this real passion ignited inside of you to to play music and continue with music what are those days look like I mean you 'd be working and then would you just spend four cbh which was covering all the you know the wheat bulkheads and you know we 'd do a 12-hour day of no dad and then the boys that would come back to the bus because we were you know we had to do several bulkheads so we had a bus that we used to live in and travel in a truck for the tarp and we 'd go you know and then you 'd alternate cooking so you know someone to go back and cook tea and then you go back in empty that all go to bed I 'd go up onto the top of the wheat stack with my guitar for two hours before I went to bed because exactly what you you say it 's it 's love it 's ultimate passion and love for it that makes you do that yeah you know and that used to frustrate me because I could only do two hours you know I wanted to do ten yeah you know but yeah you know if you genuinely loved something you you you 're gonna find a way yeah your sacrifice you don 't sacrifice it for everything in your life you sacrifice your life for eat yeah yeah then you person in the world but if the work isn 't there it doesn 't matter going to that though I mean you have dedicated decades of your life not all guitar be you know guitar was the love when I first found music but I wanted to be a writer and I think at ours we all tend to be a bit enthralled with ourselves I wanted more I want to construct the whole thing I want to write I don 't want to write a bass line as a guitarist I want to understand how the base is applauded and write it as a bass player you know the keyboard parts I don 't want to write it as a guitarist I want to write it as a keyboard players drums you know you think you know what a groove is until you get on a drum kit and learn to play properly and then you do you know you understand how all the mechanics work and how to get a decent grooving and I think you know as a writer that 's probably the most important thing is and not just you definitely so you 've spent time on guitar drums bass banjo in a bitty keyboard yeah but you know I 'll never play it in public just I understand how to put but you know years ago I learned a technique it 's called piano technique which by CUDA is you know he 's the man that sort of brought that forward with playing and it 's like a chord voicing every keyboard so you apply it to your chords and that was always there in my playing so that probably made writing keyboard play parts a little bit easier yeah and with your with your songwriting you 're really passionate about learning the mechanics but also the theory around music I do there 's not enough to learn off off pop musicians you know popular musicians they don 't know anything so you got it educate yourself the most important thing I think for any musician if they want to be creative if they want to learn by ear you know if they want write songs whatever they want to do is the modes and music so that allows you to know where everything is on the footboard and not just stayed in here with a couple of chords you 've got the whole system then you can work on chord building melodies harmonies yeah I don 't like soloing whatever you want to do you 've got the whole so yeah I believe that doesn 't matter what you do whether you 're laying bricks or playing guitar the more you know the better you 're going to do at it yeah as simple as that teacher knowledge is everything yes but then you know there 's the trap I think of knowledge being too much the part of what you do well yeah you know where you 're thinking about what you 're brought in in arranging rather than feeling it so the go is that you learn as much as you can and I 'm still learning stickers the day I started because the more you learn the more you see there is to learn deeper in you go but yeah when you know as you learn it forget about it it it 's there so forget about it and when you 're being creative never think about it all those things that you 've learnt technically and theoretically are all in there and it 's just so making the choice of what it wants to bring out yeah not this thing yeah definitely with that being said I think we 'd like to hear one of your tunes that 's come to that time what have you got for us that 's called unfold [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] not bad I mean that 's beautiful and you can hear there are lots of different influences around it so I mean you mentioned before a bit about the music that you we 're listening to as a kid has that kind of had an influence yeah you know I think later in life even more you know I was lucky because I think in popular music that was the most creative time ever was 65 to 75 where the quality was just in the diversity and then by the end of the seventies I didn 't pick up a guitar until had hit the scene and we you know I got onto Steve Morse and invited hit the scene Yngwie Malmsteen Steve via Joe Satriani so you know when I picked up a guitar it was an enthralling world to be when when guitarists could do what they could do and it was technically based it wasn 't you know well awareness a couple Accords and I go you know you had to do what they did yeah so train technically scale speed picking flat picking rate picking all this sort of stuff and it was inspirational because there wasn 't just that aspect of virtuoso playing the knowledge that went into doing it so the learning that you had to do technically and theoretically to play like that and yeah that was that was the dedication for the 10 year block I had a good teacher who sort of taught me a lot to start out with who didn 't charge me actually he did it for nothing but he was a very good guitarist technically and so there was a lot of good information that come from him a he 's you know inspiration as well and but at the end of you know 12 years of falling in love with a metronome which you know you got to do and lost the song lost my soul you know but thank God I had that stuff I 'll listen to when I was before I play the guitar and I find myself now right back there with all this great feel and all this you know each guitarist has their own tone like if you hear Clapton and then you hear Roy Buchanan the they 're totally different you know they play totally differently they sound totally different so that you know I 'm right back to that being my passion I still you know write some crazy sort of metal guitar instrumentals and that but it 's not the priority as it used to be the souls the main thing I think that 's amazing I think that 's a really great point to bring up especially where we were at with music now it 's easy to look at the music scene the modern day music scene mean what are you thinking about that solemn music product money product you know being a teacher for nearly 30 years you know I remember when I first started out a kid came into me at 13 or 14 and I said oh that 's cool you know what do you want to play guitar us it sounds awesome I love the sound of it you know I love when you play that you get that sound and when you get that now it 's like oh well that 's cool you want to play drums or yeah I wanna get on TV famous so I guess saying that why is it so important to bring soul into the music again because it 's real you know all this artificial deep candy it 's more image it 's more and in the record companies you know music is not a product it is a soul of a human being you can only write a great song if you 've lived every single word and every single melody in that song that 's the song yeah a song ain 't_:_1002.5 some _._1007.899 that 's not you know it 's product it 's product and a young kid you know today wants to leave the image of that product it 's not real it 's not real it 's got to come back to the roots in it that 's what I found myself doing man like I 'm you know I pulled out a judge like I out album I can 't pull out us a tree album anymore listen to it but I 'll go back and I 'll pull out a judge that Kyle or a little feet to Roby cannon or rock it or yeah you know a ZZ Top yeah you know pull that and I 'll still still get that excitement out of when I first heard it a bit you can hear more than you could initially that going back and listening to their songs again it 's like yeah whoa I 'm really starting to unravel the lives of this song you don 't know what you 're hearing when you understand you know you don 't you literally don 't you know if someone fourth bar scary but I think if most people knew what they were listening to you they wouldn 't be wouldn 't be buying it but yeah you know as you learn more about composing you know more knowledge about you know how instruments play in creating chains and whatever you 're able to break down every single thing that you 're listening to yeah so I go back as a more as a knowledgeable musician and I listen to the stuff that I grew up on and I 'm just glad that that 's you some of it was pretty good for modern-day musicians we 're running out of time but I really want to get this in where can we start we want to hear more diverse rich music who can we look to what should we be looking for on YouTube you know to really get into every star diversify alright I want to be a metalhead alright I want to be a blues man alright I want to be you know a country guy that 's not enough because it 's plain flogged within 10 million diversify yeah you know funk jazz classical you know classical 's the ultimate form for maladies and structure and rhythms and anything everything that you want to hear an arrangement classical has you know blues reggae Latin you know for rhythm and percussion african cuban you know all these difference even country has things in it that no other style has yeah you know so I always say diversify okay if you might have your slot of what you want to do you know you might want to be a focusing or you might be want to want to be a country singer or whatever or guitarist but add something fresh to it you 're not gonna get that from where you are and listen yes yeah go somewhere else to find something and take back to what you you want to do then it 's uniquely yours and year listening what you listen to is what you are so for listening to three chords in 4 or the rest of my life and I want to be a musician I start one plus one the one name that probably Rodriguez who had two great albums had the worst management and the worst record label known to men and they duked him I thank God he made those two albums if you 're looking for lyrical depth they are the probably the two best albums to ever get your hands on okay and all right that is all we 've got time for I mean Trevor Miller which has written hundreds how many songs have you written to date got 800 but they 're not you know there 's classical you know it 's not just all three chords no far from it it really diverse across lots of different genres no yeah really unfortunate no techno there oh well it 's a trio so much he 's gonna finish this segment with a song to fade us out but thank you so much for listening to qpt time we 've enjoyed having a tattoo Trevor Miller which this is final song which is called spirit the spirit Mara [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] drew a little bit to everybody probably worth noting just quickly is relieved that Trevor is his own terms so hopefully you 'll see so good stuff and be able to buy his his tunes and access some of his amazing music thank you so much this is qpt time as part of CDG TV with love chatting to you and hopefully we 'll catch you soon _"

    "text": "hello and good morning to sit GG TV so this morning we 're going to have a bit of a yoga session with you so I 'm CAF and I 'm part of the Geraldton yoga club and we 're very happy to bring that session to you we are with CGG offering a free session of your guide to the community every Wednesday afternoon at the moment because of the social distancing and the cove aid we 're doing it online so if you 're interested in that jump onto our page we 're on Facebook so Geraldton yoga Club and it 's live on there every Wednesday from 30 to 30 usually we try to go live a bit earlier just to leave you a bit of time to get ready and this is Talia who is going to demonstrate today for us so Talia is my daughter so we part of the same family and we live together so we don 't have to apply the social distancing and it 's really helping to have someone who can support you in certain of the posture we are you can play with that would be very helpful also we don 't have any wall here today but most of the posture we 're going to show you are going to be much easier and safer with the wall because we are all today going to the inversion so there 's two main posture which are the king and the queen of inversion in yoga which are handstand and headstand and these are the hardest postures so it 's really good to be guided by someone or to have someone who knows how to do them to help you to get into those postures so I don 't really want to encourage anyone to try at home without any supervision or any help but we 're going to see that they 're much more different semi inverted posture which are a great way to gain the benefits of inversion without doing those really full-on posture so we 're going to do that to you with Talia today but first of all I just wanted to go through a few benefits of invert so what we call an inversion are knee your head is below your heart so your heart is higher than your head usually we 're in sitting or standing our head is higher than our heart and inverting that process is really helping in many ways our body and interestingly as a child usually they like to do that very natural for them to do handstand they find it cliff all it 's very energetic and it 's really challenging at the same time and I think a lot of adults would say oh yes I could do that when I was a child but now I 'm older I 'm completely out of practice and I can 't do that and one of the benefits of doing inversion is to go against that fear and the main fear of inversion is 4 which is a real fear you know like I 'm not I 'm not saying about anything the advantage of doing inversion is to challenge yourself and you to build that confidence that you can go beyond that fear of falling for the mood it 's a great booster of mood and it improved we 're standing and we 're in that posture and when we 're inverting is doing the the contrary it 's bringing all the blood from our feet to our brain and brings more oxygen to our brain which is a great thing to do it also helps to boost the immune system which in this time and especially with winter coming and the flu season is a great advantage it 's also helping circulation so I mentioned that and it calmed the mind and that 's a great way especially at the end of your day work to really settle back and come and maybe we can start with our first posture today which is a really easy posture to do and there 's not really any contradiction to you to do it so we just lay down on the mat it 's great to have a match just purely for comfort but if you don 't have one you can also have a blanket or just use your carpet and have you Han trying to face app just in that openness so we 're going to focus on and our collar bone being really open forward and then we 're going to lift our leg so you can imagine that 's I 'm a wall and you 're just having your leg at the wall that 's why it 's called like that so this is the first version and you might find you don 't have flexibility in the back of your legs and you can have a slight Bend of your knees which is much easier another way which is still an inversion is to have a bit of an angle so not trying to have that 90 degree angle between your body and your legs but just to have their legs a bit more forward like that so that 's also is a bit easier some people also like to put something underneath the hips just to make it a bit higher so we can use the blanket and fold it and it just means that the hips are a bit higher and give a bit of relief to your lower back especially so again you 're against the wall yeah you 're not so the the wall is supporting your legs so it doesn 't mean you have to make any effort for for doing that great thank you tauriel so this is really the most easiest inversion you can do and I really encourage you to do that every time you retired you know like your legs are tired maybe you 've been standing for a while or you 've been shopping or you just have done a lot of thing on your legs and that has got an amazing effect on turning the mind great now we 're going to move to maybe our do muck asana so that 's dann wird dog which is a very well known posture in yoga so we start maybe on our knees and in a tabletop position all right so we 're trying to have our hands and our shoulders our knees and our hips and the knees are a bit white you know like the hips and the feet as well keeping that distance and then you can move your hands slightly forward usually we do we say one hand forward but even just perfect then you check your toes lifting your hips towards the ceiling great so I can see our stance is a bit too wide so move your your feet slightly forward great and then bend your knees quite a lot and when you bend your knees it allows you to push and usually it 's that part of the body your lower back middle back that you need to push forward and in that posture we 're trying to move the chest so say she 's very flexible obviously so you don 't have to go into the full posture but as you can see your head is going to be lower than your heart again so you have that benefits of the blood circulation and coming back to the head so holding the posture in inversion obviously you will get more benefits but depending on your level you can hold just for a few breath to five minutes ten minutes some yoga stay in inversion for a really long time great do you want to come out it 's good after an inversion to stay in balasana which is resting pose you can also use a block under your forehead so your head is not lower than your heart and slowly your blood circulation is going to come back to normal before jumping up back up so I really encourage you after any inversion to have a pose into a resting posture great thank you Talia now we 're going to see a different kind of inversion with a wide legged inversion so there 's two different stage of that posture the first part is quite easy and more accessible to most people and the second part is more for advanced yogi so you can follow the first part so we 're going to have our legs apart maybe four to six feet apart depending on the length of your legs as well and your flexibility of your inner thigh and we 're going to slightly move our feet inwards just a slight angle and you will feel the difference in your lower back and your sitting bones when you 're doing that slight inwards movements what do you I wanted to say I don 't okay so there and heels of the feet along the yoga mat and that 's a great idea because that makes sure that your body is going to be aligned so when you 're standing there just make sure you 're feeling stable before starting engaging your core so bring in your belly button towards your spine slightly and making sure your shoulders are open and we want to keep that openness in the front of the body so our shoulder blades are really working together and coming together in a back flat so now we 're going to interlace the fingers in the back so I 'm going to show you maybe like that see we 're trying not to have our hands open palms of the ends together and we 're making sure we 're not renting our shoulders but opening our shoulders and opening our collarbones so we take a breath in make our spine long bring our chest forward and we 're going to maintain our back as straight as we can so depending again on the flexibility in the back of your legs and you 're going to back because inversion is also great for strengthening the back of the body and the core so when you 're doing all those inversion try to activate this muscle with consciousness and then go back down release your head let your head hang and you can open the arms towards the front and it 's great for that you can see you can probably feel that in your shoulders because it 's so now for the shoulders and shoulders quite often we tend to run up instead of opening up so any exercise that makes you up in the shoulders is a great thing before doing that it 's good to have a bit of a warm-up maybe some movement in your shoulders very simple circling to come out of the posture we 're going to bring our hands back to our back and slowly coming back up release the hands and come back up now we 're going to see a different version do you need to check your legs a bit maybe after being there great so feet inwards hands on hips so we 're going to go 've just done with a slight modification at the end which is much more advanced for for people who are much more confident and strong in their in the upper back and shoulders so your hands on my hips and again fold from the hips trying to keep your spine really straight a good way to know if your spine is straight is simply having your hands and you place them on your lower back parallel to your tailbone because quite often it 's our lower back that is rounding great put your hands down on the floor so you can have blocks or books blue-books works perfectly they just need to be the same height but you can place some under there if you 're not touching and you can also change the height you can have them quite high just to try to have that say she tends to be too flexible say she needs to really engage the core and that 's a really good exercise just to stay there and then from there we 're going to go into the inversion so let go off your crown of your head on the mat and you stay like that and as you can see again inversions the head and the heart giving relief to the pumping or serve their hearts and breaking to our brain so from there if you are confident to do so you can move into your handstand so it 's having a tripod between your hands and your head that is supporting you and you can bring your legs up vertically so for that you know if you 're not confident it 's great also to have someone to protect you from falling this way and then there 's different options with the legs that you can do in that posture but I cannot say nuts so that 's like a butterfly that we you 've probably done on the floor before on the mats and wide legged so that 's very similar to having the feet on and then slowly you come back down and you take a break in balasana child pose so it 's really important to start typos maybe with your forehead on the floor and then lifting that don 't have a block so your head is at the same level of your heart or just a bit higher just to bring back the circulation as normal so bringing blocked your head usually we 've got our face that becomes quite red and that 's okay it 's also learning to breathe outside on and doing things with your legs in the wrong you know in inverted position is really not easy at the beginning it 's a great exercise for the mind and our brain to understand what 's going on when we 're not used and we 've got a different position so it 's a really great experience and a lot of people really enjoy it but it takes practice and it 's really much easier to do that guided by a teacher simply because there 's a lot of things and especially with the neck on our handstand you don 't want to compress your neck obviously say that 's why we we try to to make sure we 've got the strength in the upper body and the shoulders and now we 're that strength in the shoulders see it 's a bit similar to downward dog that we 've done earlier and it 's called dolphin pose which is a really nice name so we put our elbows and our shoulders and our hands are paralleled to the side of the mat and they 're parallel our forearms great now we we like downward dogs we 're going to check out who 's lift our knees up the floor maybe walk them slightly more forward great and we try to relax our head down so the neck is long and in line with our spine and what we 're working on is really our shoulders so I 'm not sure you can see very well but so if she collapse and then she 's lifting what we want is to stay lifted so much more engaged in our shoulders and that requires some strength around the shoulders and just by staying there and holding the posture it 's a great way to strengthen it is it hard Talia yes Ari you can bend your knees as well to help with the the try to have your heels towards the mat it doesn 't matter if you don 't touch the mat it 's fine you can walk your your knees and when you try it you come back to balance and a child pose to rest for a bit so that 's a great exercise to really strengthen our shoulders and obviously doing downward dog as well we 'll do that so it 's a great way to buthe have the experience of inversion and the benefits of inversion while doing some strength exercise for going into you deeper and more complicated inversion great so now we 're going to move to think I 'm just checking cuz I don 't want to forget oh yes we 're going to move into halasana the pluie pose assume we 're going to use it a blanket for that and I invite you to have a blanket with you because it really helps to protect the neck so I 've got a yoga blanket it 's folded and you can fold it a bit more if you want more support to make a bit a normal folded blanket fort area today and we 're going to put our shoulders in line with the edge of the blanket say at the moment they 're not aligned and she 's going to move back a bit more the other way sweetie great that 's right and from there make the effort to really make sure your shoulder blades are flat on the mat you can relax your hands on the side palms up you can smile great and then we 're going to go into pluto 's say we move our legs bring our legs to either knees towards our chest and then yes and then we 're going to support up back with our hands so in that posture we 're trying to have a long vertical spine and it 's it 's it 's not an easy posture at all so you can use as well a bit of support under your feet so you feel a bit higher or just leave them up they don 't have to go onto the floor what we we try to do is really to make a important thing great from there we can move to a posture where our knees are in our ears that 's right so you need obviously a lot of flexibility to be able to do that and a lot of stretch in your spine where do you feel that Tanya your back yeah definitely it 's a great stretch to make more space in between our vertebra which is a very healthy thing to do but it is definitely not for everyone and it will it will in time come to you by practicing regularly great now we 're going to move into shoulder stand which is real the inversion posture that we first teach as yoga teachers because it 's the easiest one in a way you don 't have to kick you don 't have to have your head off the floor and you 're going to use your shoulders and your arms as well to press in the floor and you lift your legs and hips towards the ceiling supporting in your lower back with your hands so we 're trying to have the hands flat rather than as you can see can you come down here because you 've slipped slightly of the blanket so the blanket is helping to leave some room and space under your neck so your neck and your cervical are not completely compressed because we don 't want that so we always keep our chin close to our chest when we 're doing that kind of inversion and also we 're not looking left and right with just looking at the ceiling because otherwise you can really hurt our neck sorry your feet say yeah yeah you can look at your feet you can flex the feet or point them and you 're trying to have a line between your ankle your hips and your shoulders so tanya is doing a great job supporting your back is really helpful the full posture is without support and with your hands on the mat and you 're actively pressing on those hands and those arms so you 're using that force great and to come back you 're really supporting your hips and you 're trying to come one vertebra at a time so maybe rock side to side holding both knees and you can also rest in savasana so savasana is usually the posture we do at the end of the class savasana is just laying down on your back hands open feet apart and the feet are rolling out in relaxation and again trying to remember Jhin someone pressing into your shoulders and just feeling your neck and checking on your neck to make sure you have an crunch or upset any of the cervical there so that 's the most important point to keep in mind when you 're doing that kind of shoulder stand and handstand and now maybe we can move into your handstand shavasana but instead of coming from a wide legged position with just going to come from a more traditional way of lifting so we yeah that 's fine so we 're starting with our arms and we want to have the right distance between our elbows so we 're holding opposite arm with our hands and then we put our elbows on the floor open the fingers are going to interlace and between our hands the base of our kranj and we 're going to try to really have those elbows sinking into the mat and press into the mat and using that connection between our head and our elbows and our forearms as our support for a trip out sort of pose and then we lift our hips taking out toes walking our feet towards our head until our back is straight and the more you do that the easier it is to then lift one leg and it 's a great exercise just to leave one leg leg back other leg and just play with the balance and that 's another advantage I haven 't talked that yet inversion I 'm really helping our sense of balancing and that 's why one of the contraindication is any inflammation of the ear because without the ear it 's really hard to balance glaucoma is another really big contraindication high blood pressure any cardiovascular problems anything where you will challenge your heart but also your eyes so if you 've got an inflammation around the obviously because the blood is coming to our head the then you can stay there if you want that you 've got full advantage and benefits of the inversion or you can start by straight step yeah straightening the legs one by one or both together either and you can see it 's not completely still she 's still wobbling a lot a bit and it 's fine it 's it 's finding and playing with that sense of I want to find my balance I want to find my place on the floor being upside down so it 's a bit challenging so again really important to make sure you don 't have any pain in your neck because it 's really easy to to constrain the neck in that posture if you do come down and then change the position of your head to adjust whenever you need you you come down of the of the posture and if you feel after doing that kind of inversion that your neck is painful it 's not normal so you need to really change and modify or make sure you you 're listening to that part of your body we bodies and your sensation but especially with inversion where there 's a lot of pressure on the neck make sure you 're not putting any more pressure so yeah great what shall we finish with what do you want we can do this so then from there there 's a lot of variation of different posture which are really challenging and hard to do the the king of the posture in yoga are the handstand said you want to do a handstand so again you can you can try practicing handstand with a wall but more in a class environment or someone who can help you and otherwise I 'm just going to spot Talia to make sure she 's not coming all the way say there 's different way of starting at understand and obviously that 's not the yogi West are we going to try to do so maybe come yeah and then commit to your downward dog and from there you can kick one leg or both legs yeah that 's right so it 's all about playing as well like it 's not you know it difficult to find your balance so a temptation when you 're spotting is to hold the legs whereas it 's more about just offering that safety net that I 'm here and you can 't_''_1640.33 go all the way back it 's also great to learn how to roll up and roll your your hand your head I mean so you can roll all your body in a safe way when you 're falling you know when you 're going too much that way yeah so you know we know you know I 'm going to do you want to do any other scorpion you know the one on your on your 4c_._1667.74 forearm on the floor and with your legs up that way yeah so this is also a really advanced posture that chharia is going to try so you can have one leg on each side or both leg coming out this one requires quite a lot of flexibility in the back as well as strength and core strength it 's really a delicate posture to be able to do great well thank you very much Talia for enjoyed watching and learning a bit more about inversion inversion are really important and they 're hard to start because of that fear of falling so that 's why I think for me it 's not about trying like the hardest the first but really building on and and finding the playfulness and the child in you to do that and to try and fall and try again and learning perseverance and to see how also you can engage your whole body and especially that spine back and core which will change your posture and improve your posture to strengthen this part of our body so that 's it for us today yeah thank you so much Talia for joining today and namaste everyone and I wish you a beautiful day for the rest of your day and be playful and enjoy the Sun and stay safe and not too close to each other except with your family thank you you _"

    "text": "hi everyone I 'm Kath I 'm the public health nutritionist working at Food Bank WI Geraldton branch and today we 'll be doing some demo cooking from our delicious healthy recipes did you know that food bank WS the state 's largest food relief organization that provides over 6 million meals a year to people in need and in Geraldton we realize strongly on rescued and denied and products that would otherwise go to landfill today we 'll be doing our Sencha well it comes from our recipe book food sensations for adults number 2 and did you know that we run the Cession food sensations for adult over four weeks period it 's funded by Department of Health and we do a lot of talking and nutrition and we also do a lot of cooking so if you are interested in joining us I 'll let you know how you can do that towards the end of the session today but let 's get going into our preparing our Center well so you can see that I have all my ingredients today I have some mushrooms some shallots I 've cooked my rice and I have lettuce that I will be using as plates so this is my Sencha we 're about to be cooked here I have my shallots in one of my great saving tips for you is to keep these little parts here of the shallots and just put them in the water and you 'll see them grow over a week and then you don 't have to buy shallots so this is a little more money saving tips this is part of our third session of the food sensation this little shallot has a little shoot I don 't know if you can see it it has about two days old so I cut it two days ago and you can see the little shoot already coming so I would encourage you and your kids to look after these shallots and that 's a great way to save some money instead of keeping buying our spring onions all the time so I 'll just cut these finely there 's about six of them here and then what we 'll do we 'll be minute or so we 'll add our chicken mince to the mix and today I bought some chicken mince because I just found that at the shop there was a special on the chicken mince but you could use pork mince or beef mince I just felt that saving a little bit of money was a good way to go when you want to you know look after your food budget and as I said in our third session of the food sensation for adult we do talk about budgeting and we do talk about meal planning so I 'll just put my shallots here Oh heat up my pan a little bit more to about medium so if you have any money saving tips I would encourage you to post them on the Facebook page see what you do some people will say they avoid being hungry when they go to the shop that 's a great tip so you don 't end up buying too much food other people will say stick to your list so I find this is also a good one other people might find cupboard so they don 't end up doubling up what they already have if you see meat on special it might be a good way to just purchase it and put it in the freezer and we can hear that sizzling of the shallots yeah beautiful green lots of flavor and when it gets just a little bit cook it 's time to put your mint in now with mints just be careful because there 's always a little bit of vapor there and you don 't want to cook this so putting my mints and these electric fans are fantastic you 'll see that we have a lot of our recipes and our books that are cooked in electric fans like this okay so now I 'm just gonna cook my chicken for a little bit we don 't want to overcook the chicken but we don 't want to undercook it either I find mints really really good to have as a back-up plan you can make speck board you can make chili from Tom you can make patties the Sun shower is excellent for lunch or dinner having a little picnic in the backyard can be a really good idea get the kids out and please involve your kids and cooking that 's how they 're gonna learn and enjoy everything you make for them okay so I can see that my chicken is going nicely right now a little bit of raw a bit still and I have already done my threat for my veggies so with the veggies one cup of raw veggies is like one serve we need about five serves of veg a day so in here I have about one to three and a half cups oil already have three and a half cups of veggies that I 'm going to add here of course I 'm going to be sharing that meal so these veggies are not all mine but I 'm still increasing my entire and I have my mushroom and by serving these in the lettuce leaf it 's another way to increase your veggies you could also add some lentils to that or some any legumes so another great saving tips upon legumes are really cheap and they having lentils chickpeas kidney beans in your cupboard or in a dry container and just soaking them in the morning or overnight you can really save you some money okay I 'll turn that down a little bit so it doesn 't burn while I 'm mixing my sources so I need 2 tbsp of soy or fish sauce depending what you prefer today I have soy but I really like it with fish sauce as well I need about 2 tbsp of sweet chili sauce just to give a little bit of flavor little bit of spice oops and then I have my white rice vinegar then 2 tbsp as well and I 'm gonna finish with my ginger I need 1 teaspoon so this one comes from a job but I would also encourage you to have fresh ginger at home it 's really yummy and once again a bit like the shallots you could cut the bulb of ginger I put it in the ground and it makes a beautiful plant so feel free to do that give it a little stir to the sauce I have I 'm going to add and stir through and once this is all nicely so through I can then put my sauce in and now you see the colors of the veggies colors of the soy all taking the flavors I 'm sure people that are filming me can smell and here we are letting it just simmer a little bit while it 's simmering I 'm just gonna review what we 've talked about so let it just it a little bit longer I 'm making sure it 's so nicely cooked so basically today we made the Sancho well coming from our recipe book from our food sensation for adults program this program as I said runs over four weeks and it 's funded by Department of Health at the moment we 're running it online for three weeks and we don 't have the cooking component but I would invite you to go on the waw AWI superhero foods HQ got all the a you to have all our recipes we have many recipe books all our resources and if you attend the classes you of course and the program as I said is free so we might be ready now to the chef make a little bit of room on my table here and as I said these little lettuce cup are great as a mini plight so we 're ready to just grab a little bit of the mix and then you dish out in your lettuce cup like this I 've previously washed my lettuce cup so it 's all good and I 've cut the bottom of the lettuce I like to use bay because because they seem to be a bit smaller in a bit rounder you could also use um iceberg lettuce I find if you 're going to a barbecue sometimes because you can have this cold as well so if you 're going to a barbecue that 's a nice plate to bring along people seem to enjoy those and what I 've done I didn 't cut all my shallots I saved one so you can just chop up the last little shallot or if you have a bit of parsley or fresh basil gonna put that home or if you have fresh chilli to give extra flavor that 's really beautiful so that 's all for now please stay tuned for more to come and I hope you enjoy today 's session stay well stay healthy and safe and stay connected thank you very much have a lovely day _"

    "text": "hello again from CGG TV and the Queens Park Theatre as I told you before my name is null agree agree on the community and original development of so for the city of granite children and because of Ovid 19 we aren 't able to have a proper celebration this year for national reconciliation week so what we 're doing is doing videos of Aboriginal people in the community that we 'd like to introduce to you out there in the wider community so I have the absolute pleasure in introducing mrs. Gloria Fogerty Gloria is one of our last storytellers we don 't have many storytellers left in joltin one of our biggest ones just recently passed away and Mr Cameron rest in peace but Gloria tell us a little bit about yourself please I was born in Perth I was I 'm from stolen generation I was taken away when I was about nine years old it 's been most of my years in homes in Perth I ran away from the home when I was 15 as I found out my mother was in a big fire before 15 months they couldn 't find me I must have been hiding pretty well that 's why I 'm so tiny I think I fit into it but um I I came here met up with a fellow I had three kids to him we parted quite a ways back and I raised all my kids mostly on my own my children represented WN softball and netball awesome I played a lot of sports here and I mixed it with everything though one of the games that I hated though was cricket they come and pick me up was on a set of the Saturday evening celebration oh I mean my cousin and they picked me up still out drunk the next morning they said they needed somebody to fill in to make the squad of a cricket team so he gets down there on lines up and I got out for a doctor and I didn 't like it so I said no I won 't ever go again I said no you can 't because I was lining up I didn 't know the rules about cricket went home I got the sack from the cricket team but I I did I did Aboriginal health working I won a scholarship when I was in the gumbo mission I think that was around mine or 1969 or 68 69 somewhere there and it was for working with children and I ended up seeing too many babies born I did nursing here at the Jordan Regional Hospital I was here for three years in the hospital I had enough for seeing babies born so I quit then I became a domestic at the hospital again I played still went on and played a lot of sports I think I was a rebel or softball they couldn 't catch me I played every game in the last two two years of having children I was pregnant with them sliding into basis I couldn 't remember you jumping off the Debbie that they used to have what 's real time very pregnant with a baby right up the top on the top railing Apple yes yes off the doll from swimming out what all funds come a little little prep in it was that 's great so what do you think of this year 's reconciliation thing what does it mean to you in this together well it 's exactly what it says we 're all in this together everybody black white you name it all cultures and the thing that needs to happen they 're children the kids younger generation they need to understand and they need more support from the parents I 've visited quite a few different areas in Europe and in the last five months since I 've been off work I work as a ranger I 'm the only Ranger in the Midwest from Perth to Mount Newman Kenard burn Valona and um a registered ranger I work for Mount Gibson I 've been down there for 12 months and because of this virus where we stop work I 'm getting a lot of people asking me about weather where can the kids go you know what can they do yeah there 's no involvement from the parents so I think it 's up to the parents to get get going get their kids together um being with kids I have kids all the time you can remember one time hearing girl from we took out my sister-in-law came to me one Friday afternoon she said I want to go bush and the next thing I knew we had 16 kids in our house and I don 't know they would these are the things that we used to gather up the kids and take them out worship always I 've just come back from a big funeral 300 people was at that funeral and the first thing the kids said was Arnie are you still working and can we come down to where you 're working so in this together yet where we all have to make the effort to you know respond to the kids yeah respond to the kids and teaching teaching the non Aboriginal community about the aboriginal elders and it 's not only the non Aboriginal community as we heard from young Dana Merritt in a previous video is that it 's really important for the both non-aboriginal and aboriginal kids to sit down and listen to their elders that something when they pass away their story goes with them if there 's no one to tell their story that 's very sad so as a young person I encourage you out there to listen to the elders and tell their story so Gloria we 've got some some things in front of us on the table can you tell us a little bit about what what these you think again and what they mean to you they 're two stones that you see is the grinder and the grindstone plate I found these quite a few years ago at my Nana 's old block in Mount Magnus I knew they were there somewhere I was one of the last children there was only three of us two boys and a

    "text": "hi everyone welcome back again to the Queens Park Theatre and national reconciliation week and the theme for 2020 is in this together and I 'm just reading a little bit off of the national reconciliation Australian website so chief executive officer Karen mundane said that Australia 's ability to move forward as a nation relies on individuals organisations and communities coming together in the spirit of reconciliation the national reconciliation week theme 2020 reinforces that we all have a role to play when it comes to reconciliation and in playing our part we collectively build relationships and communities that value Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples histories and cultures she said when we come together to build mutual respect and understanding we shape a better future for all Australians so I would like to introduce you to on my right mr. Ronald cross who works with bandiera Aboriginal organization in Jordan sitting next to me on my right is mr. Graham Taylor who is one of our return service myths and has had a lot of history regarding returned servicemen in in Jordan and on my left I have teacher with the it a Wankel language centre which is based at Bundy era and Edie has also previously been an education yes an education teacher as well so the question that I want to ask Ronald first is what does in it together mean to you for this theme for this year well for me basically I see it as the occupation of this country it 's gonna be recognised that it was not a vacant country and people now have got to recognize this that this land was stolen from our people and we need to say get them to realize that fact and then maybe we can reconcile what needs to be done no worries and gram what does this use them mean to you to me it means more work together doesn 't matter who you are but as long as the people realized that the Aboriginal people are the original these people lives come from this country and we all get together and in harmony and work through everything so that we can make Australia a better place thank you and Edie what would you also to recognize our culture 's very strong cultures in the past and before as well living here our people living here for many thousands of years so just recognizing that moving forward working together as a school educator within my teaching teaching the students exactly that moving forward together and for everyone all Australians to recognize our culture what it was and what it is now and within my work but it a longer reconciling with teaching the language Aboriginal languages eight languages in the Midwest alone bringing everyone together at school in the community Thank You eating 's and Ronald tell us a little bit about your story sure story my story in what seems well what have you what have you done for the community in German where do you work tell us a bit about your job that you do at Monday era when the era started there at eight years ago working as environmental health worker and since I 've left there and I 've come back to build the war memorial and we got up there and I volunteer my services then now great served in the Army as well haven 't you and Graham tell us a little bit about yourself I know you 've done a lot of work in the community and you 've actually previously been a winner of the other of the year for NATO haven 't you yeah you have been in Jordan number of years maybe 40 odd or say yeah because my oldest son tan fully this year and through that time in 2008 I got the aboriginal elder here in the Midwest through the guilt in region and 2012 of us in the Hall of Fame for bandiera in 2015 that 's when I won the National Aboriginal elder of the year I 've done a trip over to Adelaide and received that award that was quite enjoyable that trip and I sat next to people like mr. Warren mundane and mr. Louis I don t hear I was quite placed to sit next to them because you know I knew then but they didn 't know me but at the end of the night they was all shaking my hands you know they all was quite good but before then not six years in the Army and I went to Vietnam for seven months and in Malaya for six months all overseas and then when I got out I came back to the Midwest and was on the guilt and main roads for ten years and I 've been e ever since been working Wood Street ease for a number of years chair person there for a number of years and in the last couple of years I thought I 'd retire and pull out and let all these young folk take over step up step up yeah and in which they did were just quite good and and now I 'm involved with the Bundy era War Memorial which Ronnie started with he 's um you know a new idea and I just thought of mod help him out would list of names and going through contacts with the RSL and everything and and also we had one lady elf in us to sue would the name see she done all the groundwork you know getting all the names together and then our for a number of years too and he mentioned his oldest boy I actually taught in Georgian we have an Aboriginal preschool previously it used to be known as make away Aboriginal in school and Graham 's children attended there and I talked about that preschool yourself in your work at the Language Center and also with the schools as well with the school here but I started in Northampton where I lived with my husband and family and 1996 I started as an AI oh the North happened the disparate high school and my pathway was from there to the studied the to be a language teacher and taught that at Northampton Bluff point school and the Holland street special school for a few years so then I went on to Curtin University and came out as a qualified teacher so then I got a job at the Jordan senior so I went up to the senior senior level teaching year living in football year tens I started in 11 and 12 where it was a waste subject so in the Football Academy and the girls program a Beulah 12 years in this high school yeahjust and it was good because what was that what was that what were the clearing I did was a very accepting of the language being taught yes yeah because most of them came through primary learning the language so they were very familiar very excited keen and the best part it was counted in their waste certificate that was really good that 's um that 's one really good thing about Georgia and one of the really good things is that we 've got an amazing language program here at the Etowah our language center which is at at Bundy era and anybody else want to say anything else about what you think this year 's theme means to you in this together recognizing but for me it 's about recognizing the work that all of the elders in our community past have done for us and it 's about us carrying that through to our younger generation and the younger generation sitting down and listening and it 's about teaching that to our wider community than an Aboriginal community and teaching them them so anybody else want to add a little bit about your life for I just like to say that in the guilt and region there 's a hell of a lot of Aboriginal people living here you know mainly young Aggies but also we 've got people from all around waa they 've found this place you know a good place to live and you know if we can all get together and be s 1 so that the Midwest you know it 'll be fine you know the REC reconciliation there 's always got to be you know working together anything to add no it 's basically well Gramercy there 's so many different communities coming into Jordan that if we knit as one will show it ourselves as a strong force and maybe people will understand and look at our culture and traditions and maybe reconcile with that so in finishing I would just I would just like to invite people out there in the community you 've heard us talk about some of the organization 's here bandiera aboriginal corporation you 've heard us talk about one in and the pet name for us is Street ease but the proper name for that is Jordan Street work aboriginal corporation and they they have worked for many many many years in the Jordan community with the youth so we have a very we have some very strong organizations in shorten the non Aboriginal community out there I 'm inviting you ring them up talk to them go and go and visit them you heard Graham you heard run all talk about them the absolutely beautiful war memorial that we have out there for our aboriginal returned service men and women ring Bundy are up and asked if you can go out and have a look at it they have a beautiful bow shed out there that you can sit under and reflect they have the street work youth organization just across the road go and talk to them and ask them about the Aboriginal culture get out there and do it don 't be ashamed that 's what I say we 're here to help you thank you thank you _"

    "text": "hey rockers flashman here welcome to CGG TV today I 'm here to talk about tarot reading what it is what it isn 't and how we can use it in our daily lives for visual literacy exercising our intuition and for connecting spiritually with ourselves or with our our higher self now tarot you 've probably heard of before and Oracle they 're different okay oracle cards stand alone okay so while there are thousands of different oracle dicks out there and they 've been made from the intuition of the creator tarot decks are part of a system anywhere you go in the world just about tarot cards each tarot card means the same thing or has similar energies even though the images are different and each artist puts in different ideas so every time you get a new tarot deck you 're looking at each specific card separately but you can always rely back on the energies okay but tarot decks 78 cards in a deck okay just about all the Tarot decks you come across will be based on this one here you see the back okay now these are the rider-waite tarot did all the other tarot decks in the world are based on these ones here and all your text books or most of your text books will be based on the images in the rider-waite tarot deck so if you 're getting into Tarot that 's something to remember when you 're checking out online or whatever the way to study the common language if you like is is from the rider-waite tarot deck yeah cards in the Tarot can have many different meanings depending on where they are in the spread and there are thousands of different spreads out there so a spread is the way we lay out the cards okay so you might lay them out like this or like this okay many different ways okay probably the go-to tarot spread will be the Celtic Cross which is this one down here okay and so most of your tarot readers and you probably if you take up Tarot that would be one of the first spreads you so today what I 'm going to do is I 'm going to you might not and you 'll understand a little bit more hopefully about what it is and what it isn 't by what I say okay so we all have our little rituals what I do is I shuffle the cards okay just till it feels right then everything again in this is about intuition when it feels right I cut the deck three times okay and then I 'm ready to go okay a lot of readers are tap the deck like this okay now our first card here this is where you are now this is the high priestess so the high priestess is the feminine expression of spirituality so you 'll see there that she 's sitting with a blue veil behind her between those two columns the black column and the white column okay so the high priestess is using her intuition to move between the unseen world and the world the 3d world that we see and you see she has a the scriptures in her lap so she 's studying or investigating or looking at something to do with the esoteric world the spiritual in your opening position you might be looking at chakras or meditations or having a look dabbling in something to do with esoteric matters the occult world okay so that 's our opening position here then in the Celtic cross again we have what 's challenging you okay or what 's brought this about what 's impacting this and we have the temperance card now the temperance card is a card of angelic guidance okay we get this card when it 's time to ask the angels for something you 'll see the angel here mixing these chemicals trying to get it just right it 's actually mixing the spirituality trying to find balance here so when you get this card it 's a sign that you 're coming into balance it can also mean that you 've come to a certain stage in your spiritual development we you need to ask the angels for advice to move beyond that angel up the path behind you see that so you 're asking for enlightenment now it 's important to remember when you are communicating with angels is you must ask and your intention is there angels don 't offer you things you must ask but if you 're if you 're sincere about it and your intention is pure it will come to you okay now the next card in our in our Celtic cross is your conscious goals so what are you aiming for and you have here the knight of cups so just like in a normal deck of cards we have hearts diamonds clubs spades or in the Tarot we have cups swords Pentacles and ones and they all represent different things so the cups represent emotions and spirituality and this is the knight of cups which is a court card so Knights in the Tarot generally bring messages okay and this Knight is bringing a message of love or emotional fulfillment and because this is in your conscious goal position perhaps you are looking for your knight in shining armor to make an offer to use some kind of emotional connection okay and Knights are generally sincere in what they do okay and the news they bring okay so knight of cups this person also represents links between astrology and the Tarot and the cups represent the signs of Pisces cancer and Scorpio so there could be someone of that star sign around you who you 're interested in or there 's some kind of offer you want to make to them or you 're hoping they will make it to you now in your unknown influence okay you have the nine of Pentacles so the Pentacles in the Tarot represent money earthly things career material things finances that sort of thing and you see this person standing alone in that field with their Pentacles quite abundant and that bird on her hand can come and go as it pleases so this person standing alone in this field is feeling quite independent and that bird can come and go she 's good either way ok so there 's an underlying energy around this whole reading this whole spread that says you are independent and that 's having an impact on all the other energies around you ok now let 's have a look at your recent past so something which has happened in your past which now and you have the king of swords so in the Tarot these swords and the sword suit represents thinking clarity and analysis communication decisions and this person is the king of decisions the king of communications so if you get this card in the in your recent past perhaps there was a judge who has made a legal decision and it has brought you to where you are now because the king of swords court often represents a judge or a like a chief executive officer someone like that who the buck stops with him ok he 's very much a no white kind of a person not much emotion you 'll have a look at that sword they 're cold hard steel he doesn 't deal with emotions he deals with facts just like a judge does and so if this readings resonating for you in the recent past it would have been a legal decision come down or a decision by some kind of chief executive someone like that which has had an impact on the energies playing out for you at the moment now in your have the four of Pentacles so we know that the Pentacles are all about money and Curry 's things like that now this is the four of Pentacles and look what 's happening look at the body language of this person holding on to these Pentacles tightly one talk to his chest the other one 's stomping down those Pentacles those coins with his feet and he 's got one on his head as well and his turning his back on the city so when you get this card perhaps there 's an element of turning your back on the group or on the city or on the established way and perhaps you 're moving away to study you 'll see that pentacle on the top of this person 's head perhaps you 're holding yourself off from socializing for a while so you can save some money and sometimes this is about holding back your emotions from someone perhaps keeping secrets from the group it 's not a sinister card but it is kind of saving money turning your back on the group just like this person is turning going sometimes you might be thinking of travelling so saving up to go traveling just like this person here perhaps saving up to go further afield okay so our next card is what you 're bringing to the situation what talents are you bringing what 's your what 's your energy around you at the moment you have the hangman now the hangman is the card of Pisces generally okay and you 'll see this person hanging upside down waiting for this great idea to come to him now he 's not uncomfortable he 's waiting for something and I 'm bit many of us right now are waiting for something to occur waiting to get going again waiting for a change in perspective and so if this is your reading right now you 're waiting for something to happen perhaps waiting for some information for a decision to come which is going to move you further and give you that bright light that great idea you have but it is important look this this person is not uncomfortable this comes from one of those Nordic stories from the Norse was ordered to hang upside down for nine days and during hanging upside down he saw the world differently and that new perspective gave him advantages later on in his adventures and helped him win his battles then and outsmart others okay so a wonderful car there of waiting and patience now your environment the way you see the world the way the world sees you and you have the nine of cups so you 'll remember here that the nine of cups or the cups are about emotions they 're about spirituality sometimes now this is the number nine this is known as the wish fulfillment card this person is sitting there arms crossed all his cups above him feeling quite smug feeling very satisfied with himself so this card is about reaching a certain goal a milestone you haven 't reached the ten yet which is the which is the ultimate happiness but you know your will on the way and this is a a time for you to sit back and celebrate sometimes this can be a card of arrogance and being a little bit too bit done but that will usually come out in a specific personal reading to you and what you 're picking up from it but definitely a very happy card and because it says this is in the challenge in the position of how the world seeing you how you 're seeing the world or your environment people are seeing you as being pretty lucky and pretty abundant or perhaps you 're seeing yourself as abundant in the world so what are you what are your hopes and fears is our next card so what are you hoping for or perhaps what are you fearing depending on what the card is and this is the page of swords so we know that the page of swords is about what swords are about thinking about analysis about research and about studying so perhaps you 're hoping to study something but it 's also a card of gossip so you might be a little bit worried about secrets coming out especially around this time of the Scorpio full moon coming up lots of things will be exposed so there could be again study gossip a lot of people are you interested in doing stuff online basically okay now this is a young person who 's only a page and so it can be a bit of a smart aleck sometimes okay I can communicate sometimes goes against the grain you 'll have a look at the the pictures of the trees in the back ground behind him they 're blowing one way and he 's like facing it charging it the other way yes come on I 'll take is on so a young upstart kind of energy or some kind of research or study that you 're hoping to to happen but it 's also a card of being worried that perhaps someone might be investigating you and looking for some kind of truth or something that you don 't really want them to know now in your outcome position you have the four of Wands this is a beautiful card this is a card of longevity it 's a card of happy home of stability to Carlo look at the the family in the background there 's a couple celebrating between eleven as though they have everything so if this is your outcome it 's a wonderful card of the happy home it 's also a card of doing things around the home so perhaps you know renovations or even buying and selling property sometimes some of you might be moving okay and as a result of the energies around you but generally it 's a wonderfully optimistic card where you 're feeling that things are really moving your way okay so there 's your outcome we also in the tower we look at the bottom of the deck which is like an underlying energy okay and you have here the king of Pentacles so we know that the king of Pentacles is all about well the the Pentacles are all about money and success and this person is the king of money and success surrounded by pinnacles in his abundance there are lots of green which represents abundance in the Terra and so you might be feeling very successful very financially abundant in whatever you 've done or you 've reached a certain milestone where you 're quite comfortable there and the king and Pat direct others to they 're material gains okay so a very optimistic card so if I was going to look at this this whole spread I would say that packs there 's a there 's an element of moving away and you might be researching something to move away to or how are you going to move away now that wasn 't in the cards themselves totally that 's something which came to me intuitively which is really what the Tarot is all about you 'll find that the more involved you get with Tarot the intuition is like a muscle the more you use it the stronger it gets and you 'll you 'll start to astound people with the insight that you have and and it 's just about trusting your hunches okay so if you 're involved in Tarot just trust yourself and that trust will come out in what you say and we are all connected and the more you do it the more you practice it the more you 're going to realize that so I hope that 's dispelled a wonderful tool for visual literacy exercising your intuition and and hopefully connecting with the world around you the spiritual world around you if you 'd like something a bit more specific to you or you 'd like to know more about tarot please come and see me at the Tarot temple or get in touch through Facebook or sort something out for you thank you so much for watching thank you see GG TV I really hope to see you soon Love Wins _"

    "text": "[Music] living on the Molly wool fringes became my people 's place when a colonial Township emerged like a pimple in the wildflowers foreign church structures rose dominating the landscape family showed me the quarry from which the rocks were taken building the white man 's worship place mala well reserved nearby along the mullah wall maura wardrobe Aboriginal hands helped build that temple their energy and sweat is in them rocks their heart is in them rocks ores didn 't do it on his own wonder if that is written anywhere as a child I peered into that curious why gargoyles watched the entry frightened to look at the statues inside tell me a bit about this place that we 're on now so this place here that we 're on now is owned by the Catholics of course now but it 's the site of what 's known as the joltin town camp from 1850 which is the time of white settlement to 1917 the Aboriginal people who lived at the Geraldton town camp were alienated from the country 1917 was the same time that that large structure to rise up out of the ground and and break through this concrete and say Here I am this is the story don 't forget me don 't forget the people that were on this land before from 1850 to 1917 so there 's two things happening there one people being moved off their land and alienated from it and forcibly removed and to a foreign religion coming and placing and stamping their mark on traditional country so of course what 's happened is that one story is visible and one 's not and that 's my job as a descendant of the energy people is to make sure that the visibility of our stories are brought to the surface and are not forgotten so when we look at this site those of us that have been told and and choose to remember when we look at this site we don 't just see monsignor wars sitting there with these dog we don 't just see the cathedral we don 't see all this concrete and built-up land to me in my mind what I see is a traditional campsite from their culture from their old way of life so this new society can build its religious structures and dominate the landscape that 's what I see yeah tell me about the horse myth I don 't think yours is really well known for designing these brilliant structures at because they are magnificent to look at you know they look out of place these really commanding structures but what 's happened over the year is this myth this come from the living archives of people that have handed down I 'm not talking about Aboriginal people I 'm talking about what full of people and what people say is ah built this church actually no he designed the church but in mullah war for instance Yemeni people helped quarry the rock local farmers local people helped build the church and so their blood sweat and tears are in these structures just as much as I don 't think made that myth I think it was a public and it 's kind of like we 'll hang on a minute yes he designed it but no he didn 't build it his own let 's privilege the other people who need to be on it who need to no longer be nameless in this process and let 's just burst that myth apart that 's kind of what I 've done if you 've seen the collages so they 're series of for unraveling archives that mark and I did and it 's it 's doing that it 's bursting that bubble of this myth and it 's also bursting that bubble of the terra nullius myth where when this country was settled invaded it was it was done so on the false claims of no people living on the land it was empty and it was therefore taking and that 's the story we 're pushing up back against this exclusion [Music] been working for a little while over the last three years with my sons doing some cultural knowledge transfer with him and teaching him stories about the different traditional Aboriginal sites in Georgia and that 's what 's come out over a couple of the art projects alternative archives in particular provided a really good opportunity to revisit out onto country and went to four significant sites within the City of Greater Geraldton and just talked more about Mexico so we went to a massacre site about 10k is 15 K is out of Geraldton we went to the bluff point shell middens which of course you know is evidence of our occupation on these lands prior to a settlers arriving here I took him to other points to talk about and show him different vegetables and plants that were used for traditional fishing methods not only to teach mark about this cultural knowledge because this was ended on to me and now is this time to hand on to one of my sons but also to stimulate Marc 's way as being an emerging printmaker to start thinking about conceptualizing stories and and getting himself ready for his own artworks the most important thing for me is I don 't own anyone 's response the way people respond to it if people feel uncomfortable that I 'm playing around in cutting up cult figure images or if people feel uncomfortable that I 'm saying something against their 't own the way people respond to it that 's that 's not for me what I do own is a responsibility of making stories visible and a project like alternative archives allows that it gives me that opportunity to make a story visible in a mainstream space really quite interesting in this sort of really conservative environment of Geraldton to allow those sorts of conversations to happen ones that other people might find confronting because lots of people like to play it safe and produce pretty stuff that you know might make you feel all good or might get you to think in a certain way about an art technique or something like that but not necessarily about the stories and the stories where Yemeni people are invisible and to me that 's important because these are my people [Music] you [Music] _"

    "text": "hello and welcome to CGG TV my name 's sue Shira and I 'm here with Godfrey Simpson and Jacqui Cooke from the bundy our Irawan girl language center now maybe some of you don 't even know where the language center is well if you don 't its opposite the race course on Eastwood Road so we 're here to tell you a little bit about what goes on there and I will hand you over to Godfrey to talk a little bit about his involvement in the language center hi everyone my name is Godfrey s who 's mentioned my being involved with the Language Center for the last 27 years I think there about if we remind him one building I 'd definitely be part of the furniture there but I 've been involved with I think there 's four or five different language centers throughout the throughout the years were now based permanently down at Bundy era on Eastwood Road me the racecourse and yeah I I 've just had a love for languages not only my languages studied Indonesian in high school I still speak other than Australian languages plus I 'd love to learn more straggling we just how many do you study now Godfrey through the Language Center there 's seven week careful maintain throughout the Murchison Gascoigne from kanava noon to me Kythera then back down to Jordan here 's the we learn new language just up near the bowels River is the natural border which crosses over into Nanda and then you go a further think it 's past the murchison river up past the Murchison house I believe will bit further you come into Morgan a country where sharp Bay is and then from Morgana country you get into England a country which is Canaveral and then we go we take the languages inland there 's water young no longer gnarley '_``_135.37 Wonka back towards me Kythera wiry is quite prominent it 's it 's the most spoken language therefore for instance the it being taught throughout the entire Murchison Gascoigne region except canal them they do teaching in Goethe there it 's taught here in will a new country and I Ramallah war yell GU mount magnet that 's far south as del Walla knew so the entire more like region and yeah and Jackie you linguist with the Language Center what does a linguist do it 's a good question sir usually quite confused by what linguists do there 's quite a variety of things that different linguists in different positions do at the Language Center being a linguist is about sort of being able to interpret some of the research that 's been done on our languages to then contribute to community projects at the moment we 've been working on an updated version of the wedge de de dictionary so Godfrey 's been helping us with that we 've been doing lots of audio recording and just making sure that you know all of the little details about grammar and stuff is is clear so that people can understand it when they pick up the dictionary they know what they 're reading about and sort of checking through all that kind of stuff we also work on book projects like not just ixnay as like story books and stuff and yeah just sort of supporting the old version of the word City dictionary now we 're working on a updated one it should be nice and exciting when it comes out hopefully around the middle of the year Franco free can you tell us a little bit about your journey of coming to coming into this and learning language and sort of we got started what interested you what inspires you well I was born Aboriginal obviously from a winery father and the body of our mother there are geographically you know where that is now after my first intro part of my intro and my grandparents my father 's parents I spent a lot of time with those grandparents added new forestation yellow long station I learned to walk or crawl and walked out there and being with my grandparents and and their peers there was constant language all I heard was wondering when Yuri Wonga wide Yuri language so by the time I was at least you know three or four I think it had already been you know the blueprint was there and as we grew you know there people you know my of drifted off throughout the years and I noticed I was the only one who was still there willing to be told off and growl at and because that 's a lot of Oh lots of flutter telling us the others didn 't like being told off her that 's where they that 's where we differed and they went their own way and started you know just being kids I guess I was the weird one I stayed and I listened and listened and listened and listened and listened and we 're very grateful you did and I 'm grateful to now after all the years of working with the language sent in all the work of I 've helped to contribute contributor to have the years guarded by the elders always guarded by the elders I will not move forward without the elders and I mean it 's so cliche with Aboriginal communities throughout the world you don 't you know you the elders are there they are they have to be Western education as well you went to Guildford Grammar School yeah in 1989 I went down I was private school and now co-ed and how was that for you it was culture shock it was a very big culture shock why I wanted to run away but I was taught to stick to it everything everything that I was taught by my parents from grandparents was don 't walk or you know never be afraid of anything whether it 's from this realm or the other realm there 's a view spirit to one day out there and just life in general and just take things as they come and roll with the punches and I supposedly what I 've done my entire life and it 's paid off for you and it 's paid off I like to think it is yeah I just seem to help people 's praises because if it wasn 't for our elders my oldest joy elders all the elders throughout the world none of us would be here they paved the way throughout this entire world and we we have to keep the torch burning and carry it and pass it on yeah that 's what I 'm trying do you enjoy about being a linguist and working at the language centre I guess the nicest thing about working in a language centre as opposed to sort of a university more traditional research environment is being able to work directly with people like Godfrey not to say that people at universities don 't because a lot of them do go to communities as well but here we 're situated with the community and everything that we do is directly involved with what the community want to do or communities I should say we 've got lots of communities here so you know we don 't have our own projects that we then go and ask people that go through about Godfrey comes to us and says here 's something we need to do you know we say oh well what do what do you guys want to work on and so that 's how we come to these dictionary projects that 's how we come to book projects like one that we 're working on for what do you go at the moment with speaker up there you know were working with which i think is the most rewarding thing about working in this environment and and and the community in general so to elaborate on what jackie saying as an Aboriginal community we there 's myself and a number of other Aboriginal language workers we then take the thoughts of the language center out to the community it will then go through a community meeting we have at least three or four days a year where the entire wider e nation comes to Jordan and has a meeting one day or a two-day meeting and then that 's put through the mill there if you like and then what the community community decides there will take back to the language of it and that 's a lot of our works been done and the Language Center also produces a lot of resources for teaching and and a lot of it has been introduced into schools with the resource and so the wonderful thing about the Language Center is we 've got very well trained people like Godfrey there 's a few other language workers who work with us leave the resource development up to them they 've got the better training for that kind of stuff so if there 's any sort of technical questions about grammar things that we need to read into I sort of help out with that but most you don 't need me the anti lien miracles of good artist Nadine Taylor Marty and Edie mom I felt bad Marty Nadine Taylor you need Rosalie they do a great work great job and others that have come through there however they used got Young 's artena their money stay in there Hawkins she 's doing a good job see isn 't she come a long way that girl and Jackie would you like to talk a little bit about the warrior project that 's unfortunately due to this so we were actually supposed to be going out on this big sort of two-week on country trip in sort of a week oh sorry but obviously that 's not gonna happen to later in the year room cleared for health stuff but we sweaty yoga there 's a fabulous old man in his 80s language he 's come down and had chapters good for as well and so he 's really excited to put together a book in his language and to teach his family about his language and so the idea of the trip is that it does all of those things and so we 've invited a lot of researchers along as well so they 'll be you know people who are looking into the plants people who are looking into sort of mapping the territory people who are looking at the cultural information you know myself and Rosie who also works at the Language Center looking into language so to be a very sort of lots of perspectives that we 're trying to collect and his family will be there as well and so the idea is that we 're all doing our research at the same time and he 's able to teach his family through this on country trip where we go around and we sort of he tells stories about this sites and shows us the plants and the animals and so could you tell them where roughly 's all pastoral stations up there there 's not a town sight on what yoga country but yeah it 's a longer coumarine Arad ass come back in to kill Arvin mad Augusta between Mad Augusta and Marina Roadhouse [Laughter] and those are gonna be artists taking in this and and from this there will be an exhibition of the artists work that they paint on country and also in a workshop back in can Arvin that will be part of the project and the book we hope to finish and have that published as well so there 's there 's lots of resources out at Bundy era if people would like to come and have a look and perhaps buy some of the books there 's some beautiful books out there and and just come out and have a chat and find out what happens out there cup of tea yes and here 's how you can find us the website is Bundy Ericom and the Facebook page it 's bandiera little longer Language Center and you can email us at language at 81 gorg donate you know just come out and have a yarn _"

    "text": "hi everyone i 'm kath i 'm a public health nutritionist working at food bank in wi at the geraldton branch today i 'll be doing some cooking demo from our delicious cooking recipes that we 've developed at food bank did you know that food bank wa is the state 's largest food relief organization and it provides over 6 million meals to families and people in need in geraldton we rely on rescued and donated products that would otherwise go to landfill and food insecurity as you probably know and are aware is increasing at the moment so we do rely on fundraising and to purchase the food to provide to these families and charities so today we 're going to be cooking our crazy corn dip and it comes from our healthy recipes for all one of these books that we develop for our food sensation for adult program that is currently funded by department of health so this is the recipe we 'll be cooking our food sensations for adult program is a program that runs for four weeks it 's a free program and it two and half hour sessions where we talk about nutrition and then we go in the kitchen to cook all together because of the current covin 19 at the moment we have put our program online so you are welcome to join us for a food sensation for adult online so let 's get cooking or put my apron on i 've washed my hands so we 're ready to get in our kitchen so our dip will need some veggie sticks and the veggies have already been pre-cut and i have also a carrot here to keep on chopping so what i normally do when i cut i always put the flat part on the board so it doesn 't roll and there 's less chance of cutting your fingers because you see that be easy to cut and then i add to my little sticks with my cucumber to make it pretty i normally just cut a little bit of the peel i try to keep the peel because it 's full of dietary fiber and it 's really healthy my veggies also have lots of vitamins and and to make my dip i need a bowl i will be using yogurt and cream cheese instead of sour cream so the idea behind that is to make sure that i have plenty of calcium and proteins instead of the fat the saturated fat that i would need normally in i would have normally in my mayonnaise or my sour cream so i will put one cup of my yogurt in my bowl and don 't be shy to use plenty of yogurt natural yogurt that 's why i don 't have all the added sugar that flavored yogurt would have and i need about half a packet of that cream cheese and i 've chosen the light one so i cut back a little bit on the fat content i need 125 gram of that cream cheese so that 's roughly half of this packet because that was 250 grams giving me a bit of trouble here there we go okay and then the idea is to mix it nicely so it 's nice and smooth and once i 've done that i can then add my quarter you can always choose the no added salt to it that 's about a quarter of a cup and i 've already drained the water to speed up the recipe so i 've put my corn in and i 'll put a little bit of corn relish that i 've got gotten at the shop this morning about a third of a cup and i 'll add that up so pretty simple and really tasty and then i put a little bit of my sweet chili sauce about an eighth of a cup so that 'd be half a quarter of a cup and all mix that together and then to make it even yummier i will add a little bit of shallots or chives to my dip and i will also add some garlic so just be careful in this here because sometimes the knife might slips and you might end up chopping fingers which is not great having a trip to the hospital and there is my garlic really finely chopped once again and give it a good stir to mix all the flavors through and now i a great way to increase your veggie intake did you know that we need about five serves a day so a serve is um either a cup of raw veggies so the way i normally explain it is that a cup would be my two hands together of raw veggies so about a bit less than that or half a cup of cooked veggies so that would be a serve so if i 'm thinking that i 'm gonna have veggies with a dip as a snack that 's a great way to increase my veggies in my diet today so i 'm putting my carrot sticks my celery and i 've also chopped up some cucumber you could put some capsicum to put a bit of red or a little bit of tomatoes so a rainbow here in my plate and i 'm gonna put a little bit of crackers not too many because i really want to stick to the veggies and there 's my little dip here made today for you the crazy corn dip as i said and you have it here in our healthy recipes at org dot or you can do a food sensation for adult search and that 's going to also take you to our website so i encourage you to add extra veggies to your day by having some dips by having them in the morning as well if you 're having eggs instead of bacon you could have mushrooms or tomatoes have a garden salad on the side of your plate so for example if you have a plight make sure that you put lots of veg half of your plight should have those veggies either cooked or raw and then a little bit of your carbs a little bit of real protein food by the way this flight comes in our resource kit that people will get at the end of the three weeks program or online or the four weeks program face to face when it comes back to that that 's all for now but please stay tuned for more to come and from myself and the food bank team please stay safe stay healthy and stay connected we 'll see you next time _"

    "text": "[Music] beautiful thank you on that lovely note i 'm rosie and welcome to qpt time uh that is a working title we haven 't yet kind of set on a good name maybe another pun maybe you 'd like to suggest a good name for us and this format which is just some good old chats a good a good yarn with some of our local characters and musicians artists people of note of no note at all um i think that at the note of always what i 'm most interested in why are people interesting um i don 't know but our first very interesting person that we 're going to talk to is a geraldton local and it 's darcy hay hello hello how good is darcy you might have seen him around town playing gigs um darcy i think actually was also a cadet at the paper for a few years yes i did my stint at the jolton guardian and the northern guardian yeah right so he 's only young but he 's already had this great life and i 'm hoping that we we 're going to talk a bit about darcy the man behind the music and of course enjoy some of this beautiful instrument we 've got before us so maybe let 's start you know we 've i 've said that you 're a man of many talents but how did you how did you end up in geraldton born here that 's very easy yes it was probably one of the easiest things that i 've done from from what i can recollect which is not an awful lot um yeah born up here at the regional hospital and have pretty well spent my entire life up here besides resting in canaan working for the paper and then karatha a couple of years ago but i always get drawn back to geraldton yeah you hear that a lot don 't you people you do you do people try and leave geraldton and and then you know they 're always coming back and there 's a few different pull factors i think for a lot of people it may be the family connections or just the sheer size geraldine 's too small and not too far from perth yeah that 's nice isn 't it i i first came up to geraldton in 2012 and then i came up again in 2013 and i was going to be here just for six weeks and sort of a couple years later i 'm still here um and i think that 's one of the the common themes of this place is that people people are drawn to it you know for whatever reason and they stay here for a whole different range of reasons why do you stay here family is one big reason it 's a little bit hard to leave my dogs behind i was trying to go anywhere else i 'm so glad that you think like that like some people don 't think that dogs are family and i will actively fight those people no i probably would fight them by your side one of the more important members of the family to consider because they can 't understand the reasoning if you 've got parents or children or someone like that so you might have to the chance to explain to them in some kind of logical term why it is that you 're going in that you 'll be back at a certain time but for a dog you can 't get that through to them and it can be very damaging to them which i found when i worked away up north it was not a very good thing my beautiful little boy i just like everything else aside i feel like we 've just really connected on a dog level i mean you can see from my jumper i 'm a bit of an animal fan and have been talking about starting an animal rescue farm in my retirement years but this is about you not me so you we know why you 're saying geraldton but what so you grew up in jerusalem you went to school yeah that 's right children primary school and yeah and you went to the just the senior high school no i got a scholarship to grammar school oh yeah oh fancy yeah he 's a fancy boy darcy and did you were you a musician started playing guitar probably when i was about 10 or 11 so back in primary school is a story that i do like to tell a little bit uh nicked my sister 's guitar essentially she was taking lessons up at the uh john walcock as it was called back then and she had one of those little a4 sort of books filled with tablature exercises and that kind of thing from memory she wasn 't particularly dedicated but i i wanted to be a guitarist for whatever reason and so i sort of used to liberate that book every now and then when she wasn 't around knowing that she 'd get a little bit jealous if she knew that i was poaching a book and teaching myself up on guitar so after i suppose six months of sneakily learning the guitar from this book i was discovered and much to my delight and enduring uh enduring plus yes gratitude yes i 've um my parents didn 't punish me for it he said i would uh probably better get him a little guitar and let him learn it about learning yeah my sister probably wasn 't too pleased about that but she came to reconcile herself with the idea and from there yeah from about the age of 10 or so it 's just been one of those labels of love that i can 't get away from yeah during high school i played a fair old bit a few little assembly gigs and that kind of thing yeah and started writing again in high school as well yeah cool and did you ever get any lessons at all i had lessons for a little while from a blog called frank connor who i think a lot of guitarists and geraldton owe a fair bit too old frank but um largely just sort of by ear you know fumbling around and seeing what works and what definitely doesn 't work yeah and so some of those high school gigs like at assemblies like were you accompanying people were you just like sitting there playing solo i can only ever recall playing solo wow gosh i don 't think i 've ever met a teenager who was like yeah like play something like guitar what did you play like blues or it was an instrumental piece so one piece that i can really remember was an instrumental piece sort of probably modeled on my love of progressive metal at the time actually tool was a song sort of in the vein of tool wow yeah vaguely sort of arabic piece with the scales that i was using and that yeah right i can 't recall the name but i do recall that it was a fairly can you still play it sort of i think it revolved around this sort of thing and then something sort of vaguely like that i wish i had been in those assemblies and just been like watch that it must have been like were you ever nervous oh yeah so i 'm nervous all the time with music i 'm very nervous before coming down here um no that 's something that i don 't think will ever leave me and a lot of museo seem to have that problem too yeah sort of a bit of negative self-talk before you get on of that trepidation sort of washing away in the moment of being there a bit of a bit of a thing where you 're in the moment you can 't run so you just sort of groove with it yeah that 's a good way of looking at it that 's nice and so you you 've come to music but did you did you get into music straight out of school oh yeah actually during school i was a guitar teacher we had to do work experience in year 10 i think and i was lucky enough to jag opus music so a week of doing a little bit of work down there and by the end of it ash collins had given me a job teaching guitar after school at that stage and then for little while after i finished school too doing tuition with people right from you know kids sort of five or six that kind of thing up to one bloke i remember quite fondly who was about 80 years old wow it was very satisfying there 's something quite eternally gratifying about seeing the they 've been laboring over for quite some time they get it down pat and the feeling of accomplishment that they seem to exude when they 've got it as though all of that practice has paid off and they 've sort of broken through a barrier and the joy that they have is a remarkable remarkable thing it 's very very potent to sit back and see see them so happy with themselves yeah i want to jump a little bit to to what you 've done outside of music because i think that that what i know of you as an artist that life actually informs a lot of your writing um and so we talked a bit about you going to the paper was that the first thing that you sort of did after school i did a bit of work as a waiter of all things which i wasn 't very good at at the boat shed restaurants oh i 'm trying of course i did a paper run when i was a kid yep other than that sits yeah it was pretty well straight down i was just dropping off resumes to every business around i dropped off a resume to the guardian saying i 'll mow your lawns i 'll do whatever you need me to do for a little bit of cash i 'm desperate for a job and they um i forget how they had heard of me possibly through music but that was a bit of a foot in the door that i thought oh he 's a songwriter so he knows his way around words yeah so from that i started off writing of all things football articles i 'm terrible with football i 'm not a person who follows it too closely or has much of an idea of what 's going on but nonetheless they dispatched me out to do a few weekend games and from there that was my foot in the door with sports writing of all things and then yeah into a little bit of entertainment writing which suited me a lot better when sophie elliot the juno there who 's now down south she um went away for two weeks holiday they put me entertainment stuff speaking to different artists and that was right up my alley i enjoyed that very much then from there it led to your job yeah yeah and so writing at the paper or working the paper did you why didn 't you stay there i guess is my question it was funnily enough quite a bit to do with my dogs i was up in carnarvon at the time as i say working right up until december 2014 as essentially the soldier we had a contributor branwyn from exmouth who would send in quite a few articles which was very valuable it would have been very difficult to cover exmouth as well as carnarvon but the science for her was sort of a one-man show thing taking all the photos trying to get the paper together by yourself each week with the help of the sub editors and the editor and that kind of thing and by the end of that the stress are built up a little bit for myself and trying to maintain those deadlines getting a paper out without fail every single week but more away to nothing you know i lost a lot of weight and didn 't have much enjoyment of life anymore and the guilt from that in turn made me a bit sick myself um yeah i started just feeling quite quite unwell being up there and decided oh it 's probably probably time to quit this and move on to something else so one of the things that you 're going to sing for us today is about your dogs is that right that 's right it 's about my beautiful boy treacle the fourth who died a little while ago now yeah well maybe we might hear that song and then we 'll come back and chat just a little bit yeah sure thing sure thing all right this is a song of my own devising called sleeping dogs about my beautiful boy trickle iv who passed away coming up to two two years ago i believe and this is in honour of his memory [Music] so thought i heard the tapping chatter off your feet outside my doorway today i hear dogs barking down the streets i see keep thinking you 're coming home awake one morning and find the nightmares flying but i wake up every morning alone [Music] it 's quite without you it 's cold at night without you by my side and it hurts to land sleeping dogs like [Music] we both drift like ghosts through this house there is town that we used to own i hear your sounds i 'll see you around in the shadows where the mellow plucker grows apart staying strong haven hearts steady song what 's the difference when either way you 're gone [Music] it 's quite without you it 's cold at night it 's without you by my side and it 's quiet without you yes i miss you little child in the sky and it hurts to let 's sleep in dark slide thank you it 's just beautiful to us thank you so much thank you what 's the name of that song it 's just called sleeping dogs yeah i think that 's something that i think a lot a lot of people can you know can find relatable is not necessarily it is a sad reality that comes to anyone who wants an animal that eventually there is an end to that deep friendship well your dogs are lucky that they 've got someone who can memorialize them so beautifully um and and carry that legacy forward and it 's important to me to do so as well i mean i loved that boy just like a son so there 's a chance to sort of keep his memory and his name alive it 's one that i do like to take advantage of that 's beautiful and i think it 's important as a musician to be talking about the things that you care about in life right i mean it 's my personal view but but do you do you find that is your music about those things or is it do you sort of write more frivolously oh inevitably it 's about the things that i care about um to the point of possibly shooting myself in the foot a little bit you know by sort of being too introspective and that kind of thing but it 's take any pleasure out of writing music if there wasn 't some kind of deep connection to what i was trying to communicate because to me that 's the point of music is communication even if nobody 's listening it 's trying to get something out of yourself yeah out into the world it 's very much a means of expression and communication and it wouldn 't be true to that ethos if you were to write and sing about things that you had very little care for just to try to sort of fulfill the trends of the market all that kind of thing it 's not a compromise that i 'd want to see myself make so what are some of those things that you care about then oh just a short list obviously i 've always had a fixation for standing up for the underdog yeah so a fair bit of the music you could call political or socially conscious that kind of thing those themes do come out a bit there 's the old self-expression thing feeling bad feeling good that kind of thing trying to is certainly one thing that i 've my first passion actually would have been nature david attenborough was my hero as a child and this passion has been enduring so quite i 'm not going to say often or as often as i 'd like but with some frequency nature pops up as a theme for me to write about yeah and to think about um and stories too are supposed to be one thing telling a bit of a narrative tale about different stories historical events that kind of thing things that i 'd like to think a worthy of encapsulation in song i have this great memory back in 2018 when we were at blues of the bush and you actually played there at least the bush i did i enjoyed it very very much and when we we sort of were having this conversation around the the camp you know about where we were and jokingly said that we were all i think that the sign said we 're on mallee fowl lane and we jokingly suggested that you should write a song called mallee fowl lane um i particularly remember it because it 's so out of character for me to actually run with a suggestion that i 'm different most of the time if people say oh you should write a song about this i it 's almost like a instinctive reaction to the body oh i 've been asked to write about this so no i won 't but in this particular case um it came to me quite naturally to write a song about melee foul elaine just about the good companionship that we had out there and some of the more memorable incidents like that bloke you might remember who was not having a very nice time about three o 'clock in the morning yeah it 's always the time of night when things go badly so i can i can sympathize with that and the thing i remember about that song is that it was so much rooted in that experience of nature out there at blues of the bush and it 's something that i 've sort of noticed not just in your music but also in in your sort revealing itself in your writing and in your music and you know you 're an avid bird watcher um you know a lot more about birds than i 'll ever know in my whole life um what is it about nature that you think comes so naturally to your writing i suppose it gives you a sense of place if you 're aware of the birds around you the insects for plant species that kind of thing it gives you a certain grounding in your surroundings that i suppose helps you to feel as a person a bit more grounded in yourself to be sort of a somewhat attuned to your surroundings and such but it 's a good question i 've had a few people now say oh why is it what is so interesting about birds or nature that would make you pursue it so doggedly i mean they 're just trees they 're just birds that kind of thing um and i wish i did have a more comprehensive answer about it but i think it does get back to just feeling at home if you know within yourself and i see i 'm interested now in how your your love of nature and you know that you clearly show through your music and that sort of ideal of you know standing up for the underdog how those two things come together because i know that the second song you 're going to play for us is sort of about the interplay of those things it is somewhat yeah yeah yeah can you give us a bit of a background of how you know do you see nature as an underdog too often yes i mean ultimately it will have the last life i suppose nature 's got a tremendous capacity to heal itself after some pretty pretty gnarly things that happen to us but yes animals don 't have anyone to speak up for them and when they do have people try to bridge that gulf and try to put the perspective of suffering ecosystems and animal species forward it 's not necessarily one that is listened to it 's often shunted off to the side that kind of thing is being less important than human been here before humans have a rocked up have got just as much right to be here as what we do and it is certainly an underdog situation i think a lot of the time and i think that your music does a great job of giving voice to those issues and those creatures and you know it 's lovely to have someone like you in in this place in geraldton um and maybe we can as opposed to trying to talk too much about the music we can just kind of let the music speak for itself um with this song if you if you want to give a bit of an intro you can sure thing i um struggled to give an intro to be honest because like so many of my songs that just sort of came out of the ether with little rhyme or reason to it as such but the back story for want of a better word would be that i live in beach lands quite close to the port and quite often you hear those trains going past you hear them sounding that one sleepless night where i was up and hearing that train blare out that long night and it just got me sort of thinking about i suppose similarities between that train and the the emptiness that it must feel when when it 's loaded of all of its cargo and goes straight back out to do the same old trip all over and over again that 's what i was sort of feeling at the time a bit sort of sad and that kind of thing and the words came of their own accord i called it carrara not particularly because of that individual mining company it was just a nicer title than say guendouzi or mount gibson or something but um yeah and there is a reserve too nature reserve out there which i suppose gives it a little bit of extra credence as such but it seemed like a nice title and the trains had themselves pretty firmly embedded in my mind that night and so from that came this song i think this is a really beautiful way to end our chat darcy you know that this and the things you care about and thank you so much thank you very much for having me on the first episode of quarantine time or qbt time whatever our final title will be um so this is carrara thank you darcy thank you for having me all right shall i just get stuck into it now yeah [Music] do trying bringing borders breaking hearts am i i can mind bright squares are screaming sparks dying on the cold rail line [Music] not rest nila [Music] rust on my eyeballs scratches like a rotten wobble in two worry chokes a nightfall hurtin like a stone in my shoe sometimes i feel like nothing i fear is true [Music] do head engine towing carriages going down to ports it 's been a long night hauling hematites and iron ore [Music] no dirts no trees anymore [Music] taylor since i felt useful strong or satisfied the air is so heavy now it 's mother 's the tinder and the fire sometimes i feel the best parts of me have died [Music] try and carry on your numbing blowing some rats until they no hope no fear just homewood down no hope no fear just homewood thank you _"

    "text": "oh hey guys we 're the gardening grubs this is a maritime guy and we are going to talk about some creative ways of getting food plants from the food that you weight funny enough food plants and food are pretty much the same thing now I 've there 's there 's been a shortage of seeds and stuff and everyone 's been raiding the the nurseries ins things it 's not much around but everyone wants to get into the ground so just remember food comes from plants and generally the food reading is the plant 's method to create more of itself more food so remember this thing this is a tomato it 's full of really nice for flesh that we eat and returning the sauces and things and my lovely assistant here is a Mia is going to chop a tomato in half and we 're gonna see what 's inside can you chop that tomato in half same whoa there we go alright I 'm gonna bring this up to the camera a bit closer there see in here these are the tomato seeds it a tomato grows so what we 're going to do is we 're going to chop that tomato again can you drop that again for us in we 're going to scrape these seeds out onto a bit of cardboard pretty easy you can do it any old how you can just scoop them out with your fingers they come out a bit wet and juicy but that 's the joy of a tomato here you go yep and you can get so many seeds from this tomato it 's a crazy amazing process this plant has of making sure there 's cousins and brothers and sisters and everything that it can grow with and we put them on a bit of um we 're putting it on a bit of cardboard here just to soak up a bit of that moisture because there 's quite a lot of it and you kind of want your seeds to dry out a bit so you can handle them a bit better and then you can um then you can store them for a little bit longer or you could just chuck is another lovely luscious red fruit what 's this one called dead caps you can and yes we can with the caps you can so we 're going to I 'm gonna ask you ask you to can you chop that up for me and then have your tomato oh look at those knife skills well this caps a can is pretty much a caps account it doesn 't really have many seeds but sometimes you have capsicum they got tons and tons and tons and tons and tons of seed sometimes it 's like more seed than capsicum where 's the capsicum eat injuries seeds and they don 't taste as good as the capsicum that 's for sure but anyway we 've got a few of these seeds here you know you don 't need too many capsicum plants because they they can take up a bit of space so maybe we 've just got the right amount of caps concedes there anyway capsicum so good for it 's got more vitamin C than an orange from what I 've been reading anyway so there we go we of caps of concedes as you can see and heaps and heaps of tomato seeds never just leave that in the Sun no cost no trip to the shops or anything like that and the chances are that 's that 's like that 's potential there okay that 's a real simple one to do and the next thing we 'll go through is ginger you know gingers gingers are real good medicinal medicinal and flavorsome root it 's a rhizome and the amazing thing about ginger is that it just grows from the ginger bulb you can just get this and find the little nodules in there and shuck them in a nice bit of potting mix give it a good water they like to remain a bit moist and stuff and then um you can basically grow your own ginger from a piece of ginger and the funny thing is you can chop them up into little bits and you can grow to ginger plants from that same piece of ginger amazing you can do the same with turmeric and all kinds of other things so good I abscess in my tooth ones oh good all right antibiotics didn 't do it ginger did it just popped it out and anyway enough about me what 's this one Sam this one 's fennel that 's a favorite for my um co-hosts here she likes just eating it like this and grows crazy right sometimes you got too much metal everywhere anyway shuck this one in a pot of water and we 're doing that or we 'll show you how this is the bottom part of a lettuce that 's crazy but these things this is a what 's this one 's in celery these things will sprout roots if left in water and they will grow just like the tops of a beetroot this is a tiny bit we 've chopped this one up into tiny little bit this one is a parsnip and I 'm sure everyone knows what this one is that 's a fancy hat yes porn Apple and these things if you pop them in without this one going in a bit of water and it 's just looking after itself we 've look do you want to empty that as a bit of water into there pour a bit of water in so that 's it you just pop a little bit of water into your um into a bowl or something or if you haven 't got a bowl you can always use an old milk carton or a cup or any sort of thing that 'll hold a bit of water pop it in hey presto and that doesn 't that it looks it looks amazing to you can you don 't even need to pop it in the ground later on when it 's got roots you can just leave it in that and it make you look your kitchen look wonderful anyway so put the celery and put the lettuce and we 'll put the fennel inside another little vessel here this was just from the bottom of a milk container do I need to spend any money and pop it on the same shelf with the with the pineapple now I know another another favorite everyone has is avocado and growing an avocado tree is a very get yourself a jar you fill your jar up with water and this one I 've prepared earlier but basically I just got a stick from the snap to stick off a tree and I got my my um co-host here Sam to whittle away make a little pointy tip on it very easy we made three of those and we chucked them into the chuck them into the pip of the avocado and we 're just hanging that so the base of it is just touching in the water and you just keep an eye on that and leave it on the same shelf for a bit of time and nature will do its thing it 'll it 'll shoot out a little root and then before you know it it 'll crack open and you 'll have some leaves popping out and you 've got your own very own avocado tree and you know what some of your culinary herbs like your fennel and you come in your cumin come in whatever whatever you want to call it tastes the same tastes great why not even try and you chuck it in why don 't you pop them in and soak them in a little bit of water oh you can even do it in the same jar that the avocados in so come in there overnight and then you could just broadcast them around your garden or you could dig the little holes and put a little seed in each hole whatever your gig is let 's just give it a shot there 's no reason we can 't_''_558.91 be growing food just because the shops are out of seeds all right cool thank you very much where the garden grubs have a lovely time _"

but you want to make sure that this is either a hundred percent cotton or a hundred percent bamboo any natural fiber will be perfect we want to really be avoiding things like polyester viscose any synthetic fabrics because the dye just won 't take is good to that sort of fabric you need to make sure if you 've bought a new piece of clothing just give it a run through the washing machine because the dye also won 't take as well just because there are chemicals on the outside of the fabric so we 'll want to make sure that we wash that out and also before we of clothing is damp so not soaking wet wring it out because when we 're folding it 's best to use damp clothing especially for that day to really take to the fabric which is what we 're looking for next hour we 're gonna use rubber bands so if you can get a pack that 's got lots of different sizes I 've got some nice big thick ones and some finer ones which will make really cool circles hopefully today you obviously are going to need a pack of dye for tie-dye today I 'm using indigo just because I love the color and I wanted to use one single block color but there are lots of different packs with rainbows and things like that with the tie-dye dye packs they come in two forms you can either add the dye to a bucket of water which is what we 're going to be doing today or the dye comes in a pack with lots of little bottles so you 'd use one color per bottle and that particular tie-dye in style is awesome if you want to the bottle to pour onto your design and kind of mix colors as you like whereas the bucket is is easier if you 're using one tone or dip dyeing in that pack of tie-dye usually there 's something called soda ash basically that 's just like a binding agent and it helps the dye really take to the fabric it usually comes in a pack with your tie-dye anyways we want a spoon for mixing really important or I mean you don 't have to use a spoon you can use a stick if you want to but if you are using a spoon just make sure that it does not go back into the kitchen because what we use for dyeing we do not want to use for cooking afterwards so if you are tied a with your kids just be mindful that this spoon does not go back into the kitchen for cooking or steering really important that one my next up some gloves you do want to get some gloves because your hands will get dyed also worth noting that if you were tie dyeing at an apron or something because dye sticks particularly if you were in cotton and it 's really easy to splash it onto yourself so that 's kind of a run-through of the basics that you need so first up to get started I am gonna start with the dye just so that it 's got some time to sit in the water and while that 's sitting we 'll do some folds and some patterns and things and I 'll run you through our design for today it 's not too complicated so stick with me so first up we are gonna add indigo to our bucket of water I 've just got an average-sized bucket of water we 're gonna tip that straight and you can see it 's just mixing beautifully in there next I know on some videos it says just soak the fabric in soda ash beforehand but if you 're just kind of doing this for fun and you 're not getting too serious into it then I 'll just go ahead and like add the photo ash in with the dye and this is fully splashed out so you will get dye on on yourself just FYI taking my spoon now and I 'm just going to gently like Mick the dye in with the binding agents and then a so I was just gonna do that for a couple of minutes just to get everything mixed in beautifully in that water and once that is done we just kind of let that sit for a bit so if you 're using you don 't have to necessarily be using indigo if you 're using a different dye you just mix that in it may already have the soy in the dialect mixes together I know that I think a spotlight cell those sorts of dyes where you just took the whole packet in perfect easy-peasy cool so that 's mixed pretty well just going to go the counter direction and make sure that the bits in the sediment at the bottom have mixed in and then I 'm gonna lift the spoon out and just let that sit yeah I do we want to let the dye kind of sit and settle for it does to fold your design and your NGO t-shirt or your fabric so it works out in the end don 't get too crazy about it so for this pattern in particular I 'm sort of winging it and hoping for the best but we 're gonna start with a bit of a zigzag fold in the corner and hopefully what that will look like in the end is some cool streaks and the fabric with the dye sort of in and out of those folds so we 're gonna start at the bottom left corner folding that little corner up and then just zigzagging you can kind of play around with the width of the fold I 'm just kind of going and you know write that much of my finger what 's that like an inch I guess and we 're just gonna keep folding all the way through so I 'm making sure that that fabric is like nice and flat at each fold and really folded well because it 's going to give us a really cool pattern so you just go ahead and do like the middle line of the t-shirt because I 'm hoping that it will create like a bit of a semicircle design I guess the beauty of folding it and playing around with the designers like tie-dye is so forgiving you can have a pretty average design but it will still look cool because the dye has a way of working through the folds and if you 're using rubber bands through the rubber bands where they 've blocked the dive going into the fabric so you should be right so as you can see there are some cool fall it 's being created in my fabric you can kind of see if I turn on the side there you can kind of see the ribbons that I 've created so I 'm probably going to call it there that looks about right for me I 've gone up to about halfway in my t-shirt so now I am going to grab a big rubber band and I 'm going to start with the center point is where I started the fold here and I 'm just gonna pinch it tie this first section with a big rubber band now really important to note that when you are tying with rubber bands they need to be super tight so you don 't really want to be able to like see the fabric underneath it 's got to be so tight that you can hardly push it along if you know what I mean like a few it to do this it should be hard to do we really want to be blocking this section and the fabric so that the dye can 't get through there and we can start to create a really cool pattern it 's a surf first point you can even if you feel like that 's not tight enough you could even go over with a second rubber band really so now I 'm just gonna go along again make sure that my folds are still pretty good I mean yep they 're looking pretty good to me it 's now gonna go along again and I 'm going to fold us or use my rubber band to create another stop around here a little it 's about Raph it will look awesome once the dye has soaked through perfect I 'm gonna go over the second just because I want that second one to be really tight and I couldn 't get a good grip on that first band so as you can see I 've got two stops there and pretty much I 'm just going to go along and pop a couple more up towards the sleeves of the shirt just being mindful not to actually put a rubber band over the sleeves perfect dose_._599.869 so we still have created folds they 're just being bunched in it 's getting a little bit wild in there now but that 's pretty much what you 're aiming for as we go along couple more I might Chuck maybe two more in there and the cool thing about the rubber bands is that they are going to start creating circles and our pattern and our sleeves here in here so might go maybe a smaller rubber band this time and I might need to do two of those just because they 're so fine a bit more flimsy so this is just my design but you know if you wanted more or less rubber bands that you just go ahead and do what you want to do it 's all good and that 's the beauty of it you know you can get as creative as you want to if you want to do just one rubber band perfect there are some really cool techniques as well you know if you want to create circles and inside of circles inside of circles you can grab things around the house like a rock you can stick the rock into the fabric and then loop a rubber band on the outside of the fabric around the rock and it will create some really cool interesting shapes I know that I didn 't really have any interesting things to use when I was tidying once and I just got things like connectors on the garden hose and like whatever I had around like a spoon you know and you could just try that around with rubber bands and it creates some really quick really interesting shapes so I think that will look good yeah lastly I just thought I 'd play around with a little twist at the back of the neck because most about our design is along the bottom of the t-shirt so I thought maybe just to add a little detail near the neckline at the back of the shirt would be kind of cool but you know I 'm also experimenting here so these are all of our circles that we 've created with rubber bands so I mean your t-shirt should sort of look like this but if it doesn 't that 's fine just kind of go with it you never know you might create something really awesome by breaking the rules you know a bit of creative license it 's like I said I 'm just gonna do that last little bit so I 'm going to find the back of the t-shirt here are my two sleeves I 've made sure not to to fold them I 'm going to grab the back of the t-shirt here I 'm gonna pinch it and then twist the fabric around that back of the shirt there so in doing this similar to the fold that we 've just created you know where we have like we 're folding the fabric so that the dye can 't get into those creases the same kind of principle with a twist except it just is a bit of a different design so I 've pinched the center I 've twisted the fabric around and hopefully I 've created a bit of a spiral here so I 'm just gonna take another rubber band pinch this whole spiral and then wrap my rubber band around the spiral and by rights I should have a cool spiral that I may not will see perfect all right so we have our spiral at the back our sleeves and we 've got our different circle points I might just pop this a little bit in there a bit more looks great perfect we are ready for dyeing so I 'm just gonna go back to my bucket give this a little bit of a stir it 's been sitting for long enough I 'd say so it 's all right this is where you need to put your apron on and you need to put your gloves on because it 's gonna get messy particularly if you have a tie-dye kit that uses bottles because those bottles are wild though just like spray everywhere even if you 're being really careful so I would not wear your favourite clothes I also would just avoid wearing white if you 're dying just in general rule of thumb even just like getting created just don 't wear white unless you want like quickie dye everywhere then yeah totally we 're like cool guys so we are going to essentially just plug this in I 've got a little container here that I 'm gonna pop this in and I 'll explain after this is not sponsored by ice cream by the way it 's just a good date I 've got laying around so we 're gonna take this whole t-shirt gloves on apron on and we 're gonna dunk it into the dye I might even just move this along so you can really see I 'm doing here and we need to hold this in for about maybe two minutes so I 'm just I 'm holding on to her I 'm just kind of swirling it around the bucket making sure it 's submerged in the water but not necessarily letting it go to the bottom of the bucket because the pigment can sometimes rest at the bottom of the bucket which can create splotches and things like that in your dye which again looks kind of cool but if you 're not looking for that kind of design and then I would avoid dropping the dye in so we 're using indigo if this were any other pigment like terracotta or something cool like that you just swirl it around but what makes indigo really interesting and fun as a creative project is once you submerge it in the water it is sort of this like a yellowy green but once it is brought out of the water it starts to oxidize and that 's when it turns blue so you can pretty much watch this indigo change color in front of your eyes it 's 's say minutes when it 's in the bucket you kind of need to squeeze any air out of the fabric as you 've put it into the water just to make sure that that dye is really getting in and around all of the crevices of the shirt perfect so I 'm just kind of squeezing any arrivals out really getting that dye into all of the folds and I think that 's just about ready so you can kind of see I 'm bringing it out it 's like a light green color but just watch so that 's like the really cool thing about indigo is that it has this awesome effect once you 've taken it out of the dye bucket it 's changing color colors in front of you which other dyes don 't really do you know they turn the color in the bucket and when you take them out that 's sort of it so generally with other dyes you you can resubmit the item back into the dye if you want a darker pigment or if you 've got multiple things you need those items to sit overnight so for about 24 hours let them dry out so give them a squeeze in the dye and then put them out somewhere to dry you can put them into a plastic bag and just let them dry together in there and that just helps that color to set but from experience do not put multiple items into the same bag if they are different colors because they will start to change color and mix with other colors but if you 're dyeing everything the same color from the same bucket then check them all into the same plastic bag and let them just develop their color and the next day you will be ready to remove those rubber bands and to give them a call rinse of water and all those sorts of things which I 'll talk to you about next so with the indigo you can kind of see that it 's starting to turn blue and this takes about 20 minutes so particularly with indigo if that 's what you 're using in 20 minutes time we are going to luscious dark blue color but you need to give it some time for that oxidation process to really happen and for that pigment to really come through the fabric so 20 minutes time we 're going to dunk that back into the bowl and let that sit for a further 20 minutes and once that process is over this is when you need to put your bucket away if you 're going to reuse it it can last for a couple of further days otherwise we are going to run this piece of fabric under cool water until the dye starts just turn clear so the water that runs off the t-shirt begins to change from super dark dye to a little bit more like water once they 're at that process we are ready to remove our rubber bands and then check our item into the wash so that 's what we 're gonna do now fortunately I am super fluid so I have dyed this same design last night and we are ready pretty much to reveal what this is going to look like so I 'm gonna bit so as you can see here this is a design with all of our rubber bands and things like that this is essentially after two dies it 's come out really beautifully blue it was originally the same t-shirt it went through the same green to blue process but if you have a look here you can even see that just over this past what 5-10 minutes it 's really starting to take take how is 't super cool really interesting so this I have died twice I 've let it sit I 've rinsed it with cold water until the water turned clear and now we are ready to remove the rubber bands so I 'm gonna be gutted if this doesn 't come out properly but so you can see how I 've really doubled up yay look at that we 're gonna have a design guys so I 'm feeling really chuffed so yeah super-important colors that you have made sure you have after you finish dyeing you 've just rinsed this before taking the rubber bands off you have rinsed this item until the water you 're gonna get dye on yourself and it 's gonna stain and also if you chuck it into the wash it 's gonna could get dye on everything just snapped a rubber band and that 's gonna happen just go with it cool sorry we just need to take all these rubber bands off and sometimes by a hard work but it 's gonna be worth it I can already feel that this is going to be a successful project so I 'm glad that if you followed this design it 's gonna be good and most importantly it 's gonna be something that you actually want to wear almost there oh this I guess this is like the catcher using so many rubber bands you know is that you got to take them off and some dye kits like I said you let them sit for 24 hours and the the rubber bands can get super crusty they 're pretty much just snapping when they come off anyways but if you can try and preserve them because you know you only really need to buy one pack of going and like I said with the dye it can last in that bucket for a couple of further days so if you find out the clothes around the house that you want to try to even sheets can be really cool pillowcases I 've tied oh my baby 's clothing just for something different you can reuse that dye yeah for so so many more items and if you 're using bottles and not a bucket they the dye can still sit in the bottles and you can dilute the dye you can stretch it further so once that dye kind of gets to a quarter of the way down and you can top it up with water and just start to dilute the color see your stool if you use blue for example you 'll still get blue items they might just be sky-blue or really light blue by the end of it you know oh my gosh check this out okay so we have just removed all of our rubber bands lots of the net and this is our tie-dyed shirt epic I 'm just looking at with that what you guys can do it I forgot a one hang on here the back of the neck you know how we did that twirl the spiral let 's see if they 're even worse epic yeah and if you have a tie-dye kit that has lots of different colors like imagine how cool this design would be if you you know poured a bit of yellow and blue and got greens or you did you know reds in there and created oranges like you could just go wild with this thing such a cool school holiday project that also just like fun cheap activity that you can do at home to kind of repurpose old clothing check out the spiral look I 'm pretty stoked with us in all honesty I think that it 's turned out wicked so that 's pretty much it for me you have learnt how to tie-dye and if you can use indigo you 've Lynch tie-dye with indigo but if you 're using rainbows I mean you could just go wild and why not you know tag the city and let have been doing so make sure that you if you have watched this and you are gonna tie-dye like send us a pic in the comments and show us what you 've been up to we 'd love to see I 'd love to see if you did it successfully that 's pretty much it for me thanks for watching CTD TV guys I 'm Alexia _"

    "text": "hi guys how are you today this is sha Shan Jackie I can shout our studio so I welcome to CGG TV 2020 all right clover 19 maybe I don 't know ok today we are we are doing drawings that are love doing you know pop culture the Fila culture street culture always things in between so today I reckon we have the Jura vibe of course with the ocean and all that marine life so I guess we could choose I could choose Aquaman so I 've got I 've got a picture of him on my phone here then I 'll do a shark and the and the writing will be CGG so what i 'm doing here is pretty much focusing on afridi font and caricatures and pretty much themes in between that you know so working on the same guys is important having a thought sort out having on a piece of paper so drawing is a must just hours and hours of drawing and practicing at home which you should be anyway is ideal at this time just practicing your craft knowing what 's these these things these textures you can see that their kids Texas but I love these textures because they 're they got the tip which could color really quick and just a usual posture and aquascaping permanent marker a pencil an eraser maybe a bit of charcoal just for depth and shadow alright let 's begin so with with portraits guys if you know how to do portraits that 's good but if you don 't know in your beginner or medium kind of person let 's start with the circle so having this so cool you 're nice right away how big you want it to be so I 'll just do it this peak and if if he 's facing at you then there 's the line that goes in the middle so you know yep that 's the nose and the eyes will go both sides in the mouth in in the bottom bit so if this guy is looking on the side left or right so the lion of center of the lion will be closer to the left all right so I 'll put him 'll do the eye line and then the mouth so all these are guidelines really important to have these guidelines so I 'll do this one bit and then I 'll move on to this side I 'll do a shark so a shark I just love to actual the shape of the shark I know it 's kind of dodgy to see one when you go to the beach but just love it and this sort of sounds like my name is well shark so I just do a rough drawing there and he 's sort of having his arm out with a spray can putting a spray can or a shaving cream I don 't know something funny all right so CGG will do bubble riding it could be bubble riding it could be it could be like pointy pointy font so usually if you know how to do your graffiti fonts then it 's cool so what I 'll usually do when it comes to people with that wanting to try or wanting to know like a beginner is to just do a normal normal riding just normal riding don 't understood there so working with these these are like the backbone of of it all so knowing that okay that 's the middle of the riding so I 'm going to just kind of put big thick see there around what I just did and I 'll add other bits and pieces afterwards and it could be over could be under all that kind of stuff you know just we raise the writing again when it comes to drawing you know you never sort of grow up because I love doing these I love doing posters for four schools when I was in high school my first poster was in year six or seven and that was from my teacher and I came to the posters and and all that so it was for like a fear or something and that was I still remember that okay so Aquaman he 's got the forehead here and here so I 'll do all these shapes first I might do just a bit of hair around on top of the G and sort of around yeah so just like to have screenshots of what I like to draw in my phone that 's the main thing and the love of pop culture the love of the things that I 'd like I could be a car could be characters cartoon characters you name it I love just having it stored in the phone for reference you never know it 'll be on TV like this so having having his taking shape around here the eyes so I know that I was here having a guideline is important as well guys so the eye here is bigger than the one on the further assess I whether his left and then chin so it 's mustache here lip he 's been I guess the feeling of of doing this it can be more cultured cartoon eyes or caricature but I sort of mixed it up a bit to have it more a bit more realistic but cartoony in a way where you can still sort of know who the guys alright I 'll probably have no I put his staff there but yeah having penciled everything out like that I just had that in my sketchbook so I have anchor in the middle so I have that in front of me so you know loving even tattoo culture little references of pictures yeah as a child I 'm not I love my P man and and all the eighties eighties stuff it was it was it called Joe Joe has the little toys so all them play a big part in my life now loving all that I meant my desk justice just pop culture you know he got like mystical culture and religious culture that I like doing as well all different things exploring you know bring the whole world into it in front of you having that as a reference and don 't be afraid of trying and don 't be you just give it a go with with with drawing whatever I know it 's sort of hard sometimes where you know drawing the same thing it 's ok drawing the same thing then you know exploring different things around that because there 's so much you can do you know you could just be one anchor is different change that and blah blah blah so there could be something there so alright so I 've done the outline with pencil overall and I 'll use the colors now yeah rip action there so all these elements like in in in the graffiti world as well how things pop out of a surface or like a crack or something all right we 've got having your textures your colors next to you so if you 're right-handed they have everything on your right if you left have everything on your left it 's just easier same thing with painting as well having everything on the one side if you have your water here your paints here you 're going to go like that so having everything here when your right or left is easy that 's a lesson from my old teacher back in high school so having all the tones it 's important as well if you don 't have all these tones and you 've got light and brown majority of normal texture sets in the shops so what I 'll do is to just in with this thing so I 'm just going to roughly draw whatever the colors on there and I 'll work my way on to the next one you know if there 's a white bit you leave that bit drawing the shape just like that these eyes stand out black is bit later but I 'll start with the shock you little loop okay here we go again having the right tools it could be just a cheapest thing out there this is a big surface so be mindful of how big your textures are if you 've got them thin ones and you know of course work with a smaller piece of paper because it will take a while to better read there so with CGG as well I 'll do purple so having having a line maybe to do like we 'll go across so I know I 'll have dark mid and in light or you could just have two and sometimes here when you plant something or draw something on there if something else comes up just to sort of make it easy or make one paper with texture you could continue doing these for ages practice on paper or after that you know equal work on the canvas I have to it was how I work is I like to put everything in color first wall in color on the piece of paper and then putting on a canvas or in the wall I know what what to do and what to use so there 's going to be a lot of black here can be wrong the chisel tip does help a bit as well when it comes to doing these spaces this color because this is quite effective when you 're doing big space I know if you guys seen Aquaman it 's pretty cool she started working up the Islander community Samoan and Hawaii done big murals of him they sort of had it coming I think because he was doing a lot of oceanic movies so I didn 't buy a watch or something as a young fella Atlantic Atlantis or something he didn 't have a beard in Conan the Barbarian kind of weird but uh yeah this is Craine so being you know staying at home you got to be creative if you 're that creative type if you 're not then it started with you could start being creative you know work what you have at home be creative outside inside use this space you 've got be thankful what you have but I mention that I mention skate culture as well put a bit of that in there as well building ramps or something and do that reuse recycle things so if I 'm talking to the young people out there you know you know you could say you 're bored and this and that but there 's so much into with all your health and energy that you could use work with something that 's positive so I did purple there I 'm just going to do a light purple so knowing your colors as well like your tones that 's important and again at home I use the posture pins I 've been using a lot of these textures now at home just cause they 're quick and fun and you can sort of in I guess I could draw quick and all that kind of stuff but I know when it comes to when you have the time you can just go back and redo it again so coming back to the feeding front if you 're doing bubble riding then the outside of it will be all jagged edge it 's just that you 're playing with that shape soft and hard so the writing here is is bubble writing so it 's round and soft and then I 've got these green bits that are pointy yellow I 'm just gonna leave that middle bit white okay so cray-cray worked anchor knowing dark and light where the light sources post important as well and drawing the dark space the light space where the light is shining guys just the outline real quick yeah again you know I 'm still sort of practicing finding out what do differently but keeping the same sort of style so much out there in the world you know social media YouTube and Instagram which I like going in and there 's so much tutorials about different important thing is to have everything working is off that 's a good thing as a kid my likes my trick arranged fiction man and all that kind of stuff so to see to see something in the shop like your favorite character this car almost I 'm really having it you know 3d in I mean it 's not the real thing but it 's in the flesh all the things that you 're like drawing in that 3d form as a toy or sculpture it 's kind of cool so if you want to if you 're going in that way like having two characters pop out or having to like even be movie characters as well just getting a picture of them and practicing drawing them as a character or just something that 's that 's fun to do ball means I 'm having another tone here just add that you know because we can I 'm having that crane here too just a bit more here again you can have liquid paper to do all the the white bits because it is tricky to dorm or that white wide out to just do the strands of the hair all right that 's it drawing with shop _"

    "text": "hello everyone my name is no Liguori I was born and raised in the City of Greater Jordan you 're seeing me right now on CDG TV and I would like to read some poems for you as a lot of people out there would know I am a very passionate poet I have been I have had poems published a number of poems but this one I would like to read for you today is called a miserable pittance and it 's about my my grandfather and my grandmother and the work that they did for very little or no money at all my grandmother was Stolen Generations she was taken away from the east kimberley from turkey creeks Stuart Creek Station and she was sent down to Fremantle ended up in the Swan native and half-caste home out in in middle Swan and lived there until she was about sixteen seventeen years old and then they sent her out to work so this is this poem is about her and my grandfather a miserable pittance she was paid a miserable pittance but worked her fingers to the bone her dirt floor tin Hamby home it was not an easy life for her as so many today would say the hours long and arduous but so little was she paid he would rise at the crack of dawn with Billy tea in hand this would be his only good break because he had to work the land he was paid a miserable pittance for the work that he had to do but he did not complain about it because jobs in those days were few this is my Nana and pop story and sometimes it makes me cry even though they lived a good life they struggled but they survived it breaks my heart as I read them the stories in life when life was old their money was not their own they had to do as they were and still we fight for justice to have their money repaid they work the work they did all those years ago written in history will not fade and those who are now just a memory we won 't forget what you have done the bloody hard days of working in is so funny when we walk down the street my white skin baby striding out next to me the looks that we get from those walking past when they hear her call out the shock makes us laugh she does it all the time now deliberately I must say when she gets the question in looks she just loves to have a play you will hear her call my name their faces are a blast my darling white skin baby she 's dual color cos there 's me with my dark skin proud as punch I am and beside me my young daughter she 's my number one fan and this is what she calls out for those standing near hey mummy darling can you please come here yes to those questions she is my boy look biological child I carried her for nine months all snug and warm inside she loves me her brown skin mum of this there is no doubt but it is really really funny when she calls my name out loud remembered my mother 's beautiful hands they soothed me when I cried my mother 's stinging hands they hurt when I did wrong my mother 's loving hands so warm tender and strong my daddy 's teasing voice joking and laughing around my daddy 's quiet voice barely making a sound my daddy 's beautiful voice so powerful and strong my daddy 's melodic was singing his favorite songs these are things I remember of my precious mum and dad they taught me to be proud and be thankful for what I had now I am walking in their shoes and holding my head up high and every step I take I feel they 're glowing pride _"

    "text": "hi everybody my name 's Peter welcome to CJD TV I 'm from the city Greater Geraldton and this morning we 've got with us I 'm Chantal from wakaru chantal 's going to be doing a bit of a talk around how to survive over 19 and how do we cope with things on our own hi Chantal hi Peter yeah well thank you so I 'm from work row the lwase Center for rural health and I 'm the mental health academic they 're focusing on promoting mental health well-being in our community so of course at the moment we are all suffering I suppose from the covert 19 situation and I 've got some few tips here of how to manage that especially if you 're staying at home and your routine is quite different so first of all first of all checking in with others so when we 're when we 're at home when we 're working from home or just you know staying at home a lot we can become quite self isolated so it 's really important to check in with others so know just maintaining that that communication and we can do that through Skype we can do that through messenger Facebook however just picking up the phone and just calling somebody yeah really really important that we do maintain some sort of connection I think I can really relate to that with my family being in England at the time and we know and everything that 's going on over there yeah for me too for me to actually have that time with my family on a Sunday evening which is regular which is a routine which is something that I look forward to and really make something because all feel a lot better that 's right yeah and you so you mentioned routine routine is super important having a schedule having a some things to do during the day so that you can control what you can control in your home because we obviously we can 't control this and covert 19 but you you know feel reassured and comforted in what you can control in your own home in your own situation and having a routine having a purpose know um tasks during the day and that also helps with reducing their anxiety for children in your home because they also need routine they also need structure if they 're not at school just you know having not nothing to do all day is not it 's not a good solution so helping to structure at the time for the children also sure so so really I think that perhaps even though these times are uncertain and quite unpleasant are you saying that we can perhaps create some opportunities from from this yeah absolutely look at that I mean from the kind of the path of destruction that kovat 19 brings there are some positives so within yourself within your family or within the community so it 's looking for those and trying to stay away from those negative kind of dark thoughts and trying to balance that out with positive thoughts so spending more time with family even though sometimes that can be quite stressful but most of the time it 's nice to reconnect you know with family with friends over the phone quality time often we for a walk in the garden doing gardening chores together it can be it can be quite a nice activity and following on from that also mealtimes you know making that an actual activity of the day preparing meals together again that connection and it also teaches kids a new skill sure yeah so we 're also it gives us an opportunity to rewind perhaps and kind of reset and then introduce our family members into something other than perhaps the electronic kind of games yes that 's right yes that 's right I mean we need that technology at the moment to be able to communicate hater and four children also all teenagers especially they do still need to connect with their their peers that 's really important because they 're going through that development where they need that connection so even though we might try to limit the time on screens and we can still have boundaries for sure but encouraging them to keep connected with their peers it 's important during this time yeah so I think also before Chantal we were talking about maybe getting some something like that yes that 's right exercise is very important going outside getting some fresh air vitamin D just you know for our body and doing some gentle exercise or if you prefer going up running that 's fine too whatever exercise you want to do making sure you schedule that into your day so that the body feels you know happy so so rather than getting up in the morning aimlessly wandering around wondering what to do with the rest of the day to maybe have some sort of structure to do that 's right that 's right and actual activities because it 's easy to open up the computer or you know scroll on your phone and you know I 'm not saying that that 's not you know important you can do those things but trying to limit that because at the moment we see a lot of negativity especially in the news etc so that can actually impact us quite a lot and it can make us feel a little bit more negative little bit down worried increase anxiety anxieties so it 's it 's understand and with I guess the beautiful foreshore that we have got down there provided that we are keeping our distance and abiding by the social distance in laws that we 've got in place at the moment it 's a really great opportunity to get out and the weather at the moment is that yeah it definitely is yeah good idea to set be outside and enjoy what we what we what children is very proud to have absolutely yeah yep okay okay well thanks ever so much Chantel for community it 's a pleasant really really nice HUD vice there from Chantal and everybody just keeps they try to engage with each other look after each other abide by all the rules and thanks for watching _"

    "text": "hello I 'm Peter Forenza and welcome to Q QP TV and I 'm joined today for this Anzac Day special presentation by Warren Nathan Warren tell us a little bit about your involvement to this point with Anzac Day in Geraldton good morning Peter my involvement actually started with the RSL 15 years ago when I arrived in Geraldton as a young bloke or a younger bloke and over the course of those years I 've sort of had a bid as a committee member I 've been an active member of the RSL here in Geraldton I 've played a couple of roles on Anzac Day as a speaker here in there and this year I was privileged enough to be invited as the master of ceremonies with the current restrictions that 's not likely to happen this year in fact it 's not going to happen this year but it 's still very privileged to be involved throughout all of the things that happen in regard to not just Anzac Day but all the other commemorations longtan Day NAIDOC week those kinds of things that happen through it 's it 's a very important history and you being a New Zealand to know that as well too don 't you yes Anzac Day for me falls into an everyday category the importance doesn 't break down to everyday stuff but the way I see Anzac Day we commemorate it on the 25th of April every year but as a on a personal note I commemorate Anzac Day every day of the year i commemorate those who have gone before us not just in uniform and not just men not just women but everyone who has gone before us those who the mothers of soldiers them the fathers of soldiers there the wives of soldiers sailors and airmen or ear women as it is my mother-in-law Royal Air Force so I think of all the people who have compounded their lives together across time to create what we refer to today as our legacy Anzac Day embodies all of that for all of us but Anzac Day in my opinion isn 't about 1915 you 're an ex-serviceman though it must have be have have a certain significance the service I joined in the January of the year and come April of that year it was the first official time we had ever been mustered together as a group of men to attend Anzac Day commemoration services and I was 16 at the time and it didn 't mean so much as it does now because there were too many other outside influences going on move here get there stand straight stand tall and we were numbers on a parade square but as time wore on and we got to mingle with veterans from various return service associations in New Zealand we went to veterans homes when I say homes homes for veterans so there was a little place in Levin in the North Island of New Zealand and there were all veteran soldiers who had no homes of their own and they were built it in a room in a complex that was the Living War veterans home so we went to places like that and listened to the stories that these people had and in those days I 'm going back 40 years now there were were alive from both wars and very sparsely today do we see that number of stories being told at any RSL or RSA because time as we know wears people on and eventually they pass away and quite often their stories pass away with them but those stories as I heard as a young men they rang true and oftentimes I were I felt left out or jealous I don 't necessarily see the things the same way these days but the importance of what they did has grown on me how important other other stories you say now we don 't have the storytellers but how important is it to keep those stories very hard question to answer the stories themselves are echoed in modernity if we think about the the most recent veterans that we have they have their own stories that have a similar vein and the stories in themselves like a good novel I think have a way of engaging you to the romance of why we are gripped by the thought of the commemoration of Anzac Day in NZ day is the day that we don 't know is the right word but of all the thoughts that we have about heroes of all the thoughts that we have about courage of all the thoughts that we have about freedom of all the thoughts that we have about bad people of all the thoughts that we have about uniforms they all sit in a little group and the cherry that 's on top of that little group is Anzac Day and it all falls out of that so the stories about individual exploits they allow us the understanding of who people are and they 're no different today you 've got the recent Royal Harry who has created Invictus games we we then get to see in real life what we didn 't see two three four generations ago world war two World War one when all these soldiers came home with no legs and no hearing and blind and ears burnt off and all those sorts of things or now they 're back from modern times and they 're competing in their part of normal everyday life because we 've turned them into that normal life because they left their Shah part of normal life why can 't they come back that way and those are the stories that are important to all of us to the young ones I was thinking about the young ones earlier and they don 't have like you and I the ability to reminisce they don 't have a history yet whereas you and I as adult men have a history we can remember at reminisce on our times through life but our times are also involved in telling the young ones our stories Lauren I often think of Anzac Day and and even say other days that you 've mentioned there that commemorates a different different aspects of war throughout time as a as a time where I tend to feel humble I remember being in Melbourne one Anzac Day and it was after the the you know the the the great Anzac Day football clash between Essendon and Collingwood and we were in Richmond with some friends and we went to a pub that cricket his arms I think it 's called and we waited outside young veterans over that came along what made me so humble is that they were younger than me but had served for the country in either Iraq or Afghanistan or somewhere in the Middle East and you know had all them these medals on them and it was such a humbling experience for me and I think that that 's important too don 't you think for young people to have that humbling aspect and realizing how people have continued to do what 's right in our world in in the way of traveling overseas to to secure peace yeah I say year on its own but I actually think and please don 't be offended at all i I don 't necessarily think humble is the right word if I was to put a word on the same situation I would see the word the right word being proud you had and I 'll use your story you had the privilege to be able to stand there and look at these young veterans and put yourself into a position where perhaps there was a an ideology of being humble are no better than you they just chose a different path than you did and they were in my opinion amply rewarded for the path that they chose as a veteran that 's how I see it so when people are looking or in the confines or in the the arms reach of someone that they are almost enamored boy you can feel that humbling experience but I 'm saying that you shouldn 't you should be proud that you 're with within arm 's reach and you should be happy that they they are within arm 's reach because they came home safe I have a a very deep-seated thought process about corporal being Robert Smith VC and BA VC and I say to myself there is a guy who if I stood next to him he 's actually no better than I am but I 'm very proud to stand next to him there was a gallery that came to Geraldton a couple of years ago and it had all the vc winners and i have a picture in my phone one of 16 pictures that i have the the third photograph that 's in my phone is me standing next to the framed picture of being Robert Smith because I 'm proud to be standing next to that bloke I 'm not humbled by him but I 'm proud to stand next to him it 's like I 'm not humbled by my father but I 'm proud to stand next to him I know what my father is capable of and I 'm proud to stand next to him because he 's my dad so that 's how I see your story you know and and you 're proud to be standing next to those blokes and perhaps having a beer and side the cricketers arms when you finally get in the door I don 't know no I think you 've probably put the put the real feeling probably that I did have I suppose that leads us now to what sort of focus we should have on Anzac Day this year it 's it 's a different it 's a different base this year as we said at the beginning of this conversation you service or or a 11 o 'clock service here in Geraldton we 've with perhaps thousands of people I 've been to the recent dawn services and there 's thousands of people that they get up to go out into the streets of Geraldton in the early morning to commemorate an intact that 's not happening this year but the focus itself what what should people be be thinking and how should they be focusing do you think Warren people want to recognize what Anzac Day means to them and part of what we 're doing now is a recognition of what Anzac Day means to us and I 'll tell you a little story about my wife when my wife 's in the story and she 's a very good conscience for me but I got a phone call from the president of the RSL here in Geraldton Barry Stinson and he advised me that the meeting for the Coordination of Anzac Day had been canceled because Anzac Day had been canceled well the parade the other service had been cancelled and I immediately said over the phone to 'clock well as things have unfolded there 's a movement going around that people are going to stand at the end of their driveways and they 're going to pay their respects in that manner there 's a group of people who have declared that they 're going to blow their trumpets as it were and they 're going to play the last post and all of those things are absolutely great the conscience comes in my wife comes in when she reminds me that what we have taught our children always do what 's right even though no one is looking and to that end I live at the end of a road there 's no houses further on the road than mine and I 'll be in my driveway at 6 a.m. having my own piece of Anzac Day 2020 because her conscience is do what 's right even when no one is looking and it doesn 't matter where we are if I 'm at the end of my driveway and no one sees me I don 't care I see me I look at my face right thing so to me the focus for Anzac Day this year I can 't tell people what their focuses should be I know what my focus is going to be it 's going to be no different than it is every other day of the year to remember those who have fallen but on the 25th is the day that each of us has the opportunity to market without interruption there are two days that are very special to me the 11th of November at 11 o 'clock it 's very special to me and I mark that wherever I am and oftentimes we 'll see people stop on the streets at 11 o 'clock in the morning but Anzac Day is a day recognized to mark those who have gone those who have put their lives in their families on the line for yours and my [Music] privilege the privilege that we have but I see that happening around 65 days a year but the focus is the one day that we can all remember without question I don 't know if that answers your question but the a commemoration it 's it 's commemorated in France the Turks understand our need for Anzac Day commemorations Gallipoli is certainly closed this year so there are all these things that are happening in the past that aren 't happening in our not-too-distant future and we need to make sure that we 've had a part to play in all of that or and Nathan thanks very much for sharing your thoughts with us I 'm Peter Forenza and this has been qpt TV _"

second mr. mayor council Oliver oh thank you very much speak to a motion Council of all receive the right we should thank you thank you very much that 's the Culver yeah likewise mr. mayor thank you service to indicate intention to I just ask a question you certainly can question castle Douglas Douglas yeah I 'm just wondering if there 's an update since since that report and in terms of water and for for the year 1920 especially with staff coming back now as well which is great just wondering what the implications are where we are at the moment and how we 're trending if that 's okay third grade option a quick view of their position coming towards the end of April which as expected we 've had further decline in revenue so there 's been no real impact to employment services we budget for unemployment so that 's still tracking to budget but yes that is suggested in this monthly report we were starting the the full impact or the impacts coming into play with getting Webb needed points so that 's more evident and you 'll see that in the next month or so yes our position has gone deteriorated in regards to getting into a service position at the end of the year so we 're still predicting there will be in some form of you yeah speaker guys so anyone intending to fight against a sidearm speak now there are none I 'll declare that motion carried next item is item CCS 485 rates 20 20 21 notice of intention I wish to move from the chair a motion that for those have got the record that I 've been since around it 's the same as the executive recommendation with the exception that 3% discount rates paid in full one designated due date we lifted to 10% discount rates paid in full by the designated due date and it also adds in the additional points that will be no increase to the current rubbish collection charges in 2021 and note that the city will continue to apply the rates and interest charges as advised and set by the state government the emergency services may be yourself or carry two four and five as a 1 July 20 20 do have a second I got sorry cancer colony you were just in there first yeah happy two second thank you Thank You counselors so as we 've heard just recently from director of dodge couple of months there 's a significant revenue we 're sort of getting better at getting our heads around what that will look like what those numbers will be and certainly as we 've got a bunch of deliberations to continue on as a council and we still have another month or two of time before we have to consider if there 's a council the budget and what protections we will take will also continue to get more increased certainty over time however there being unknown for us as a council is a collectability of raise and particularly of concern for me is knowing that government stimulus payments like the job keeper payment expire in September which is only a month after the race notices are actually the first installment becomes due and need the remaining semester remaining almost all for Joe after that it 's a significant portion of our population that will be on job keeper probably anywhere up to a third of all workers in Geraldton we need to get the cash in yes it 's what I believe is this money that we won 't loss but it isn 't money that we 've yet budgeted for happens I have a long-term financial plan it will be a need for council to deliberate on budget workshops to work out how that could be funded or what services and what service levels we 'll have and what other provisions we might make for that that 's not the point of the motion examine today it 's just try and set out our main core strategy for getting in the cash because if you don 't collect the case once or well and good raising rates notices but if you don 't get the money you won 't have the cash so if we can stimulate in desire of people to pay upfront it 's going to I don 't feel that 3% is is enough of a carrot in this instance given that we are waiving all interests and installment charges for people that pay their pay their rates and noting of course that pinchers don 't even have to pay their rates they can actually defer them to their estate and they have a number to give you stimulate to see some of the cash actually coming in will be kin going forward this year we need to know how much we 've got so that we can quicker and more more efficiently either continue reopen facilities bring start back all those sorts of things because without certainty and this is going to be absolutely flat on the flip side of this it does give people genuine right relief so no discount for incentive system that you put in place next year we 'll do anything to incentivize anybody as always the case revaluation as we go up and down all over the show so you 're really going to get one crack at this and that 's why I think we should go hard this year and the reason that this camp really payment is it so it doesn 't embed itself in the long term financial plan in the operating claims at least anyway the motion is to only apply this as I should have noted earlier only in 2021 2021 to try and stimulate and work out the effects of what they councillors lost rates will be struck for that year does allow us to track exactly where we 're going and how work out we do in future rate and budget deliberations next year will be a revaluation here-and-now amount of incentives will work in working that environment Kessler thank you ma 'am this item actually gives us a really great opportunity to demonstrate some community and leadership in response to Kovac 19 I am in support of the 10 percent rates discount as an incentive for early payment of rates I can see the benefit of this particularly to commercial commercial property ratepayers and probably our farming community out there as well you know those people have multiple property and more to pool and home holdings early payment will assist for cash flow the current turbid 19 crisis has us facing many challenges it is also seeing all levels of government looking for ways to adapt and innovate in response to these challenges its creates an opportunity for us at the local government level to innovate in ways we would never have considered before I consider the rates just kind doing things we also have we also only have for 2021 budget year to pilot an innovate budget changes as the mayor has said you know we have there are evaluations the following year which actually will stifle any innovation that we might you know have thought about and likely that 's an opportunity to do that so I think that it is really important that we we have a really that we look at this as a way to do something different to support our community it will also give us some really good data to have a look at in following years about how this may or may not have worked we won 't know if we don 't actually give it a go so I am would ask my fellow councils to actually think about this it 's a really great opportunity to share our community community leadership and to do something a little bit different to support our ratepayers thank you thank you can sekolah well as it caming you have a question that 's ok me and you what percentage pay up upfront normally anyway so that that equates to better the 25 or 50 percent thank you Thanks so they are call for a speaker a speaker again sir mr. Macon on open amendment once the Douglas mr. Mira I 'd like to move an amendment just to change 10% to 5% the rest of it absolutely as is so I think that 's just an amendment not a change of motion yes I agree I agree with that counselor I 'll accept that as an amendment can I move that amendment please yes you 've moved the amendment reduces to 5 do I have a second down mr. mayor council I have a question but I will second the 5% trying it me order right yet so you 're going to second the reduction to 5 yep Tandy yes mr. Mann we 'll have a question later we 'll have an amendment will come to that I 'm sure Thank You mr. Mann Thank You councillor Santee at least I can put the arguments forward and we can perhaps go from there I 've got a couple of points that are perhaps a similar but here we go the I think the tempest of all I think the 10% is overly generous and I think it potentially could put us into a little bit more financial difficulty down the track but I 'll make that case in just a minute the 5% I think is is reasonable the average rate payer pays around about 2,300 5% will save the average rate payer over 100 115 dollars and I think anything with a triple figure in front of it I think will will certainly catch people 's attention I think we also got to consider that the 5% comes on top of the 1.5 percent that would have been levied this year or imposes here which we are not so even the 10% was really effectively at 11.5% the 5% is effectively 6.5 percent and the 6.5 percent basically saves the average rate by over 150 dollars that 's not inconsiderable I think we 've got remember the 1.5% that 's already been foregone the other thing I 'd like to mention is that the 5% will see the city forgo 1.1 million dollars rate payers pay on time the 10 percent will see the city for go to point 2 minute double that of course now you might say well there 's only another 1.1 million but let 's look at a couple things as my it 's my understanding that the city parently has has loans telling over 30 for around 35 million dollars our annual interest bill if I am correct he 's ran about 4.5 million dollars our revenue this year is going to decline somewhere around 15 million dollars yes that 's based on a worst case scenario but it 's going to be probably I would have thought at least said no right it 's maybe maybe towards 15 if it gets really really bad so we 've got big lines on the books interest to pay our revenues Wade way down and I think we also have to consider the impact of a big discount now on future budgets and what happens next year yes we have prevails but we 're going to add 10 percent for a start to a lot of people and maybe the play out so I think next year people will get a bit of a could end up with a bit of a shock rather than a perhaps a pleasant surprise so with that with the fee waiver sorry the other the cost for the other fee waivers is around about 3 million dollars the 5% that I 'm proposing is another 1.1 that takes it to about 4.1 or so and don 't forget the extra there 1.5 percent that we are not imposing which is for God as well that 's about another 750,000 so 5% the fee waivers the 1.5 percent that 's forgone we 're talking about something around about four point eight million dollars of release of Direct Relief that the city is given to all its ratepayers and I just want to reiterate that we still have loans on our books of 35 million dollars and our interest rates for point the rape sorry the relief right across the board between rates and the fee waivers as mentioned by counsel a collar vote before goes right across the board and I think it should be mention key messages I think we can sell 5% if the messages from both Emir in the sea are very strong and on this basis that is we 're not doing the 1.5 we 're back to zero but not only that we 're giving you a five percent discount not only that we 're giving you fee waivers that are amounting to over three million dollars and on top of all that we want those that can pay those that can pay please do pay because that allowed the city to get on with its business to provide the services and keep it start providing those services my last point is if push comes to shove and as per the papers the city can go to Treasury and get hopefully low in the current environment allowing for us lion that 'll get us through the cash process so I 'm actually urging everyone to support a five percent increase for the reasons I 've just outlined thank you thank you council Taney Thank You mr. mayor I 'm happy to go with the the 5% but I 'm not if I could has the government blocked in that there won 't be any penalty interest or installment charges or payment plan charges is is that is that certain no they have not as of yet so council to any of you need yourself again sorry beg your pardon mr. mee no I won 't support the motion in that case mr. mayor I think you 're sickening the amendment I 'm sickening the five percent but not point four if that makes sense I may have thrown things out there just a little okay so you 're supporting amendment to fire for the purpose of okay yes okay okay you want to speak to you I 'm into the amendment to my amendment or and to Steve 's amendment okay yep support the 5% I think that 's that 's a good number I think 10% is too generous I think we need to remember that I think the worst of them of the virus has passed and we need to be careful not to make too many cats in in revenue because I I do believe the worst a recovery around Australia that will follow it will be a nice strong recovery with regard to the fee waivers I 'm totally opposed to that mr. Muir haven 't got more to say about that until we get to my amendment thank you okay a speaker for are speaking against the amendment Oh Thomas yep you used to speak against yes please thank you we are all in really uncertain times at the moment and i really afford the mayor including his motion forward for 10% this is just to consider it 's nothing more it is it is a starting point of considering if we go with councilors Doug councilor Douglass 's amendment of five it 's very hard to go up but to come down from 10% is a lot easier so I am talking against Council of Douglas amendment and because of the uncertainty times and it 's only just a considerate he 's bigger for this timaya Council Accord well I 'll speak for speaking for the reduction to five can support law I 'm sorry we 're still on the amendment I withdraw that I just like to applaud what counsel the Douglas said but in the rates that go round the average person pays about 2,900 with rates which rubbish and Midwest Midwest disaster or fire brigade those rates don 't come into the equation so on a saving of 5% is only 120 dollars to the ordinary person on rates I 'm against any rate deductions as there will be an amendment brought up later on with a bit of a waiver thank you thank you squeak against its mega fall mr. mayor council call Bell to speak against councillor Douglas his amendment so one thing I 'm calling for another speaker for okay there 's no speaker for speaker against cancer court well thanks mr. Muir and my view on this is that the men 's motion has set the discount right if it 's to be material discount and a considerable discount at 10% I don 't believe 5% will get the job done I don 't think that it 's sufficient and so I wouldn 't support councilor Douglass 's amendment thank you thank you speaker 4 yeah councillor it 's um it 's a good start I do think 10% he 's a tad generous and uncertain economic times and I think 5% is a good character people so for that reason I like council publicist amendment thank you question mr. Muir cancer forensics forensics goes to support um we just talked a moment ago I think you said Paul about the amount of Rights that that do come in on time v Percy I know it 's probably hard to judge but cash flow wise how much how much does that sort of bolster bolster the the sort of bum I don 't know money we have at hand situation counselor so based on that out over the last couple of years past history or show that get around about twenty million at the due date so five percent if you ask me what would be the opportunity of money lost for five percent then that would be around about artisan needs 1 million isn 't it all this is one weird that is if we get the profile of cashing twenty me just need to know the to the bottom line of operating costs and yeah that sort of just makes a little bit clearer for me thank you speaker against it sorry little fist just ask a question please yeah speaking against I 'm sort of being agree with what councillor Thomas said that at the moment this is an intention only and we can come down I 'm think aiming at people who have a lower income five percent the people who pay their account rates account upfront will do that problem regardless and so they 'll do that with five percent the ten percent will those appeal to those sitting on the fence who may have the cash there but in the current situation want to sit on it and I think a ten percent is the biggest incentive that the my man for those who are going to sit on the fence and hold back but ten percent will push them over to pay and pay it up front sorry I 'm just speaking against that five to ten speaker full-speed yes I 'll speak against just briefly I just didn 't the worst has passed we haven 't even seen the start or the economic damage this will do particular as a city and we 've collected 95% of our racist financial year already so we haven 't even seen the impacts other than realistically by the airport knocks the office getting show revenue at qpt and a Kareena and the like we 're nowhere near at the start of this job keeper and all those things were nowhere near the start I can use a personal example as a corporate as a corporate landlord you know we have a gym that can 't trade through out there on zero income mutations massage parlors zero income dining restaurants the adults are doing some takeaway pubs zero income this is not a minor reduction of these entities and all again we are using best guesses at the moments to win these are things might come back and we do get some more time this is an intention to consider is to set some framework around what this might look like and you know if council attendees optimistic view of the world it going to Bali by August occurs and then the bike in June we can make adjustment for that during the budget deliberations which we have to do as council vote when I when I 'm talking to all those businesses that are shut they are on zero and indeed a lot of these businesses will now be funding government handouts a month in arrears and the job Keifer payment for those that are eligible is paying in arrears there 'll be businesses payroll might be ten thousand a week is now going to go to twenty thousand a week because they 're all casuals are like they might have been with them for 12 months or part-time and they go put fund them at bridging finance with bridging loans with overdrafts and I 'm talking now as an accountant we have not at all seen what this is going to look like until well I 'm not saying you 're gonna know until June but I 'd rather have the option out there at June or is an idea so we can set some framing and the executive can go feed into our budget deliberations going forward that 's what those impacts are and if counselors present a better argument at the time for five or ten or whatever that number of my baton then we 've got plenty of opportunity to take that in but we need a signal that these are not normal times these are not going to be this as usual any time and certainly the worst hasn 't passed what we 're trying to do is ensure that we survived the worst in my view thank you do I have a right require mr. Muir and what their yeah I do you like them city well speaker for speaker of gangs okay so Douglas you 're gonna reply thanks mister man yeah just a couple of comments that I 'm in respect to the comments made by councillor Thomas and elphic and yourself mr. Muir I think if this motion is passed it so if the motion original motion is passed at 10 percent there was a comment that that was made by a few other councillors that weekend yourself mr. Muir that we could a snowflakes chance in hell of once the 10% go through as a motion that you were then going to go out to the community and say oh by the way it 's only 5% or 6% absolutely no way what you could do is go 5 percent and we 've considerably in fact we 're going to go 10 percent that would be very well received if that 's what 's needed there is no way you can go from 10 percent if that 's supported down to 5 I 'm sorry that argument does not stack up in any logical sense whatsoever my other concern of course is services we 're going to if it is 10 percent there 's going to have to be as we will be anyway real close look at the services we offer that 's not necessarily a bad thing and perhaps it 's a good opportunity to do so but that will happen whether it 's 5 percent or 10 percent I 'm very wary the ten percent is just going to put another million dollar and millstone around our futures thank Hall I say no looting debate I missed that one no we 've concluded debate okay no that was all right I 'll bring it up in the next part to mr. downs and then I expect cancers we 're now putting aside into the vote the amendments order they to me so I 'm just telling the vote cancel that motion is the amendment is defeated seven six all aboard accounts are closed well I 'd see counselor ten he 's voted twice in that amendment has come up on the screen I don 't know if that 's correct or not once yes of once no so could that be clarified please no I haven 't got I haven 't_''_2876.319 got that yeah yes as well be the one that 's taken counsel tanti that 's good as he is yeah so that motion is still defeated seven seats short anyone you bet what we reform so that the original motion becomes a substantive motion now let 's quotient we it other than the mover and a seconder do I have the spigot against you canceled my cancer motion sort of thing for shadow motion I just like to move that the council do not increase residential rates in 2020 and 21 financial budget as an incentive to promote early payments of rates in full within 30 days of being issued a proposed that 30 of the rate payers who do so to be randomly selected to win 1,000 cash through the council way of saying this is we were talking 10% which is a loss of between 1.9 and 2.2 million now that 's we get 20 million in of rates of those rates we lose 600 per rate payer these rates the 10% discount will not be on the land well we 're not on the rubbish reflection or the emergency services so if your rates are gonna be for your 10% discount on 3,000 there 's only gonna be two hundred and forty dollars so cancel Parker just hold for six I 've got that you forced out of that motion now I 'm moving to speak against yeah yeah what we 've what we 've seen over the past five or six years and Coburn 19 it 's completely different but most of the people that have paid these 20 million in the first month are our elderly people that pay everything in full I am for one that pay off my rates and that and paid the penalty which is the interest and everything only because I did do not have the money at the time for my portfolio these people the incentive is great but I we 'll see in the year to come the hardship that people are going to have and I 'll take me hard off me hat off to the present Muir and CEO for the direction that they forecast to two months ago with this Cogan we were the first on the ground floor to look at cost cost savings and everything like that and we were the forefront for most councils now every council is going to be doing it hard to lose between 1.9 and 2.2 million in revenue there 's going to be very hard to catch up what councillor Douglas spoke earlier on we 're giving him three million dollars worth of assets 's why I 've come up with a 30 day there 30 people is that we voted two months ago for the battery-operated car through the RAC the bus that was going to be a donation of 30,000 towards that and seen that didn 't know venture wait I thought well it 's a good idea to give me incentive for people to pay their rates upfront but no discount thank you very much any cancer Parker speaker for speaker against suasion mr. mayor council Corbeau I 'll speak for and you can support one thanks mr. mee councillors I guess most of us at some point since 2013 or indeed later if we were recently elected have probably committed to a reduction in rates and we 've certainly been able to bring the rate of increases down over the last five and a half years and the city to be congratulated for being able to find ways to do that that 's taken a lot of pressure off however lowering the trending increases is not really the same at all as reducing rates and that 's something that I I would really like to see and as Sanders says cabin virus and its impact is there is really a chance for governments everywhere to reset things and start again and think differently and I see the emotion before us is trying to achieve two things and they 've already been mentioned but to encourage early payment of race so that the range of level of services can be cleaned and reliably delivered next year the more revenue we can attract in and the earlier we can attract it the more solid our planning 's for this service delivery will be for 2021 and therefore the better the community 's ability to rely on what we say we 're going to deliver so the discounts will be important I think in in attracting early payments but the other reason is to reduce the actual cost of rates to the community to acknowledge the massive impact financial impact the economic impact of this virus and I think if we 're going to discount lates an acknowledgement of the financial impact and the Mays alluded to some of that already it needs real difference to people 's cash flows through the year and I also note that whatever discount we arrive at if indeed we do arrive the discount some or all of that could potentially be offset if we reconfigure the way we deliver services but that 's an issue for a later debate to achieve both those the outcomes to encourage early payment of rates and to provide financial relief to the community I 'm convinced that nothing that less than 10% reduction will get that job done so I 'm asking for counselors to help the community and support the 10% reduction as proposed thanks mr. Muir Thank You speaker against yes I 'd like to speak to my makeup before I ask my speak I just asked mr. O 'Doul some respects to a right buyer base how many years we had success in large percentage looking at the previous item on the agenda we 're 95 7 that people paid their rates in a year if we had a very good record of people paying their rates over years past they 're good of the lightest among mean we can close to a hundred percent every year in saying that that hundred percent doesn 't represent just the current year right it represents a rewrite as well so we normally get close to 99 percent and you would say in the low 90 percent would be a count year rate and the other percentage would be a really erase from produced years so it gives me a question yes we have a very good collection rate we always have thank you very much now leaning into my comment for the 10% as the council of long standing here and seeing us as players have gone through a fair amount of turbidity over the years and respects to our rates and rate issues and the fact that matter is while Steve raised some very good points in respects to a dropping to the 5% I think we 've got to our people over the feeling and compassion in respects to the grief we 've dealt out over the past couple of years mindful of the fact that the money that we may well lose could in some states in a diverse fashion and I think we basically work to those people in our community to give them some sort of incentive ation looking at the 95 percent on that last report reading and hence my question is I think we have a very reliable community who will meet that I for one am one of those people that pays on the right straight up because I 'm position I can do it but the fact is I expect that because the city gives service delivery and I think a lot of people buy by paying their rates understand that we give that good service delivery and this will show us in good stead in not being the mediocres rate increases going back to the so-called 7.6 year or whatever the case like that it 's showing an element of compassion over this year because who knows how long this is going to go for but I think we can over to our on the humanities side just to do this whilst it was realloc when it Steve putting the dollars and cents to it for the sake of collectively adjust those books with service delivery and other things you know perhaps the wavering of fees it 's not appeal that many people want to take but I 'm more so concerned to the people out there that this is a one-off situation to give them a good showing and show that when you have compassion and understanding and we need that money in as quickly as possible to keep our community rolling along and I think it 's very very important and willingly I accept that a 10% it 's the only way to go thank you your worship okay me what exactly was councillor Parker 's amendment before are we talking about that no shadow demotion caster caming okay thank you so if this motion fails his motion is essentially largely the same but with no disappear and and 35 worth of prizes for incentives so that was about the only addition the be incentive and no discount okay thanks speaker against councillor Douglas yes mister me I 'm not going to go through my arguments for the five percent against the ten I 've done that 'd have to say and very convincing and I agree with those sentiments as with yours mr. Muir as well however I do believe that 10% is just taking a little bit too far and I do believe it 's going to cause us more paying potentially down the track so I I just wanted to have it on the record that the intent on Toby I totally support and I told you support a discount I totally support the waiver and everything else in in the item I just don 't agree with the figure and it 's only that that I 'm going to be voting against I just want that to be very clearly understood because I think the intent we all I think are very well intentioned as to the intent it 's just a number that I 'm going to be voting against thank you thank you it 's bigger for a right of reply just quickly councils another aspect people touched on this corporate people and old people that pay their rates we 've heard that well a lot of corporate landlords actually don tenants that 's actually the common unless you are a whole both your land and your trading in tea in the same entity the decision your corporates going to have to make is are they going to go to pass on those on go on those outgoings and obviously the state government and the federal government federal government particular has already said their comment if you can demonstrate your now who 's being affected by coronavirus some of the code of conduct those they 'll have to capitalize you will eventually be out of recoup yeah outgoings but they won 't matter for it but they all have to do I 'm not that on pass it 's gonna this can save people struggle so the landlord themselves will have the option of either paying up front and making the Tennessee and then passing it back down because wait until the time comes that they can either terminate their tenant or arrears or not so it 's a bit of a concern in that next place for the pensioner or anyone to be a pensioner well I don 't have just no reason in my right mind but just make no sense and the risk that presents to us is is if the formalin collections is coronavirus related or the removal of the interest installment related we just won 't know so it 's a bit of an unknown a guessing game and we get to take some that certainty out of it when you heard from director rodiles one in ten people are paid value anything right the city Murray is already that 's now one in ten I don 't know the numbers going to be going forward but I 'll suggest one in ten significant the higher as unemployment skyrocketed who knows where 2030 was in there are people I got feeling stupid today so here 's a budget coming up I appreciate everyone 's putting on the same sort of pager or looking for ways to stimulate all looking for ways to get money in you know I don 't_''_3754.41 that wasn 't the intent intentions to get for you where we 're at it also means we get the community you know some 10% is and let 's see what the community appetite for that is like you know whether that can be done by some surveys and polling whatever mean it was going to go right sniffles good one all their services typical for how the community relates but we can actually have a conversation about that with a bit of background so cancers I ask you to support my motion seeing now if counts Larroquette are we voting for the foreshadowed one or for your motion availing for my motion motion Thank You mr. me of having trouble voting than I am councillor forensic here budding yeast Thank You tricky it 's start the same boat just trying to get this sir handsome old feed yes sir three that items carried ten three against was a clone Parker and Douglas item 12.3 reports of destructive services near our new item 12.4 reports of the office of the CEO I 'm CEO zero six four council policy see three four one five affixation of the common seal mr. mayor council Oliver Council a whole city councillor Culliver we should speak to your motion Oh on what we do and it 's entitled we should add Dorset with the comments yes likewise it 's you know he 's actually a governance issue and it 's in compliance weaned from its nine point four nine a of the LG Act thank you thank you does anyone wish to speak against this item being none in opposition I 'll declare that motion carried items CEO zero six five coded at nineteen for decisions and proposed future actions Council distant news from the floor the executive recommendation is presented plus the additional four points was that we commence opening a public toilets in high-traffic areas and monitor them for vandalism and theft of supplies in compliance with state health directives that we start returning the C 's barbecues to service they 've reopened our pool camping ground and note that state government has directed that playgrounds to remain closed have a second Thank You counsel as you are aware between the agenda going out and this meeting tonight you have limitations on outdoor gatherings have been lifted from two to ten people but not with all nine unrelated some people from the house and all those sorts of things so there will be lifted camping restrictions have been wiped out boating recreational all fully endorsed now and alike we all surrounding shires have all reopened up reopening their public toilets in Northampton and Chapman Valley they 've certainly reopened up their camping areas and their toilets you know when it comes to things like toilets we also see notice that we 're having we 're on certain fielding fielding significant complaints about people having to urinate and defecate in bushes and parkland and the like fascinating wise we get in what significant complaints from RV campers they are going and moving and parking and CF camp we 're told us might be open or we 're near some are more secluded spots which of course is why we invented the RV spots and them in the first place so we need to look at a staged opening up it is it is written intentionally for the CEO typical hydro Gary 's it 's all you work them out because where 's Big Bang or not but we 'll to so that we can ease up a bit in keeping with the state government 's directives that 's why of course we just know the playgrounds are closed we make the points we always do that today still no federal estates indeed early early talked so that they 're probably going to be punishing us more than I 'll be assisting us if we don 't take steps going forward to civil day little bit and as for all those other RFPs well that 's been a stake of initiatives what else roll them over and that 's agency compliance costs could we just get on with continued the work actually has to get crackin in the work in the recovery and not get held up by delays and tendering and all the like so for the time comes to flick the switch on our project we 're all good to go so probably might lighten up if you cancel it Jesus if we 've got a few less tenders going through for that period anyway thank you Casa Colorada Thank You mr. mayor I will reserve the right 30 questions councils 30 speakers against no speakers against most speakers sickening I 'll declare that motion carried unanimously five twelve point five reports diversity our one four reports to be received April I 'll move both Thank You council whole thing is thank you mr. mayor council all of our significance akalabeth thank you used to speak your motion it 's purely a to process we go through that 's all your worship thank you very much councillor Colliver no thank you to me so yeah we just big to speak against or to this item those speakers I 'll declare that motion carried I 'm 13 enough motions by members of each previous notice has been given on an M 1 3 notice of motion for Ellis Islands Tourism Council TMT I envision you have a motion oh yes sir mr. mayor I support my motion thank you I 'm happy to second counselor Douglas Douglas thank you council teeny yet before Thank You mr. mayor mr. mayor councillors I 'm sure you want to read my comments and why I 've put this motion up but it opening of the abrazo silence the mainstream and managed tourism to summarize what when I 'm at the cupboard 19 pandemic is ending but I do take on board the the mayor 's comments that the recovery will take a probably a whole lot longer that it might be we might be in for a long position but we do need to think ahead and try and position ourselves to take advantage of the recovery when it comes secondly tourism is labor-intensive it creates jobs in investment and let 's not forget tourism is about three percent of our economic activity so clearly there 's a lot of room for growth thirdly I know that tourism waa he 's talking about making wild flowers our promotional handle which is great but there are other places that can also use wild flowers as a tourist attraction Hyden the golf fields central we build esperance the gas going Murchison wildflowers are not unique to the Midwest and neither are history that we 've got some great history great features and great weather other places have those advantages or some of them what the abroad us islands fourthly there is a market for tourism on the abala silence that 's just waiting to be tapped it 's not just international and interstate but just down the road there are 2 million people in Perth and we need to note that in peak season when roads to places in the southwest such as busselton and Margaret River are clogged with traffic it 's actually quicker and far safer to get the Geraldton we just have to give people a reason to come here and finally councilors mr. mayor I 'd like to draw your attention to a comment by the Minister for tourism Labor templeman which was stop being Petty and asking for assistance step up and bring forward works and capital programs no that 's fine and that 's why I think we need to let the state government know that fast-tracking mainstream and managed tourism on the abolish islands complete with accommodation and associated facilities is our best way of doing just that it 's just a matter of the state government basically letting it happen Thank You mr. mee Thank You that councillor taint he introduced a similar motion earlier this year that was calling on the city to to take carriage on the investment process if you like for the city to canvass potential investors take that information back to the city etc etc at the time I moved a separate motion suggesting that should go to the obamas Islands interagency team which was all very very good we all knew that was going to take a bit of time but I think we 're at a slightly different situation now and I think as councilor tanti I think correctly is pointing out time has gone on we are in a fairly difficult situation not just us but the whole state and as well as the interagency team doing its bit doing whatever it 's doing it 's going to take a while because government does I think we have the chance as a local council now to perhaps put the foot down a little bit more firmly in a positive way in response not just to the virus but in to the whole economic situation the whole state and I previously may have it 's a little bit of caution and go through the top of protocols and process I think we 're living in different times and I commend councillor tanta for coming back again and again and again but coming back again this time with with with an urgent motion to get this moving along and I for one and right behind him on this one thank you thank you speaker again yes mr. mayor council all of them has the color hey Thank You mr. mayor um I would just like to point to point out and wants to do other things that previously council has supported tourism at the Ebola through the growth plan through our beloved Island tourism policy we also had it on a list for the to harm 2017 state government election priorities the animation that came to council on the 18th of December 2018 we had another motion again on the 26th of November 2019 and we also need to note that the CEO is a member of the interagency project team okay so I think it 's just important that thrown towards tourism at the brothers in terms of councillor chanteys motion to us that 's on the table today point number one the way that that reads I think that is some subjective last time I looked it wasn 't illegal to visit the islands so I think some of the points he 's made there is a active doesn 't sit very well with me notes three point three note that restricting chores and visitation to the islands today trips um I haven 't actually heard that so I 'm not sure if that is subjective as well and in terms of point anything in Co point three you know I think we need to acknowledge that let me sit outside of our jurisdiction at the islands that is the role of government is to develop the framework and the public infrastructure needs for tourism at liberal as I 've said this many times and I still have that point of view also point four so direct co2 commitment from the state government to accelerate the process yes we already know that there is money allocated and budget we also know that stage two that the Midwest Development Commission are running the forty million dollar second stage here bolus is well advanced and I 'm pretty confident that they would make it through to any stimulus project program that the state government might be considering for recovery point five that actually rates to me like you 've suggested that the CEO get himself an invitation to attend a cabinet meeting I actually think that burdensome and then just use of the CEOs resources to be pursuing such an outcome so I will not be supporting this Thank You speaker again I 'll actually speak against this one too surprisingly the for much the same reason accounts the cholera said we already have a significant amount of affirmation of support the odds and I don 't want to be can I have sitting no intention of reducing that level of support but to state that day trips are suboptimal we have a 280 C fast ferry coming around the coast as we speak it 's actually currently the horizontal Falls in the Kimberley and we 're looking for a the developers is looking for money to do with with places to dock fast ferry journeys and all the services on day trips are an absolutely essential part of opening up the air bravas Islands and as councillor collip said is currently not illegal and witnesses that fishing and other activities are currently unregulated not monitored that 's simply not true if you in fact it 's actually bureaucrat you want to go and fish at the Apollo silence you actually have to register online with the Department of Fisheries and noting your license number and you have all the bag limits and there are fisheries if they don 't meet you at the jetty they meet you on the boat or they 're out while they 're out there that 's not actually uncommon and to be challenged by them while we 're out there I do know I secured contributions that were made but I don 't think this motion is going further in look trying to come in the video conferences with all those people we 've bled out getting David Seaman to actually been asked to 't imagine he 's going to at all tolerate us trying to get a hold of him that Lane the minister is the Alana materials also tied up with the developer mission the stage two and let 's face it the state budgets not being launched until October this year anyway they put back their budget quite some quite quite away so I just think it 's a bit of over overreached some of the language that there 's used notwithstanding that I do fully support response tourism as is long-established cancer policy you have a council policy for that I think some of some of the language in here is a bit too robust speaker for me I suppose speaker against cancer Tandy you 'll write a reply thanks mr. mee well again councillors the thrust of my motion is to simply ask the state government can you fast-track tourism on the islands it will ultimately happen in what form we don 't know yet the interagency project team that 's fantastic they 're going to be releasing a draft management report in June 2021 that 's a draft and the morning put from other people so who knows when the final report will be released it is council policy Thank You mr. mayor for mentioning that and but in fact we can go back to 1992 when a state government report recommended tourism on the islands and 1992 what 's that twenty eight years ago a long time for not much to happen these are as councillor Douglas said different times that we live in a lot of things have changed the the pandemic has obviously had a big impact on our economy the recession that almost certainly will happen it might be a bad one is another thing that 's very different that we didn 't have to worry about just a few months ago we need to find ways to increase revenue I understand it 's not illegal to visit the islands however it 's not cost-effective it 's cheaper to go and go to Shark Bay and spend two or three days at Denham it 's not a problem to do that it 's probably cheaper to go to Bali in some ways it 's of dollars and that 's the visit I like a half-day trip to visit one beach on one Island and that 's that 's not going to attract a whole lot of tourists there are boat charters which are great but they tend to take days and not everybody 's into a boat chatter the the role of one of the roles of our council is Tibet the Geraldton and and again mr. Mira counselors all I 'm saying is let 's ask the state government can you guys consider accelerating expediting the process to allow tourism with accommodation and facilities on the islands let 's ask the question that 's all I have to say Thank You mr. mayor Thank You council taenia that motion is lost eight-five because i 'm for any questions from members of which to notice has been given there are none I don 't clear new business of its movement actually introduced by decision on the meeting there is none clean media close the public there is no confidential iron so I don 't now this meeting at 23 p.m. on Tuesday the 20th a varied smooth a meeting thank you _"

Johnson more questions on that item who now moves of DCs four four nine less which mr. me cancel parka with these new laces being thrown around sort of thing and ones to be renewed I was informed the other day that the town being still haven 't got their lease on their building and just clarify that and there 's another one that 's been brought to my attention the Racing Pigeon Club when I renew their lease and the price that that been quoted through the counselor I think it 's mrs. McLeod she 's the one that 's giving them the and it 's a tin shed over near the old rubbish rubbish tip site sort of things so there 's been vandalised the last couple of week with graffiti and the ten members are sort of tossed up whether or not for the renewal of the lease last year I think they paid four hundred and sixty bucks in rates because there 's no rubbish collection or anything it 's only used twenty six times a year but that 's another one that 's coming up for renewal just wonder Kimmel taken it on notice you can write it to the RDCs for four rights or in your lease and you lace brain rescue Geraldton yeah but we 've got all these leases coming up but this is the forest boots the Geraldton marine rescue we will tell you about thank you notes mr. man Council of tanki and Sultana yeah just a query and it 's not a big issue for me but why is there an a to align the lease extension with the residential places at at point more given that they have very different purposes would or is it just easier if they 're aligned it 's actually a lot easier if we align them because what you made Cole he actually work out the difference in between and this way how many members in corporate services out of CCS for one council policy 4.2 night attendance at events the questions that can I counselor Forenza here mr. Muir can I ask the question please yeah I 'm just on that and just reading through it has it been some questioning about whether this should go ahead has there been a lot of the public asking about events frequented by say counselors or of Directors officers here at the city what 's called this about the state government passed legislation requiring councils to adopt an attendance at events policy as a result of the reviewing to the CEO Perth it 's not to your requirement that you have such a policy okay you know thank you thank you the questions the Nami we moved to bottom ccs for a to council policy 4.17 Public Interest Disclosure Christians there are no item CCS 483 gram user fees grand face about including the ones through the cheer and thanks for the question so the 2020 plan the winter ones arrive in 2021 so that 's taken into consideration and the next well a couple of items from here so the point being the summer sports a livid in the coming week or two just for the timing of existing arrangements the winter sports will only be the term as part of council budget deliberations going forward is to avoid a notice going out in councilor Teddy Sultana thanks mr. Muir I 'm just curious why this is on the agenda most summer sports did manage to finish off their season successfully cricket didn 't quite kids at the grand finals but water polo certainly finished softball did basketball did you know those those associations involved in those sports and other sports they basically there 'll be a commitments for the year so they you know they would have made whatever money they made off their members I 'm not sure why we 're looking to waive these feasts and the saying goes with the fees which I presume their seasons as well mr. CEO so thanks for the question counselor tan T the reason why this has come up before you is that the finance team are just about to send out this round of invoices to the summer sports boat for this financial year so the winter sports have already been built and paid for this financial year so what we we didn 't want we didn 't want to go and send out a new set of bills to these sporty users during the covert lockdown without you guys working out whether you want to or not we were just picturing people being upset that they 're being billed because and the grounds are closed or they can 't do their sport I get your point that most of those sports did finish but in the in the media it 's very hard to explain that bit versus the current bit if that makes sense so if I 'll get past the supplementary mr. man it 's not a knee so the weather sports would be getting a rebate if this passes no they haven 't been billed and paid okay first the bills go out hey just with that reading from football West they send us email the other day and through the council about working with them and that so that the Football Association are here in Georgia take it up sorry councillors if I could just ask just the irreverence cues please announce their name first to give you a chance to director where was through the middle of an answer this is actually quite a hard thing to deal with with people interjecting mr. CEO sorry thanks counselor so look that the thing to try and get get a rate your head around is that those two we 're talking about two financial years so it 's just talking at the moment about the current financial year which is just about to end so the winter sport for this financial year was billed back in last year so they received their bill about six months ago and they 've been dealt with we were just about to send out the summer bill for this current finest financial year and that 's the to the winter sports coming up and the letter from the Football Association you 'll be dealing with you 'll be dealing with that in a later paper with respect to the intention to rate so in the next paper in a couple papers time you 'll see we 're also suggesting that you waive all the Sporting Club fees for the next financial year cancel the Cordwell question mr. mee the recommendation is for the 2019 20 summer sporting ground user fees that 's last year current year we 're sorry April 2020 as we speak of course it is Thank You mr. mayor council council of tatty hesitating yeah to be honest I found the recommendation that bit confusing as well because it does say summer and then it 's talking about the whole year so I don 't be council corbels alone in being a little bit confused but as the CEO said this will be coming up in a couple of items so I guess we can talk about it more then thank you Italian you stood on line Tahlia along I 'm gonna take it crece prison Douglas yes yes TV yeah can sleep over yeah I 'm here thank you very much on the rest of you I can stay in video the further questions easiest or a three-way of 2019-20 sporty grannies of things yes sir I didn 't see at least in the attachments or anything on this article of our family sports are involved in this and I think as councils we should be quite aware of how many different sporting organizations it does does hit it up at this being told all this he 'll provide after the upcoming me just texted me and said she can hear you get here okay your poor internet no further questions on that item counselors there are nanny will move to autumn CeCe 's or a false statement financially the 31 March 2022 ask any signs of a reflection on the impact of these I can see the capital expenditure but anything else infected in those market dirty riddles thankfully the question counselor claimed and we 've added some new crafting to the monthly financial report through some indication of the impacts physical we had bought passenger numbers which is a good indication of the decline in revenue as you can see the lyric states in the first week of March there was just under 2,000 passenger numbers went through when I pretenses and the last week of March that doctor three hundred food so that 's a great indicator of the decline in actor and in regards to other past the organization we expect we 'll see we started to see something that 's in my and they actually like to the closure of facilities waiting for that for a night or every keep each other so while you saw something technical months they 're really starting other questions electricity consumption we 've got the unit issues but I just wondering if we can get a bit of a whole like the savings we might be near with the with Iran solar panels and that on electricity to line up the billing periods but we don 't really get much indication I 'm getting calls from Rene director and ours is we can provide a briefing that counsel on claiming something that just a question if I may on the last page of the attachment with the current investments that we have mr. O 'Doul to have an indication of how much we might actually be taking a hit in respects to the downturn of the other knee projection currently on reducing income and I 'm on our interest earnings by directly impacted by investments around 700,000 next year thank you know based on race and projected cash inflows cancel the Corbeau mr. me a question is boto in someone tell me what judo thankies figure it out page 13 it 's a newest that deals a lot with businesses there are not my lender and opera they 're relatively new that being operating for about four years and currently around the business sector so a supplementary question there are deposits with this yes thank you cast okay media was kidding I just just to add on two counts of Cornwall 's questions online posted in this is do they Bank is unrated in the current credit rating is that gonna have any possible impact later on unrated mean that they haven mean they 're not supported and had the same requirements as other institutional lenders regarding the amount of capital that they have to maintain the liquidity ratios all that they 're under the same basically management schemes is your Westpac Commonwealth and things like that unrated mains that they use their own money so they don 't need a rating where as lenders they go out to the market and buy money that money then has to be weighted so don 't get concerned when it says uninvited what does it mean that they wish you and you riskier than the rate it was rated means where they get the money okay bottom CCS like five rights 22 mr. mayor counselor for inter that 's a very I 'm just on page 38 of the copy that I have here inventions the in the just before the table in the last paragraph they 're forecast implications associated with these initiatives could cost the city up to 3.6 million and an outline below I mean when we say could cost the city are we suggesting that it could blow out to change by a daily and weekly basis and as this is we don 't have any precedents to go against and what and every day we get new updates for economic impact yes it could blow it out or it could be less it mr. CEO subsequently mr. seriousiy sorry theoretically that that should be premise that the table that you see their table a most of this is about our loss of fees so the numbers you see in the column roughly what we receive you know prep prior years so the only figure that would be a big thing it would be the three percent rates incentive what that number would be that could be wolf who knows terms on how many people pay does that make sense them just a subsequent wish to that mr. mayor for Kenseth and just the question I suppose the elephant in the room is with the reintroduction of all the re deploying of staff at the council is that going to affect the forecast at this stage no I 'm just conscious that this is a public forum and I 'm that the majority of staff are now back at work and we are utilizing 20 staff that I 've moved to capital projects than their building footpaths for us as we speak which takes them off our operational budget and we still do have a number of vacant positions that simply won 't be filled so yeah yeah not too big an impact and we 're talking here revenue as opposed to the expenditure I guess well thank you thank you for that mr. SIA questions okay on the fourth line it 's it 's is there that the exception will be for a small handful of properties that have been subject to a very valuation in 1920 do you have any idea what that small handful of properties means like we 're talking five or the death you would be based on them on rate base which is paying 30 fares and out of 46 men I would say it would be a handful of properties at the most very very low valuation talking about those properties and the plan additions or and that sort of sort of would was the normal course that there 's been a change in the valuation of the property it 's basically if there 's been any changed for that property so yeah it 's morning thank you thinking that the value of general is slated to be revaluing all Geraldton and residential properties during this panic upcoming financial year for application to race in the 2122 budget so that 'll make things like rates discounts upfront we 're not very very difficult because as we hit a revaluation in next year no matter how many people you give a discount to they liked still get arise and everything in between mr. mayor question council tabby Sultana is the state government locked into doing the revaluations next financial year and that weld is still pushing to have them postponed most differently in this trap okay cancel pakka Chancellor haha yeah I haven 't discussion the other day with a person that was definitely me who was telling us the last four or five years they 're giving about 20 percent of their rights in the first month the Olding seem to pay their hundred sixty thousand and that was one of the proposals I 'm sort of I know we 've got to give them incentive because there 's not going to be any charges or interest on any late payments and that but realistically we we 're gonna be in dire straits with the airport you know what 's happened with virgin now is going to make it even harder for local we 've got eight eight weeks grace with the government helping us here but as you say there could be only five or six people on the planet each time you know we 've got staff out there so the guarantee for heirs work and that but realistically to get 660,000 are we really going to achieve that much by giving people 3% I know in The Temper simplest motive last week I was dead against it and still everything because I think the biggest thing that a lot of us came in there 's sort of two keepers rates as low as we can and what 's happened now with the Komen it 's kind of hard you can really going on the other question is I believe that we just go back to normal rates where we are no what I give people incentive your question counselor counselors will why give people incentives the 3% in subject yeah no discount is give surety of cash inflows times and that 's the reason why we 're offering it we get just under around 50% of rates paid by the due date and it 's very critical in regarding to managing cash employees there and our business realize that both initial cashing for 50% any impacts or any changes to that or lowering of that you know liquidity position at risk so it was one way of ensuring you know we would have a win if we maintain even with the discount that we still get the same amount in bother do day so it 's an incentive as you said you know if you 're going to take away the penalty side of things then that anyone smart enough knows well I 've got 12 months the payment rates and that could really impact our cash inflows so what get that flashing fill up front because we only have a certain amount of cash through my own operational so we 're very high risk area for us on actually next year one of the additional things of course the state government and was to accelerate capital works programs and stimulate the economy during the recovery phase well if you don 't collect your cash until June and following year you 're going to miss the recovery phase with cash he won 't get that lender for projects you might be able to build new assets and you 'll actually miss the recovery phase so early will allow us to stimulate the economy as in winter it the recovery occurs which by all intents and purposes probably only a matter a few months away probably coincidentally somewhere around the order of women the race notices are due for payment but question counsel I 'm here mister man and so planning 2.63 percent discount why the figure 3 percent procedures you could you tell me that please third out this will figure based on what we see we could in a the biggest principles that we 're trying to put in place and actually his budget is to maintain our cash position you know at the moment over the next 12 months to a month the simple thing is cash is king and we 're trying to provide a preserve our cash position and we thought 3% was a reasonable amount to provide an incentive and an amount that we could forego it 's a little frustrating to me that we 've sort of got a flag bees and then we sit back in a couple of months and set the budget so how closely do we have to follow these what if these recommendations once we 've passed them if they have because I noticed they are considered whether it is actually mr. CEO so cancer Club yes but we believe it 's unfortunate as well normally your budgets that prepare you know the budget workshops happen we get into the concept forums we all meet we go around the table and we say what 's everyone think etc etc unfortunately with the lockdown that 's been very difficult to lot harder all the thought was this time we put these up and it does say consider it 's not locking anything in but you know with the officers need to get guidance from counselors so they can prepare a budget in time for your June meeting so they 're the sort of things we 're talking to balance but we can 't use words like you know we 're doing to resolve or any of those things this is guidance at this point because you 've still got to see the other side of the equation and determine whether you 're happy with what the total package looks like okay so clearly they obviously a radical departure from the from the ill from the long term financial plan so it 's not either there 's it did visca how much reason also should be deployed to doing that but also from a public perspective I know what I spend on my day doing and it 's answering what are you doing about what are you doing about what are you waving what are you doing we have state government have media telling us to cut them so some of it some regards it 's a bit of surety that we 're at least considering these things in the eyes and if it is a bit of a departure well if we put it out the public is 3% whatever the number is it gives a chance to test the court of public opinion in some regards mr. Howe think through some of these things might be because they are uncharted and they are definitely a doctor reduction and also allows officers to go away and do some scenario modeling to go back to counselors and counselors can then review and give consideration to how to budget but with these proposed initiatives so it gives us some sorority when we go away inside putting the budget together and to give you some different scenarios and the impacts of these counselor so Castle Parker yeah well it 's a funny thing health everything 's turned around we were talking about one and a half percent increase five weeks ago now we 've coming back the other way reversing the cycle now percent for those people that can pay up front in the first month what are we going to be like in 12 months we 're going to be asking them for three or four percent increase to get money back this is in next year 's budget that 's what I 'm worried about with with we 're going from one scenario to the other we 're trying to say best we can we 've cut out capital works for the time being that will come back into play when things start us straight very I 'm sort of thing and the economy 's starting to move a bit but we just could be wary and what we 're spending around town questions please butch cancel bio the question answers here we are we would return an array of six weeks of work I was the only one that said no freeze rates now everyone wants to give them a donation what is cancer do keeps making statements and debating given it 's frustrating in the way I know the budget think that we 've got to hold it you of page 37 it says there the significant revenue streams and they come to roughly 11 million but on the on the paragraph in front of that it 's talking about a 17 million dollar long-term financial plan forecast loss so are there some other significant so my question is are there some other significant revenue streams at an on this sheet I threw it out you 've got title a which deals with 3.6 million of initiatives and then yep I wondered with eleven men is just highlight the significant variances that could be expected in when you define that adds up to about fifteen million the other two meeting are other web new strains but it 's my place what I 'm trying to do is just highlight in the eleven me in the rules the ones that really have big impact the other two means all the other revenue streams that we have across the organization what I security plan seems like like I don 't know the answer is excuse if it 's a laboratory that exhibits not what 's the 2.5 million dollar Murray landfill to is that for budgeting purposes in start wigs we 've gone to the lowest point so basically with Monroe we 've looked at the major revenue streams which tend to be a genuine waste and mixed waste and the biggest customer is the city itself so we started in a lot of point let 's not decide that we as we go through the budget process these these figures will be adjusted up as a start point we belong to the lowest or as you say the worst scenario it 's basically they 're all the major impacted also it takes in consideration and it 's against the long term financial plan and forecast for 2021 in that forecast in 2021 we had a growth factor and we had five innings and charges as well okay I just give it a quick i 'll call visit the purposes of the meeting as we 're getting towards you counsel thomas you prison please use your messaging we 've rich yes still with you yep yep still here gets a call about LC yep yeah we 'll just resolves and so question on that this one different is that okay you did okay i 'm why are we not when we 're talking terms a discounted rates why are we not acknowledging that part of the motivation to do that ought to be the fact that the community has a reduced capacity to pay due to the impact of coronavirus mr. CEO and thank you for the question well we are we are counselor in all of these initiatives all these suggestions with with their that that in mind the state government the premier wrote to us and requested that councils freeze rates and charges and wave or the associated penalties so the council 's that I 've spoken to deploying or attempting to comply with that request yes so that the three percent is to as discuss the forest specifically about trying to get our cash flows it 's if we can says this dis budget is so unpredictable we really don 't know what the future holds normally we can present a budget to we 're fairly confident in being able to deliver this one but we just don whether they if the restrictions or not and how long the restrictions are there it 's set for etc so we 're just having a best guess if you like or a best you know professional judgment and we 're looking for some guidance from the council as to how you see it playing out I should say that you can expect an operational deficit you know initially it 's somewhere between five and ten million next year because because of the significant drop in revenue which is associated with the community 's ability to pay mr. mee a counselor Cornwell just supplementary for clarification is full of everything we 've proposed here in relation to why we 're discounting rates it 's about bringing forward an incentive to pay early we 're not saying anything here about how we 're acknowledging a reduced capacity in the community to pay that was that was the question I was asking we take that as an advanced question asked I think you fall isn 't it okay because it affects it may affect counselors thinking if they take that into account as the gender for sorry councillor tani tani thanks mr. Muir probably a question for director Lee at what stage will we be advised on what capital works and renewals we will be able to do in the next financial year I know that 's probably very difficult for him to answer because there are a lot of imponderables but I 'll give it a go okay yeah once we finish the looking at operating position and the impacts in cash then I normally go to direct early in time much money he 's got to spend there are services there opposed to the [Laughter] tenants thank you little Nike thanks everybody _"

    "text": "good afternoon jeremy ashamed n Stein here I 'm providing you a budget update what the city is doing in relation to the financial impacts of Kovach 19 and second of April 20 2009 the city forecast a budget surplus of 100,000 in the media budget review Roberts slightly increase at around 160,000 however with a significant plummeting in fees particularly for place like the airport the ocarina and theater the sea is now forecasting a deficit of 3 million dollars that is balanced by 3 million in savings however the six million dollar drop in revenue they were experiencing is significant and this will see us have to rein in a number of control measures to ensure our city remains fine to sustainably but now into the future it is expected that under these conditions that has at the 30th of June 2020 the city will have enough cash in reserve to fund operations for a mere three months prior to raise collections to help combat this expected squeeze on our cash position the city 's frame is 2021 budget as we speak already we 've directed the CEO and charges to waive all installment fees and charges to remove or paid parking and to suspend the application of all relate rates and charges are going on the 2021 year we want to be able to bring up the capacity to bring back services as quick as possible and that is why we are also continue to review measures every month of our council meetings see what further measures we can take to ensure the sustainability of your city but also in alleviate as much burden as we can to a wider community in assisting this the city has recently announced we 'll be shrinking our contractor payment terms from 30 days to 7 days just to help those organizations get through but let 's not beat around the bush the city is expecting a 10 million decrease in revenue next financial year we will be able to offset this by some operational savings as a result of lock downs and stand downs but the final impacts of those are still being modeled today these are serious numbers of serious times and that 's why the city mayor remains else are we doing here you ask well the city is lobbying the federal state government who had today have done a great job in responding to Co mid-nineteen however all of the stimulus measures announced and job keeper allowances do not apply to local government so we 'll be working both directly with our local members as well through organizations such as regional capitals Australia to try and Lobby the government to provide assistance to local government because if we see our revenue drop by 20 30 40 percent our local governor would no longer be able to provide many of the services which we all take for granted we 've also approached the W Treasury asking them to freeze current loans outstanding to them in the same way that the big commercial banks have provided relief to businesses we think that council should be treated any differently to a business we do run a budget much like business and we think we should be treated as such thank you for your patience in this time and please provide comments as to what you like to see as to 'll continue IG updates on the C 's factual situation as they unfold i 'ma show you Ben Stein stay safe stay at home you _"

    "text": "yeah everyone miss Shane Dienst on here presenting the budget for 1920 the City of Greater Jordan will be staying on track and improving our suburbs so the budget fundamentals just use is all about being business as usual there 's no new major projects but there 's also no new debt and we 'll be retaining a surplus of just about 85,000 we have had to cut out growth rate from the sea from one percent to zero-point-five percent that 's reflected in a few less building approvals as we look through and forward to the year rate rises are projected to be 1.5 percent this year which is down from a projected 2.5 percent and this will be ongoing indeed we don 't see rate rises moving above inflation of 1.5 percent for at least next four years reassuringly it 's not a revaluation year meaning that right rise will be consistent across all properties and the biggest expense we have this year is depreciation from new assets a 1.1 million dollars affecting the operating statement which is why after all we are not looking any new major here we have the sea of Greater jobs long-term financial plan and as you can see down the bottom the net result from ordinary activities we are expecting a budget surplus for next 10 years and modest revenue growth throughout there 's a number of assumptions we 've modeled into our forecast and as you can see the big one there is the rates growth in ranked base up around operating revenues where we 're predicting a growth rate of 0.5 0.6 percent all at 2.8 percent in 28 29 that 's a significant reduction in the former growth estimates of around one and a half to one percent and it 's reflective us needing to fund that by reducing our expenditure as we move forward and also the top the numbers everyone looks at rates you 'll see we 're projecting rates increases of 1.5% through to around 2% in 28 29 and again that 's largely funding increases and employee costs and materials and contracts through the ford estimates and again utility charges insurances continue to grow by around 5 percent per annum and that 's something we about revenue overall revenue will be eighty three point five million dollars which is actually in rates comprising forty six point nine million dollars of that which is actually only a 1.3 percent increase from last year 's budget however that is made up of one point five percent rise in gross rental values basically residential houses which we offset by a two percent overall decrease in improved value rates or indeed those farming properties and we also receive grants and subsidies of 8.2 million dollars other fees and charges include twenty four point seven million dollars and this is largely your rubbish charge and Airport fees and charges there is going to be a 52 increase in the residential rubbish collection fees this year as we look to roll out recycle in particular the food and organics trial that we an 18 increase for commercial rubbish collection which basically aligns the two fees is at the moment commercial operators pay more than residential and it 's with exactly the same service will be one hundred and twenty thousand dollars less in parking revenue if we roll out a two there across the sea of greater German and we also look to reduce the parking fees charged for those parking lots they 're still charging once again for about a third in a row we 've frozen a corner fees and we 've also frozen the landing fees here at the airport keeper defects expenditure will be up 2.2 percent which is an expenditure of about eighty three point four million dollars the EBA wage rise of 1.8% will apply to staff wages over elected members in the CEO will be saving a 0% pay rise effectively freezing our pay for the third year in a row depreciation as mentioned earlier is up 1.1 million dollars with new projects from 2018-19 now that 's offset by materials and contractors which is going to decrease by two hundred and ninety thousand dollars and that is largely as a result of us getting on top of our renewal projects that is all that decaying infrastructure speed replaced with new stuff means we save a significant volume of money and overall that repairs leads to a 400,000 saving on top of that two saved by actually getting on top of our maintenance here at the city the forego trial is will be rolled out to five hundred houses and we 're aiming for it to be successful we are budgeting that over a four full year rollout we will have that at every property in Geraldton a second bin and initially that 'll cost two hundred and seventy thousand dollars and a once-off this year election cost it comes around every couple of years of a hundred thousand we 're also reducing our council numbers we 'll save the budget 58,000 this graph simply shows our overall where all the money is spent as is quite clear are there the roads pathways of street lighting some 37% of all our expenditure and 16% of parks and 9% on rubbish and all those are the little are bits and pieces that make up how our money is spent so current budget new capital six point nine million dollars the city will continuous CVD revitalization of 750,000 HMAC need to gives us long-awaited toilets three hundred and fifty thousand the Abraham Street path a project see 400,000 spent out that way as well as upgrades at Forrester Park Graham 's reserve and Levy Street but also the doulica Maitland new section plant planning and possibly construction of around about three hundred thousand dollars dependent on grants other new capital includes a Spaulding urban renewal program with just four hundred and fifty three thousand dollars for that a new paths in Spaulding Xenia Street Lantana Tama Digby lots of Plaza in range way 196,000 as well as our coastal hazard and risk management panicked ation planning measures of five hundred thousand dollars basically tackling erosion and finally the two bigger items in the current new budget is the Arthur Road alignment they 're down near the airport which is grant funded for 1.3 million dollars and the Cape Burnie free holding one point five six million dollars entirely funding from the sale of those Lots so as well as new capital we also spend over 20 million dollars in renewing our capital assets this year some 7.26 million dollars will be spent on those major roads in their urban areas as listed below we 'll be path from Bailey Street to Kohl 's express our paths on 3rd Street and Hoskins street but parks seeing our forester park basketball court the skate park renewed Olive Street we 'll get some additional landscaping to combat some of the dial from plants there but also brand high level receive a new median strip which is actually all about reducing operating costs so this slide shows where all the our renewal program is typically funded and where it is and again no surprise our roads and the significant proportion of what we spend our money on here at sea of Greater Geraldton after a new program key portfolio trends what you can see from an large number this is we 're continuing to increase the amount of money we spend on renewals year-on-year and the occasional splashes as a result of either inclement weather events or insurance claims but overall there 's a clear trend that when you increase the amount we spend on asset renewal here 's some examples of some dilapidated bus shelters and dilapidate Scott skate parks that need attention or being addressed in this year on Northwest Coast Ohio exactly why we need to focus on our footpaths because they create a clear and present safety danger to people using them and a long-overdue for renewal there 's also mirror older car parks old toilet blocks they 've exceeded their useful life and clearly out there at first a parker bus will court there 's just not safe to play on will be renewed in this year 's budget but not all of these things are funded by rates we do get one point five million dollars off the state and another one point three from the Commonwealth as awesome two point five are to fix up the airport funds but other proceeds including a pony free holding of titles we 're basically selling the Lots to the owners also a little bit of trades in trade ins and reserves for vehicle to fund it so as you see we don 't get too much from the state and Commonwealth but we have to make do what we can for our fees and charges and rates the long-term financial plan again rate increases have been 10 years that 's based purely on expected costs movements we 're not trying to increase large reserves or make large profits this is purely reflective of our costs we want to realize all our sustainable stainability ratios within 10 years and closing our annual gap and he 's just getting on top of our maintenance within the next 5 years but also will be definitely slowing down contraction on your capital expenditure so over the 10 years we 'll be allocating 255 million dollars to the renewal expansion over the over the over the life of that plan 18 million for new items 141 million dollars to road infrastructure 31 million on pass 48 million on coastal parks recreation and 14 million dollars on drainage big numbers that show just house a bigger job it is in delivering this year 's budget looking at to the long-term this year will be providing a 2 million dollar cash reserve for the provision of waste diversion infrastructure that 's set to Fogo trial so if this is rolled out successfully we 'll have a reserve that that 'll at CSP on a new landfill in 2627 to be around 3.6 million dollars but some big coastal projects we know there 's going to need to be some work done at sunset and potentially out there at Drummond 's we 'll be seeing a sort of like million dollars that in 2627 as well as capping those landfill cells for million dollars but you know on the bright side we will have 10 million dollars set aside why and how to use for any new major projects that may come up and be needed by our city this graph purely just shows a number of ratios that we 're making and really the only area of concern is that we 're not meeting 90% of our assets sustainably ratio that is we need to be spinning at least the equivalent of 90 percent are of rates on our asset maintenance and we only just below that but we are working towards getting there here 's some roadworks profiles going forward over the next 10 years and as you can see a clear trend there on renewal there 's an increasing trend and be a main focus of our city but the trend downwards on you there they 're showing a downward trend as we look to consolidate what we 've got and hopefully create some urban infill footpaths and Psyche ways again a clear trend in renewal expenditure someone coming down a little bit here because we 've got on top of me we 've really focused on creating our footpaths they 've fixed them I hope the last couple of years meaning we can slow down our renewal and in the alternative we can look to increasing the amount of new footpaths we roll out through our suburbs because we 're well aware that many of our suburbs don 't have any footpaths at all this graphs a little confusing at first but it just shows where we spend our on your budget forecast is out to 2038 again an increasing trend in renewables as we get on top of looking after our aging infrastructure so for full details you can just simply google the sea of graded to written budget follow the link on this presentation and thank you for listening _"

    "text": "so I 'm Mandy and I run my family daycare business in Geraldton which is in the mid west of western australia so being a family day care educator for around four and a half years now and I look after seven children in tow to each day during the dates for under five and then I had three school-age before and after school children so to do a family day care you need a certificate three or working towards one in childcare services I 've gone on to do my diploma in childcare services which i think is great for any future career options that I would like to achieve so I think that I 'm being qualified as a family day care educator helps you be more professional about your job I gives you more knowledge and so it actually in turn makes your job easier in the long run so I really love being a family day care educator because it 's like you 've just got an extended family it 's wonderful their children become like your own and you 've got the interactions with all being home for your own children that was one of the main reasons I went back into it because I can be here for my own children it 's a great career professionalism you can extend yourself and also the money is really really good the benefits of families using a family day care is that their children are in a smaller group they 've got a variety of Ages they interact in everyday living environments also the family so it had and child care entitlements from the government just about every family would get an entitlement of some kind there 's lots available out there for them yes i 'm christine i live in geraldton which is in the midwest region of western australia initially my firstborn my daughter was in family day care now she 's a school-age child so she attends family daycare just on a casual basis but my son who 's two and a half he attends family day care currently there 's a couple of reasons that I 've chosen family daycare over a larger center one of the things I specifically like about who are under school age as the maximum number at any time that leads me to think that it 's much closer to one-on-one care and so I like that a lot also when you send your child to family day care you know that they 're going to have a more natural environment so Troy a tense family day care and he just gets to do the things that he would do at home so he has the access to play equipment he has a routine he has things such as just going out into the garden doing you know some gardening he gets to cook and make some food he gets to go an excursion to the library you know different things like that which would be what I would normally do with him at home if I was at home with him and the flexibility for family day care I find can be a lot greater than day care centers because the hours vary and also for things such as in the event that you are going to be very late or in the event that your night care things like that as well so the flexibility is greater for me I think it 's a very positive thing that the daycare providers are working towards those qualifications in child care I think that it makes you think that instead of just being a glorified babysitter there 's actually some structure and some programming in place and I think just with kids getting more and more prepared to go into kindergarten school and things like that then that 's kept a closer islands so you know that your children are doing some exposure to all of the basic education things that they would do if you were their parent at home well look Troy has developed a gorgeous relationship with Mandy she is another caregiver in his in his life and so that relationship is very special he 's developed a relationship also with all of the other children that attend daycare so the four of them as a small group they 're very close-knit and he looks forward to coming and seeing them on a daily basis Mandy runs a really good family day care she toys and she rotates them on a basis that keeps the kids really interested and his favorite things to do she often cooks with the children and she also does some gardening things that they 've grown some vegetables and things like that which he really loves and one of his other favorite things is the excursion on a weekly basis they go to the library and he looks forward to that all the time look I know there 's a lot of options available to people but for me this options so it 's beautifully it it means that I have some flexibility it means that my child is cared for on a very close relationship level and I think that that would appeal to a lot of parents and it 's a great option another thing that I particularly like about family daycare is that instead of attending a large Center where a group of children of the same age group has kept together in a room I like a much more natural approach where the children might be of varying ages and I think that 's very my first child she was an only child for quite a long time and that exposure to other children and developing you know that relationship with those other children I found it very natural very very much like you would have in the home environment which is definitely why choose family date over a daycare center you _"

    "text": "you Miley Mara means good hands or safe hands and in regards to the to animal welfare they are always in good hands with their pet owners and in case of an emergency when you need to leave home you can take the animals to be in safe hands on saturday the sixth of jun 2015 the City of Greater geraldton conducted an emergency exercise operation band Amara the aim of the exercise was to test the response to the activation of an emergency welfare centre and the City of Greater geraldton local animal emergency welfare guidelines 2015 the purpose of a field exercise is to ensure that all agencies are familiar with the geography of the local area surrounds facilities and procedures during an emergency response situation a field exercise also allows response teams the chance to experience real conditions where participants can put their training to the test this DVD will cover the preparation behind operation band Amara exercise and the archives the exercise had the following objectives to appraise the City of Greater Geraldton emergency welfare guidelines and response in line with West plan welfare and the to evaluate responses from the City of Greater geraldton staff and support agencies to examine the activation and management of the incident by the animal welfare coordinator and animal welfare tech to appraise the department for child protection and families supports management of the evacuation center assess the suitability of the success of the Red Cross personal support to victims and registration process assess the response to the incident in terms of resources collaboration and capabilities enable students from jurek institute of technology to integrate their learnings of veterinary nursing with a multiple agency response in an emergency scenario the guidelines recognize the connection between people and animals without such a plan emergency response and recovery can be compromised and furthermore the safety of people can be at risk a significant amount of plan went into the exercise the new guidelines list equipment and logistical needs hence we needed to ensure we had this ready we needed a suitable location stakeholders on board and staff briefed and across the guidelines the exercise had to be as real as possible we needed volunteers animals and agencies present and ready to act collectively we needed to understand where our gaps were in the guidelines our operations our people and equipment to ensure this could be adapted to perform better in a real situation fortunately the pre-planning for the exercise paid off the exercise commences with a briefing whereby all agencies staff volunteers are briefed about safety the scenario the parameters and objectives this exercise had various areas of operation including the animal registration area the animal triage area the dog facility cat facility and livestock area the welfare center which included a registration area kitchen operations and emergency accommodation the date is saturday the tenth of january 2016 and a fire that commenced the previous day in the shire of chapman valley has jumped containment lines and is spreading fast towards the areas of WOD Rakhine Moresby and Rory the incident controller has activated the Department for child protection and family support to set up welfare centres which has been activated by Jesus goes to a fire as approaching skirts with Jordan and then evacuate our people the affected community is now arriving at the welfare Center the Department for child protection to register people it is not long before people start turning up to the center with animals you 're chappie what 's this nice unfortunately we have to feel isolated when did last moment when that happened love your hope look after me go place a burn on the arm on the website ah so yeah my I want the dog where 's my dog see where 's me done I want the dog back hell yeah first come along come on hon at all we 're gonna do our very big I 'll look after us oh good oh good papi as well as testing out a plan of a local animal emergency welfare guidelines like in this case of field exercise such as operation Bodie burrow can allow people in various agencies to build up a knowledge under real-life conditions from a veterinary point of view it was a great idea to see how we would all work under pressure but importantly for how much equipment you would need to bring you don 't know what 's coming at you being prepared for all events would be important an opportunity to put their own knowledge and skills to the test and I think that one of the biggest lessons which I saw helped one of the residents I said to him we need to get you well so that you can be there for your dog soon as i said that kind of kicked in so that was one thing I take away but what can I say to this man for the paramedic to attend to his injuries so that seemed to work it helps to iron our problems or areas that need improvement within the agencies or teams there 's a few things that we could do one of them is when we impound the dogs in a facility like the one we had today is to have somebody there try some monitoring those dogs and making sure no no get out or anything for the welfare of the dogs and that also assists with the the people that drop them off they know somebody 's there looking after him it helps to build communication with different agencies encourages people to manage problems and find solutions a real life incident and it allows management teams to assess their operational staff from a distance there 's a lot of learning for us today we had a couple of unaccompanied minors attends we have to take under our wings and monitor and keep an eye on and on in an english-speaking person who attended so I provide information especially good as what 's having back in there in their subject such as providing welfare support we don 't do that alone we deal with our partners in Red Cross CWA people turned up to provide the cave me a swap a local welfare plan for the City of Greater Jordan and I want to congratulate the City of Greater geraldton for thinking proactively about what to do with animals people will turn up to evacuation centers with their animal it adds to the trauma I 've already a traumatic event if people can 't_''_539.209 be with their animals or they 're thinking constantly about the animals and they put themselves at risk a hot debrief occurs directly after the exercise we 're agency heads and umpires discuss their quick snapshot of how the day went and some brief comments on how operations could be improved in a real-life situation the key is a plan or guidelines might look good on paper but you have to test them to know what works or what 's missing some of the key outcomes of this exercise is that we could say that communication within and across agencies was excellent we need to alter our guidelines and documentation to certain operational environment we need to acknowledge staffing resource needs for people registration and animal facility management we need to address resource needs such as appropriateness of temporary facilities we need to establish stronger partnerships and mo use with existing partners the exercise enabled us to get a sense of it as close to a real situation as possible and finally we confirm that there was a strong working relationship between agencies we found it a very interesting exercise our ladies are used to catering where is to catering the bush and used to catering without electricity and limited water and things like that it was even more important to us regarding the in Victoria my husband and I went some years back to as part of the bushfire relief in just south of sale and the stories that I heard as a counselor in regards to the affected of the animals getting hurt and the rescuing some of them would would put their life down for the animal and would actually stay with the animal and and rather than leave them by themselves some of them had to get into their cars in a hurry had to pick up whenever animals they could find and and leave their houses and of course it was a crime scene her away for 45 days so they really didn 't know if their animals were alive or dead so what we 've had today that the city of Geraldton has organized has been absolutely fantastic because the different agencies whether they 're to do with the animals Yvette 's the dog rescue or whether it 's to do with the people with the Red Cross and Russell seed every way providing that the food I think it 's been an excellent day operation Banda Mara capacity to respond to the activation of a welfare centre with animal welfare requirements the outcomes of the exercise will work toward improvements to the local animal emergency welfare guidelines and how agencies will respond and work together in a real-life situation the City of Greater Geraldton has always liked to be an innovator in relation to everything that it does and this exercise in relation to animal management is certainly no exception to the rule the work that our staff have done and the work contributed by the agencies that support local emergency management here at the city has been terrific and I 'd like to thank them sincerely for the work that they 've done you you you _"

is strategically located between Perth and the growing economies of the state 's northern regions as a central hub between the resource-rich Pilbara the growing Kimberley and the state 's capital Shelton and the greater Midwest are central to a diverse range of economic opportunities geralyn 's vision is to be a city that is built around a rich fabric of diversity and to be attractive to people from all walks of life Manufacturing health retail construction agriculture education and mining are the business sectors where the largest number of local people are employed with a lower than average unemployment rate Geraldton is the base of a strong and diverse business sector with a variety of business opportunities attracting new people to the city agriculture and fishing alone bringing nearly 1 billion dollars annually to the Midwest with agriculture worth almost the most valued and significant industries in the region a strong international demand for commodities has already underpinned significant resources investment in the region with many more projects planned for startup in the next few years as well as the growth of the mining and resources sector there are also a host of large-scale infrastructure projects expected to commence in the near future these projects are diverse in nature and will provide opportunities for both short and long term employment in the region don 't needs a service center for the entire Midwest region which is proven to be both a resilient and really diverse economy from our perspective there 's never been a better time to be in business in Geraldton as where you can provide a whole range of different services to the entire North West and Midwest of Western Australia diversity and partnerships is the key to future economic success with the City of Greater Charlton working closely with all forms of local businesses in creating a model for success not just in Geraldton with the greater surrounding region joltin is currently experiencing a significant economic expansion place where the local government businesses and community support a vision of expansion sustainability and livability for the city a shared vision that will no doubt drive a vibrant jelton and its surrounding region for many years to come you when the time comes to decide where you 're going to stop home no doubt one of the biggest deciding factors for a family is the quality of the region 's schooling system now Jaron is well known for having one of the best schooling systems in the state from early learning right through to university so when the time comes to make that big decision about education Geraldton is right up there with the best Geraldton offers a variety of education options and hosts 14 government and 7 private schools in total there are around 50 quality education and care services in Shelton with Shelton 's Education diversity there are numerous options available with state-of-the-art facilities and support services providing the best education possible across several campus spaces when it comes to education options the Geraldton University Center is a success story that speaks for itself the first of university programs by supported distance education blending the latest in online technology with face-to-face learning experiences the center 's objective is to facilitate deliver promote and provide access to university education for students in the Midwest and is the first point of contact in the region when seeking information on University study the appeal is studying here the GDC is obviously it 's a lot cheaper to study here rather than in Perth also the support of my family they always make sure you know that I 'm always doing my study and giving me that support to do my work also the classes are a lot smaller so in the lectures and the tutorials the relationships you have with your lecturers and your peers are a lot better and so you get a lot more support through that as well the Geraldton University Center provides an atmosphere for learning that is unique to the higher education system providing an intimate and supportive learning community in a regional setting that is enjoyed by many one of the big pluses here is that a majority of the students who study at jelton they also gain employment as professionals in their chosen field in one of W a 's most livable regional centres names of the West Australian large training provider of the year in 2010 and being a finalist in 2011 and 2012 the Jurek Institute of Technology is one of the state 's leading vocational education and training providers with training offered in health through to construction Shelton 's jurrac campus is the major provider of vocational education and training in the Midwest the Institute has established itself as a successful quality driven training provider and over the years has received numerous awards and acknowledgments for its courses and students Jurek continues to deliver excellence in training and has become a regular finalist in the West Australian large training provider awards over the past five years in a location such as Geraldton campuses like Jurek 's Batavia coast maritime Institute are really important in providing a training pathway to local industry the impressive campus is located right here on the coast at separation point and is recognized as the quality training research and development facility on the doorstep of one courses in environmental science conservation and land management and aquaculture both on campus and on relevant sites appropriate to course structures so what we focus on is making sure that students work on real-world projects and they work very closely with industry partners as one example students in the conservation land management program work on projects at the braless Islands these programs lead to development of real management plans for the islands what it means from a student 's point of view is that they 're in close contact with potential employers which in turn then improves their chances of gaining employment in their chosen fields the healthy active and socially connected community in Geraldton is one of the main reasons that the city is one of the best places to be educated you don 't need to leave Geraldton after high school as there are universities here that can provide the next level in learning a level that can help in that all-important transition between school and the workforce you we 've spoken about why gelatin is such a great place to live and there 's obviously no shortage with its varied economy and great plans for the future Geraldton is also becoming a profitable and enjoyable location for investors as well as existing and new residents for people who are interested in investing in a forward-thinking city renowned for providing a quality lifestyle real estate in joltin provides an ideal opportunity Geraldton is a city that provides a lifestyle of country living on one of the most beautiful coastlines in the country there is no shortage of choice when it comes to residential and commercial real estate being so close to the coast you 've been forgiven for thinking that Geraldton was far away from the hub of business and industry but despite its location which offers both a rural and coastal lifestyle jelton is the center of an urban hub with local shops education precincts and so much more so you can still experience all the perks of a city without the hustle and bustle Geraldton is one of the best places to live on the west coast and there is no shortage of quality land available new and established homes are very affordable if you 're property both existing and new is readily available at the moment joltin the Midwest diversity is the key to sustainability for longer term investment we find that we 're not reliant on any one industry certainly mining is important to us and the potential for that going forward but we also find that the farming industries the fishing industries along with our growing tourism and aquaculture industries are very important and underpin the stability of the market we also find that at the moment the affordability for housing and if you couple that with low interest rates that seems to be good opportunities for investors going forward when investing in the future of Geraldton there are many other reasons other than real estate that will appeal to people considering moving here what 's happening here at jelton port from a substantial growth perspective is the perfect example of increased investment from overseas markets into the region for example this port has created its own niche market for the export of iron ore in smaller ships to shallow-draft ports in China with jelton proximity to Asia making the port an attractive its diversity in addition to catering for exports of minerals grains and livestock the port also welcomes cruise ships and is a big supporter of the Midwest 's lucrative fishing industry Frey growth has been spectacular in recent years we undertook a dredging program in 2002 2003 which deepened the harbor and allowed us to get bigger vessels into the port and that has meant that we 've seen massive increase in iron ore exports as well up to six hundred percent trade growth since 2002 2003 but while we continue to support the iron ore industry we 're also supporting the historical trades of our metal concentrates agriculture and fishing as investment in the region increases the Geraldton port will continue to play a major role in making this happen through its greatest strengths in strong partnerships with its customers but it is not the port alone that will attract new investors to Geraldton the City of Greater Charlton and local community will continue to work together to encourage further investment across all industries whether it be local or overseas markets and this continued joint commitment will no doubt work study and set up home over the next 50 years Geraldton will continue to undergo a transformation from a small regional city into a large diverse and exciting place to live supported by a variety of different economic and community activities the city will become a cultural economic and social base in its own right but it will still remain the idyllic seaside city that people recognize as Geraldton well that 's Geraldton and another great West Ozzie location wrapped up for our town now make sure you jump on our Facebook page and check all the latest updates on our travels and be sure to keep an eye out for us next time where we 'll see you somewhere in W a _"

    "text": "like other local governments around Australia the City of Greater geraldton is challenged with balancing the needs and aspirations of its community with its ability to pay so in 2009 the city embarked on an ambitious program called 20-29 and Beyond engaging more than 3,000 people in a plan for the city 's future a key outcome was that citizens wanted ongoing involvement in decision-making especially about how the money is spent so hashtag changes cgg was born a project to embed participate or budgeting and deliberative democracy in the decision-making process panels comprising local people chosen at random from the greater geraldton community are the foundation of the city 's new budgeting process helping develop criteria and prioritizing expenditure on capital works and the range and level of services provided over the local going for 28 years and I see often councils making decisions that don 't necessarily line the community 's expectations or the community 's values I see this is a fantastic process to bring that alignment to make sure that what we deliver as a council is it 's consistent with what the community wants from win-win for the community to link to the council what we 're trying to do and this is really different is to get people to understand that dilemmas the problems the complexity of what the city has to deal with all the time and the council and to get them involved enough in that process that they are able to come up with our response that is very community-based that is based on their community values on on how they see the world but at the same time understands enough of the complexity to be able to do that sense of Lee I think I think from our perspective it 's actually added so much value and rigor into our assess assessment criteria unless you actually go and ask the community what is it that you value you can 't really reflect those values into the interior projects that you do and the services you provide oh I think the input from the community is very important sometimes decisions can be made by counsel alone and I think it opens up other opportunities if the community is having a say what was your first thought so even you received the call um well with a sense of pride with the council i would say because there are bridges the gap between the community and the council 's workers I was worried it 'd be a bit like a mining safety meeting where the management basically say what they want and then you say what you want and then the management just do what they want anyway smelly but it 's turned out to be very much the opposite of that so it 's um it 's reassuring to say the least ask I had no idea of the enormity nor the feeling of being involved which i think is to me it 's one most important things it 's really good because you can tell that people want to know what you 're thinking in the questions that would be given allow us to say what we think deciding where our money goes it 's probably the extreme end of empowerment because normally that is not a place where citizens get to go that 's a place that 's given it 's important you got on the council having the balls to do something like this you _"

    "text": "you got on the council having the balls to do something like this like other local governments around Australia the City of Greater Geraldton is challenged with balancing the needs and aspirations of its community with its ability to pay so in 2009 the city embarked on an ambitious program called 2029 and beyond engaging more than 3000 people in a plan for the city 's future a key outcome was that citizens wanted ongoing involvement in decision making especially about how the money is spent so hashtag changes CGG was born a project to embed participating budgeting and deliberative democracy in the decision-making process panels comprising local people chosen at random from the greater Geraldton community are the foundation of the city 's new budgeting process helping develop criteria and prioritizing expenditure on capital works and the range and level of services provided changes is really about putting some rigor around those aspirations in terms what the community can afford to pay for and reasonably expect to be delivered over a period of time we then want to get the community involved in in setting the criteria to decide priority of which project comes first and which project comes like and I guess that 's how we got to where we are today what we 're trying to do and this is really different is to get people to understand that dilemmas the problem is the complexity of what the city has to deal with all the time and the council and to get them involved enough in that process that they are able to come up with a response that is very community based that is based on their community values on on how they see the world but at the same time understands enough of the complexity to be able to do that sensibly historically local governments have sort of locked away that the capital works budgeting process to the great but City Reta jelton has decided to basically have like the books and share the experience with the community and actually sick Ostrom their communities to help and we should be evaluating at projects targets it 's an incredible step forward I think I think I think from our perspective it 's actually added so much be able to take a bit of a step back and say aha okay what does it really mean you 're actually looking at it from a community perspective you actually trying to give a heart and soul to that local community unless you actually go and ask the community what is it that you value you can 't really reflect those values into their into your projects that you do and the services you provide oh I think the input from the community is very important sometimes decisions can be made by a council alone and I think it opens up other opportunities if the community 's having a say in what 's involved in the decision-making in the future what was your first thought so even you received the call well with a sense of pride with the council I could say because they 're down bridges the gap between the community and the council 's workers I was worried it 'd be a bit like a mining safety meeting where the management basically say what they want and then you say what you want and then the turned out to be very much the opposite of that so that 's reassuring to say the least it 's good I had no idea of the enormity nor the feeling of being involved which I think is to me is my most important things it 's really good because you can tell that people want to know what you 're thinking in the questions that we 've been given allow us to say what we think deciding where our money goes it 's probably the extreme end of empowerment because normally that is not a place where citizens get to go that 's a place that 's given to the experts deep bureaucrats well what citizens need to be there it 's important _"

of joondalup 's 2020 theme emerging stronger two words which have such profound meaning and relevance especially in 2020 a year that has challenged us in so many ways wherever you are right now be it a classroom auditorium or your school undercover area we are all doing our best to smile shine and keep moving forward together emerging stronger means different things to everyone stronger means to me my thoughts immediately shift to young people like yourself listening today you are our change makers future leaders and dynamic entrepreneurs who are yet to spread your wings to their fullest you are the people who have been called to rise to the challenges that hold so much uncertainty and rapid change that we are experiencing in our world at the moment i speak to so many young people and through our conversations it is loud and clear i can see that your focus is sharply placed on how in 2020 you have kept showing up and practicing three essential skills adapting coping and supporting yourself and each other so that you can keep on being your personal best in the face of adversity firstly you have adapted to monumental change you have been adapting even when you did not like what you could see ahead of you in your path and your positivity and optimism has held you steadfast adapting to change is a skill that will be so helpful to you today tomorrow and well into your future you have also coped with extreme that you can handle new information and you can work with situational surprises this is resilience in action your grit when needed the most is an absolute credit to you when you look back on your young life a sense of certainty is probably one of your strongest and most familiar foundations you are now learning to not only cope but to thrive in uncertain times please be proud of that and finally you have supported yourself cared for your friends and your family whether it be face to face or virtually how proud you must be knowing that you have done this all whilst catching curve balls coming in thick and fast in 2020 in this challenging times you have stood up you have adapted you have coped and supported yourself and those around you so please take a moment in your own minds and hearts to celebrate that you rock and rock is r o c a tiny little word that is so connected to the core idea of emerging stronger r is noticing your resilience o is tapping in to your optimism and c is nurturing your so it goes without saying that you have had a year quite like no other but look at you all you 're doing it you 're strong and you 're emerging stronger you are young people who hold the world at your feet albeit a little different to what you may have expected this year you have shown you have what it takes to steer yourself in the direction you want to go so with this in mind i would like to share three guiding tips with you and that is choice care and the power of celebration individually they are practical together they are powerful you all have these three tips available to you 24 7 which means you can choose to use them wherever you are no matter what you 're doing this will help you keep emerging stronger the first tip is choice you have the power to choose what you think from moment to moment it is the quality of your thoughts that can help you stay strong and push you through times that test your confidence and your self-belief be curious and take a moment are they boosting you forward your next thought could be your most important where will your next thought take you and secondly care if we want to emerge stronger i encourage you to give your heart your head and your body the best opportunity to be strong now is the time to check in and make sure you are moving your body eating plenty of mood boosting foods and being around people who have your back appreciate you and care about you and finally the final guiding tip is the power of celebration from day to day you will have small and large wins and moments we have you absolutely reached your personal best don 't let these moments slip by unnoticed because it 's the celebration of small wins that add up and help you to emerge stronger have you noticed how people have been stepping up around you in your community you see in times of struggle we dig deep something you have been doing for several months be proud of that you are the future leaders in our community adults believe in you teachers want to see have exactly what it takes to be strong stay strong and help your friends and family and your school emerge stronger than ever before you are resilient you are optimistic and you are confident believe that keep showing your rockability to the world because your resilience optimism and confidence are outstanding to the young people listening today thank you for emerging stronger romans 5 verses 3 to 5 not only so but we can also glory in our sufferings because we know that suffering produces perseverance perseverance character and character hope and hope does not put us to shame because god 's love has been poured out into our hearts through the holy spirit who has been given to us james chapter 1 verses 2 to 4 says consider it pure joy my brothers and sisters when you face trials of many kinds because you know that the testings of your faith produces perseverance let perseverance finish its works so that you may be mature and complete not lacking anything psalm 37 23-24 the lord makes firm the steps of the one who delights in him though he may stumble his hand deuteronomy 31 6 be strong and courageous

going to show you what porridge is here 's some porridge here it 's made of oats and you put oats into a saucepan with some water or some milk and you stir it around while it gets warm and gets thicker and thicker and thicker and then you have it in a bowl with some sugar and some more milk and that 's porridge in fact porridge is eaten around the world everywhere a national porridge day can you imagine it well let 's start our story so our story begins now sometimes well a lot of stories start with once upon a time so let 's start our story like that too once upon a time in a little village lived a mum and her little girl and one morning the little girl came down to have breakfast and her mum said we don 't have any food today we 're so poor we couldn 't afford any food the little girl said that 's okay she decided to go for a walk instead and they lived right in front of a beautiful forest so she went for a walk in the forest now while she was in the forest she got really really really hungry so she sat down under a tree on some green grass and she had a bit of a cry while she was there crying a little old lady came up to her and asked her why she was crying she explained to her why she was feeling so sad and why she was so hungry the this is a magic porridge pot whenever you feel hungry you just have to say to the magic porridge pot cook little pot cook and the pot will cook the perfect amount of porridge that you need right now and when you 've had enough porridge you just have to say to the pot stop little pot stop and the pot will stop cooking porridge the little girl took the porridge pot home and told her mum about it straight away in fact they sat down at the kitchen table straight away with their bowls and their spoons and can you remember what they had to say they said cook little pot cook and the pot began to cook the most delicious ooey gooey sticky yummy porridge they sat down and they ate it all up and they looked at the pot and they said stop little pot stop and the pot stop cooking porridge now this went on for quite a while and then one day the little girl said i need to go for a walk in the forest again so she went for a walk out into really really really hungry so she sat down at the kitchen table with her bowl and her spoon and she looked at the pot and she said can you remember cook little pot to cook and the pot began to make the most delicious yummy ooey gooey sticky porridge the mum got her bowl and she filled it up and she started eating the porridge straight away she felt so good she looked over at the pot and the pot was still cooking porridge in fact it was bubbling out over the porridge lip onto the table and nearly dripping down my goodness the mum said quit cooking porridge pot but the pot wouldn 't stop cooking the porridge by this stage the porridge had started to rise up up to her knees inside the kitchen and started to ooze out the front door can you see the porridge using out of the front door the mum started to get very very worried and she kept trying to get the pot to stop cooking porridge quit cooking little porridge pot i 've had enough i 'm full but the porridge and more porridge in fact she ran out into the street to get her friends to see if they could help the pot stop cooking porridge they all yelled at the pot stop you little pot you 're silly you shouldn 't cook so much porridge please we 're very full please stop but the porridge pot didn 't stop cooking porridge the porridge began pouring down the whole street right up to the very edges of the town all over the grass it kept cooking porridge and more porridge and more porridge and more porridge oh my goodness it was around about this time the little girl came back from her walk in the park well actually in the forest out she comes and she gets to the end of the grass right near the end of the village and she could smell something ooey gooey sticky and yummy she looked down and sure enough it was porridge then her mum came running up to her with the porridge pot in her hand and said i don 't know how to make the pot quit cooking porridge the little can you remember what she has to say stop little pot stop and the pot stopped cooking porridge now isn 't that a funny story do you know to this very day if you want to go and visit this village you have to take a spoon and you

oh dear you seem to have an apple and some acorns stuck in your spines let me see if i can help and so she pops over and she grabs the apple with both her paws and she pulls and she falls and she pulls but the apple just won 't budge and now to make matters worse she forgot to put down the grapes when she was grabbing the apple and the grapes are stuck in hedgehog 's quills too so now he has an apple and some acorns and some grapes all stuck poor hedgehog and then suddenly there was a big gust of wind and it blew a little scrap of paper whoosh and the paper floated through the air over the apple tree above the nest that hedgehog made and then it has an apple an acorn some grapes and a bit of paper stuck in his quills too poor hedgehog whatever will he do but not to worry because along comes his friend pig oh hello hedgehog pig says you seem to have a lot of stuff stuck in your quills i know what you can do you should roll over and roll about in the dirt hmm thinks hedgehog that sounds like it might work so she curls herself up into a little ball and she rolls around on the ground rolling rolling rolling rolling rolling all about in the dirt but when she pops back over the apple the acorns the grapes and the paper are all still stuck in her quills but to make matters worse she now has a flower stuck in her quills as well oh no poor hedgehog but then along comes hedgehog 's friend platypus hello hedgehog oh dear you seem to have a lot of stuff stuck in your quills i know what can fix that just dive into the pond and swim around the water will wash all those things off in reasonable and she gives it a go so whoosh splash into the pond she dives and she swims and she swims and she swims as fast as her little legs can take her but when she climbs out of the pond she still has an apple a flower some acorns some grapes and a piece of paper stuck in her quills but to make matters worse now she also has a fish stuck in her quills oh dear poor hedgehog hedgehog was distraught i 'll never fit in my perfect little nest now she said but just when she 's about to give up all hope along comes hedgehog 's friend goat let 's see if we can get group to come along matt says goat oh hello hedgehog wow is that a lovely picnic just for me man i 'm so hungry oh oh please help says hedgehog so goat trots over and starts to eat first of all he eats the fish and next he eats the flour then he eats the acorns and then some grapes and then a bit of paper and last of all the oh and when he 's all finished hedgehog says thank you so much and she 's feeling so tired after her big day that she scurries inside her pretty little nest and has a beautiful sleep sweet dreams hedgehog and that 's the end of the story so i hope you enjoyed my storytelling today

    "text": "thanks very much vicky it 's an honor to be here and um i promise to do my best to answer your questions um in terms of building an ecosystem particularly in the cyberspace a lot of what jihan said earlier today reflected my experience it 's that collaboration and it 's that diversity mindset i really believe that you really don 't know what you don 't know and getting the experts in the room and connecting those dots can really spark those innovation conversations joondalup seems to be this amazing hub we have so much talent here and we have really great partners education industry different innovation spaces so if you can bring the people together to have the good conversations that 's when i think you can really unlock the great ideas and solve those problems and then when you know how you 're going to solve a problem that 's when there 's lots of room for startups and we can really foster that ecosystem so i do think that making sure that hopefully somebody like the cyber innovation hub can play that role of facilitation i guess also telling the story cyber isn 't just coding and tech it 's really something that 's going to affect every single business across industry you know anytime you think about data that you 're collecting it needs to be protected and unfortunately it 's something that is going to affect all of us and it 's an increasing risk that needs to be managed to the best of our ability so i think telling the right story and connecting the right people can really be something that the city of joondalup and other actors in this space can play fantastic thank you and i 'd also like to ask what role can joondala play in terms of establishing its position as a global capital of cyber thanks vicky that 's a great question um i think it 's a double-edged sword i think it 's amazing the innovation space that we have here but we don 't want to be known as the capital city of cyber in the way that we could become a target you know how much fun would it be to take down careful in our communications um building those regional international connections you 've spoken to the time zone i love working with canberra and waking up three hours before they do but i think that our connection was so well placed to play those roles with those emerging countries that jihan identified in that map you know we have direct access to those those time zones and those markets so despite the fact that covert has demonstrated that we are all globally connected and sometimes it 's much better to have that sovereign capability in-house i think building those partnerships and thinking how small businesses from jingle lab can scale to international markets i think could be something really interesting to have that international and regional flavor and you know also learn from those in our regions we have a very different and a very diverse space in wa but learning from other people 's experiences can also help us benefit as well and keep that reputation intact fantastic and do you have any events coming up that small business owners in the room can join or come to and that there we have one in bunbury this afternoon so we 're going to be driving down for that and we do have um a number of cyber saturdays events that we do in terms of education pathways on the 27th of september i believe it 's a monday we 're having an open day at ecu looking at career pathways in science and stem so if you 'd like to come along to that we 'll all be there to help talk through some of the opportunities we have with cyber checkme and with the cyber innovation hub fantastic thank you for sharing your insights thank you and rachel a question for you in terms of and congratulations for the roll out as well i know you 're going to share more about that this morning um what are the current capabilities in june globe and how can businesses future-proof their operations in the short particular around lockdown situations and also long-term in terms of growth and diversification thank you good morning everyone it 's such a pleasure to be here nbn 's purpose is to lift the digital capability that nbn needed to really show just how important digital infrastructure is i know at nbn uh 6 000 of us moved out of our offices in 24 hours and many of us uh remain working from home what 's important is to ensure that you have the digital backbone that that you need for your small business um so that you can work from home as well if required or move your business to a digital platform to work wherever that might be so understanding what what needs you have for your small business uh understanding that there are residential grade services and business grade services i think what we know for small business is you 've kind of got to be a bit of everything in terms of the it director the hr person the you name it technology is uh is a big input to that and ensuring that you 've got the platform that will allow you to have cloud-based services or others so i would really recommend to all small businesses to get advice work to work with partners that can enable your digital platform you don 't need to do it all in once it 's about building blocks for digital future and future proofing um your digital future but through collaboration um and innovation but if you don 't have that platform when really the nbn is just a platform to add opportunity and productivity onto but it 's just making sure that you have the most robust foundation digital foundation you can get yeah that 's brilliant i know my business partner lisa and i when we when we scaled our business last year it was because of technology as well and you know we were running sort of zoom sessions for small business owners getting used to zoom at the time and i know now it 's second nature but certainly we saw that there was a trend of people who were maybe a little bit apprehensive about getting online so we were offering complimentary sessions to them as well so did you find that was a big the training side was a stumbling block for people small business owners it was huge so certainly for our business model and the be in the field it 's around informing influencing and educating that move to an online platform required a huge amount of learning we 've all had those teams calls and now i seem to live on a team 's uh call um all of us lifted our digital capability uh certainly i know my grandparent i never thought that they would um be able to use a qr code or even know what a qr code was so again i think it 's taking things incrementally step by step it 's building those digital blocks it 's ensuring that you understand what 's important to you so if it is 24 7 service that you have a business grade service if you could have a residential grade service that 's fine but really understand the nuance and the difference of it so we spent a lot of time in an education space whether it be and we 're very happy to come back and work very closely with the city to provide that education of what is available because nbn 's a wholesaler we work very closely with our tricky stuff it needn 't be and you don 't need to be an expert in technology to get a digital platform that will work for you in the future brilliant thank you and question for you gihan i know that you talked about one of your last slides that the economy job creation education funding smes and talent is really important which would you say is the most fundamental thing in that okay so i reckon they i mean the research says that all six of them are are required so if you don 't have any one of them then you 're probably not going to be an innovation hub unless you 're really lucky so for me i gravitate to more towards the talent side of it but i think the very first one the economy and the infrastructure and it 's really interesting i think rachel you 're possibly underplaying the role that the nbn 's played because it 's it 's not just a platform it 's an absolutely essential platform and i reckon particularly for a city to provide the infrastructure and the platform really interesting that you 're talking about nbn and cyber security cecily they 're both things that we value most when we don 't see them right we value them the most when they 're invisible but we need them there they 're absolutely essential so i reckon the first one um in terms of the the starting point the building block has to be that platform of their infrastructure in the local economy yeah yeah fantastic and i know those who have um teenage children certainly um if the mbn or goes down or if there 's a there 's a problem with the internet we all know what happens there um i 'd just like to ask you silly regarding job opportunities the rise in cyber security and you know can you tell us more about the skills required and the the depth and breadth and because they 're not all potentially tech rules tell us a bit more about that please well it 's not a very well kept secret that i am not a cyber security technical expert um because there are a range of skills lot of social engineering that goes into cyber security and i think one of the things we 're struggling with at the moment is that communications piece so in my team we have some really great simon 's an amazing communicator who can tell that story about why cyber security is important for everybody so i think you know those communications roles psychology that marketing all of those skills are necessary and then those softer skills i guess the collaboration design thinking and unlocking innovation i 'm hoping we 're going to see a lot more cyber security startups meeting the needs and solving those problems of small businesses cyber check me is an example of that and lots of the skills you need for that is a combination of tech skills but then connected with other skills to help you communicate with your stakeholder i do see this as a growth industry and ecu has got an incredible program but also north metro tafe we have pathways for students to study cyber so i think it 's it 's definitely something in terms of skills and re-skilling it 's and get the accreditation so then you can move into the cyberspace whether or not you are a coder and a tech wizard or whether or not you 're excellent at speaking and managing and organizing people and inspiring people yeah fantastic and i 'd like to ask rachel in your opinion what do you think are the top three things required to consider to future-proof june globe i think it it comes from a willingness to have collaboration and innovation at the heart of all your decisions it 's ensuring that you 've got a strong vision strong key initiatives and a purpose as to whether that is for digital innovation or innovation hubs and it 's got to be led from the top i think as gehan has mentioned is having that strong digital platform to enable collaboration and innovation is essential and then also it 's having a willingness to collaborate to have that diversity of thought to not look at just one sector it 's diversify across multiple sectors to invite them into to really um drive that change in innovation and culture within joondalup yeah the top three things that are required to consider to future-proof joondalup well i 'm not biased but it was really interesting for me to see design thinking as one of those core skills i do think it 's an amazing methodology to really unlock people 's creativity you may not feel creative and you may not even understand some of the needs or problems you 're trying to solve so i do think that that 's an amazing process that the city can run as part of your strategic planning a small business can run you can run it at a board meeting level but it 's an amazing methodology that really helps you understand your situation and build a plan for you to be a little bit creative be a bit uncomfortable i think so i would say design thinking i think challenging yourself and being uncomfortable imagining that punch in the face imagining what your competitors are doing i think it 's something that the city of joondalup is you know well positioned to think about and i think the third thing is investing in the city combination of you know the people and the infrastructure so perhaps thinking about innovation spaces we have some really exciting spaces already built and in the pipeline perhaps so i think you know investing in the the people of the future and also the spaces of the future i 'm really delighted you said that because i know lisa and i are master practitioners in entrepreneurial mindset and we certainly we talk about the human capacity and capabilities of innovation and that 's certainly something around design thinking as well so really liked what you said there i 'm curious in terms of how this is a question for you all um you might want to um one of you might want to answer it how can we enable australia 's potential next unicorn here in june globe well or we might have one in the room maybe a couple we might i think my short answer is um making sure we keep a unicorn i mean perth as an entrepreneurial space we 've demonstrated that you know canva came from perth you know now it 's a global company we definitely have the human capability we 've got kind of reverse covert brain gain we have so many people moving home for a safe and healthy space to live so how do we capitalize on that human talent and then make them want to stay when they scale their business and not lose them to either melbourne or sydney when they want to take the next steps so i think it 's we can definitely grow the next unicorn how do we keep it as a based uniform i know we talked about i love both love for paris but i know certainly i was a few people i 've been talking to recently they 've you know moved from sydney and melbourne here because wa is one of the safest places to live right now we know that and yeah fantastic um gihan your your thoughts in terms of australia 's next unicorn here actually i think cecily answered the question better than i could because i was going to give a similar answer to that right but i reckon the one of the keys is just making real focus and i talk to large organizations and they 're so far away from solving their customers problems that there 's all these layers of management and hierarchy i was working with the team yesterday they were doing the team planning day and they were saying we did great stuff here in australia but our parent companies in geneva and they tell us exactly what to do they want to start at 10 o 'clock in the day in europe and so we can only have meetings in the afternoon they 've got all these barriers between themselves and actually solving their customers and clients problems and i think we 've got this huge advantage here if you 're a small or medium business you don 't have the deep pockets of a large business but you also don 't have a lot of the baggage and i think in the future if you want to be agile and nimble and flexible this is about us this is about us taking control and so i don 't need to answer the unicorn question but the more that we can way i think the better off we are and i 'm curious what do you all believe as the city of joondalup 's role in future proofing i think it 's about uh remaining curious i think that 's a huge driver it 's it 's it is having that collaboration it 's around innovation uh but also that diversity of thought and asking the questions as gehan mentioned of what else could you do what else is there and it 's ensuring that you provide that platform of curiosity you 're excited about it the vision is really clear and then you invite that diversity of thought sometimes it 's failing off and failing cheaply but having that mindset that it 's okay to fail because it 's what you 've learned from that i think will set joondalup up for success and being proudly um innovative and excited about the future cecilia what are your thoughts on that i mean i think everything that rachel has said resonates i think it is part of that platform and that that base level um i certainly have only been in is that energy and that is that support so i really think that that 's a great foundation for for future proofing joondalup i think keeping their eye on the the horizon um scenario planning for different possible events we have so much going on at the moment and unfortunately not every event that we 're going to see in the next 10 15 30 years is going to be something positive so thinking about that adaptability and risks that we know are going to possibly impact us we can we can take action on earlier we can be at the forefront of issues so i think yeah keeping the eye on the horizon and having that really great foundation to invite all of the amazing talent that we have to get those innovative ideas happening i think you know that would be an amazing place for the city to be and can i ask i 'm curious what are the current capabilities in wa in the development of robotic and automated technologies but you couldn 't ask deeply on the current capabilities but i know there are things in really bring those different actors together perhaps in the city of dunderlup so i think there 's definitely a lot of movement in that area and i have been seeing even in the only few weeks i 've been in the role a collaboration across industry so you know making sure we don 't get stuck in the silos of mining over here and health over here and you know academia over here if we 're thinking about you know robotics and ai they 're across all of these industries it 's almost like cyber security and as we build robotics that 'll run off little networks we 've got to think about who could also access those networks so i think making sure that we 're we 're not working in silos and that we are really fostering that honest collaboration having those tough conversations and and making sure we see each other as a space to learn because that 's how we can innovate and also build our own resilience if something unfortunate does happen and i like what you said there about honest collaboration and certainly design together and changing mindsets as well so really like that okay well let 's get some questions from the audience in terms of slido so please ask some questions we we have them coming up on the screen apparently um i 'll ask a question while we 're waiting okay um this should be coming up there but um we 'll ask i 'll ask another question so gihan what are your thoughts in terms of um in terms of wa the the eco system and the future proofing and the from sydney and melbourne and the the divide there what are your thoughts in terms of how we can foster more collaboration there but particularly because i mean i know in our business we haven 't been able to fly over east to be able to scale physically so what are your thoughts how can we work around that and yes we can leverage technology but what are the other ways to we can we can deal with that apart from getting on a spaceship to fly with the kardashian kardashians over there what can we do but you it 's it doesn 't have to be apart from leveraging technology it is about leveraging technology and there 's no reason that we can 't have like we 're here today we 're here in person with some people who are just as smart as anybody in the eastern states oh this is not being recorded no we really are going here with super smart people who are entrepreneurial innovative and for us to be among people like this is just amazing and i love that i love that like i 'm a perth boy from way back and i think kind of lived here long enough i 've spent a short time on the gold coast but you know it 's always been my home and it 's fantastic that especially now as we talked about the best time zone in the world we 've got the digital connectivity we 've got that that isolation which not only has kept us safe from covid but also means that we 've been doing we 've been doing things our own way for a long time that we 've got to reach out and we should be doing that but i yeah i don 't think we need to think of ourselves as little as little cousins anymore as we used to we used to look over east and say oh if i knew we could be like the big boys but i think now we 're looking north north in in western australia and north to asia yeah and it 's interesting tomorrow night is the insight awards which is the flagship awards of technology in wa there 's probably some people in the room who are who are going to that as well so it 's really great to see that happening as well i 'm curious is a question from someone is ai threatening human to human emotional interaction i 'm happy to take that one you go for it all right all the research says that machines and people are better together than either of them alone so it 's not an either or question it 's an and question it 's just like i 've written my book and the fact that i used a me a better writer but it helps me get my book out better and uh and all the research says like the the best ai chess software can beat the best human grandmaster but a grandmaster working with aihs software can beat the best ai and so it 's all about humans and people work uh humans and machines working well together that stat that i showed about uh ai counselors and saying most people would rather talk to a robot or work with ai than a human it 's not about one or the other that was the way the question was worded but really the smartest people know that they can use software and ai just like i use google maps to find my way here that 's ai built into into my smartphone and i 'd rather use that than try to just navigate my way or use an old-fashioned street directory so use them both together so it 's really interesting the the human cap the nurturing the emotional intelligence and being able to nurture those soft skills to be able to support the future future-proofing up on the screen yeah okay um so yeah so we talked about the future-proofing joondalup we 've got agility investing training openness to change community community part partnerships supporting talent and that 's great you 're all doing this in different ways that 's fantastic any more questions from the audience someone says here you okay you you talk about support and for that okay the next unicorn what they actually need is accommodation while scaling developers how would you provide them this support that 's a fantastic question who said that and i know we 've got jamie in the room who jamie and i 'm going to do you a quick shout out because we are actually we have an office virtual office at your um cbd address and you 're just launching your um new facilities here in june look very soon so it 's great that you 've got that there and there will be more office space available as well so um anything else that you want to add to that certainly from an ecu 's perspective how you can support and scale and you can actually have that human interaction and that kind of support and that infrastructure that we 've talked about both digital and physical i think it 's the access to expertise it 's opening those doors because if you are a tiny business or a small startup you don 't always know who to go to when you have a question to answer so i think getting access to expertise whether it 's in the innovation space or in cyber security or if it 's finance you know having somebody to play that role of kind of being that connector making sure you can ask the questions to the right people and access the human capital that we have in the city i think is really important um and it would be really interesting to see if we managed to have like a really interesting tech incubator or accelerator we have a few different accelerator programs around the state but we don 't have a permanent space so that could be something interesting for the city of junior lab or for perth in general fantastic but that 's i opening those doors i think could be really good for our startups brilliant you guys should meet definitely there 's collaboration there for sure brilliant well we 've actually ran out of time um for any more panel questions um thank you so much for your insights today it 's been really um insightful and i 'm gonna um can we have a huge round of applause for our panelists thank you thank you okay and i 'm going to um invite the city of june look ceo to stage so if you _"

    "text": "thank you very much vicky can i begin by acknowledging the hard-working councillors of the city of journal up who join us here this morning in councillor kerry hollywood councillor nige jones councillor christopher may councillor tom mclean and councillor philippa taylor to the city of journal up ceo mr james pearson to our local members of parliament first mr ian goodenough federal member for more to the local member for kingsley ms jessica strzoikovsky mla to the member for journalist emily hamilton mla to our keynote speaker mr gehan pereira and to all of you who join us here this evening as local business stakeholders in the city of joonla on behalf of the city journal up thank you for joining us for the second of our business forums for 2021 this morning we 're lucky to be hearing from one of australia 's leading futurists gehan pereira an accomplished online presenter conference speaker and author gehan has one simple goal this morning and that is to help you get your business fit for the future he 's the author of several books including the future of leadership disruption the number five social media influencer in the world and the first in australia in his area of expertise following gehan 's presentation he will also be taking part in an interactive panel discussing how our community and our economy can thrive through disruption and be fit for the future joining him will be the recently appointed director of wa oz cyber innovation hub sicily cecily rawlinson and rachel mcintyre the general manager of state corporate affairs at nbn co this is an interactive session and i encourage you to submit the question via slido for consideration to the panel please please do submit a question because today is all about helping you prepare for a future that is probably going to be increasingly disrupted so use this opportunity looking to the future has been a key focus for the city of joondalup particularly as our work continues on our new 10-year strategic community plan this morning 's forum is an essential part of shaping that high-level strategic document which guides the city and its operations over the next decade indeed in reflecting on our previous strategic community plan this puts out and then carries on doing what we 're doing that very much guides us over our 10 yearly cycles and if you reflect on our previous document we 've achieved the majority of the goals within that this very much sets our path because the next leg of our journey is going to be exciting city adrenalup is transitioning from an economy supported by population growth to one which is driven by private and public sector investment innovation and entrepreneurship which is why our business breakfasts are so important the journal up of 2031 or 2032 will no doubt look a lot different to the doodle up today at our may business forum we heard from demographer bernard salt who is confident that journal up was in a good position to meet the challenges ahead particularly those posed by the covet 19 pandemic for those of you who read the australian you might have seen he came out with an article just yesterday continuing the theme that he shared with us back in may and we got a great shout out indeed for one of our own local when he was here a few months ago one thing that bernard spoke about in particular was the shift to hybrid working for staff of both small businesses and larger corporates in meeting this need i 'm pleased to share that liberty western australia 's largest local and independently owned flexible workspace provider is soon to open its sixth location in wa right in the heart of the judo lab city centre opening later this year this 776 square metre facility will provide 122 workspaces in 34 private offices a co-working space a lounge area and two state-of-the-art boardrooms and it 's good to invite it 's good to have them here today as well throughout these uncertain times our city has maintained a very simple message joondalup is open for business our goal is to build joonalup 's reputation as a place for innovation and creativity by enhancing growth across a range of sectors we want to be a home for progressive businesses that bring to the table fresh ideas and create diverse employment opportunities and build on the global connectivity of our community to assist in achieving this approvals program which is led by the sbdc or the small business development corporation this aims to streamline the processes of obtaining business licenses and trading permits from local government authorities and to improve the overall experience of business customers in the city of joonla this is part of a package of initiatives which is designed to accelerate regulatory reform to support economic recovery following the covet 19 pandemic i 'm also pleased to announce that this morning our city is the first local government in wa to become a campaign partner of the australian made campaign and you 'll see their table outside due to the impact of covert 19 there 's been a significant upswing in demand for australian made products we know that while some of joondalup 's businesses are leveraging this opportunity for domestic sales and expats it 's an exciting opportunity for more local businesses to get on board the iconic golden green kangaroo triangle australia 's most recognized and trusted country of origin brand i 'll pay particular recognition to the ceo who 's led this initiative again the very first local government in political support and strong community buy-in around the country a few weeks ago the city of journal up also hosted our second innovation challenge an entrepreneurship event featuring students from right across western australia co-created by the city and the frank team this challenge was sponsored by study perth lottery west edith county university north metro tafe uwa curtin university south metro tafe the australian institute of workplace training and the national institute of technology with support from joondalup business association and space cubed this highly successful initiative is yet another example of positive collaboration between joondalup as a local government and important local stakeholders i 'm pleased to see that our competition runners-up are here today the eva team eva who came up with a fantastic idea to create an augmented reality app to gamify learning experiences for students and encourage soft skill development it was a sensational pitch and it 's good to have your team here today with us we also have many of the mentors and the keynote speakers from the challenge here today and i 'd like to thank all of them for supporting that of the future as the first innovation hub in western australia joondalup as australia 's cyber capital has the potential to be the epicenter for homegrown and global talent in both startups and scale scale-ups the city also works to support initiatives in this area through programs such as cyber check me who are joining us here today as well an enactus led by ecu as well as the jobs and skills centre in north metro tafe contributing to the development of future innovators entrepreneurs and workers we 're also keen to be a strong advocate for integrated work integrated learning and provide many opportunities for students in our city to get real-life work experience to this end we currently have four cyber security students from north metro tafe undertaking a placement at the city and working on a range of

    "text": "[Music] hi everybody I 'm probability and welcome to my very first episode of Bellini 's TV I 'm so excited that you could join me today it 's a short sharp episode but I hope you 're ready to get started so before you waste any more time I 'm gonna get you to stand up and we 're gonna have a little bit of a warm-up are you ready okay all you have to do is make sure there 's a little bit of space around you and copy what I do warming up is a great way to stay focused and start the day to get rid of or whatever you need to do so circling your hands that 's it and your elbows back the other way and I want you to bring your arms up and do a gentle twist just face it just like that keep your knees nice and soft take one arm across wiggle your fingers pointing your thumbs down excellent other arm across wiggle your fingers put your thumb down taking one arm behind your head pulling your elbow down nice arm behind your head looking forward that 's it stretching you down okay shaking out your arms we 're gonna take action to our chest and up taking out ear down to our shoulder back to the center ear down to our shoulder and back to the center looking over your left shoulder mm-hmm back to the center looking over your right shoulder and back to the center okay now that we 're a little bit warmed up and ready to start she 'd shake it out shake it out so you go all loosey-goosey rolling your neck turn to making sure that when you want your nice and gentle with your body we 're just trying to get it ready to rub now I thought I was hot stop today 's episode with a little bit of a hand brain things up that 's right I can 't even say it that 's how tricky it is gonna be so just to get started we 're gonna push your hands together just warming up your hands squeeze them in and out are your hands are so ready okay and our hand together just like this pushing our fingers apart and just with our index finger and we 're gonna make a loop can you see that okay we 're gonna swap those loops over like this can you do it so one at a time it 's a tricky one all right let 's try it one more time so hands together put them facing down we 're gonna scratch out our fingers a little bit I 'm gonna make two loops with our thumb and forefinger left and right and then we 're gonna swap them over a little bit tricky all right shaking them out try something a little bit simpler we 're gonna rotate our hands three bring them up to our buddy open out like a butterfly and grab them again all right hanging out open out like a butterfly okay over now rotate like a butterfly shaking them out now if you got that great job because they 're not easy exercises especially for little fingers it 's going to just gently shake now I 've got one more thing to do once you gently roll our hips around stretching out our back and hips see it back the other way now that we 're ready to start I 'm going to show you one of my favorite things in the whole world I literally travel the whole globe to find this thing then learned how to use it so I can 't wait for you to share it 's a little bit of a magic trick you ready tada that 's right it 's a hollow who poops has been found all around the world in history but centuries and perhaps even millennia that first found images of hula-hoops being roll on the ground with sticks in ancient Greek times and they are terrific and throughout our culture here in Australia now hands up who can holla hoop can you hold a hoop I know some people have a little bit of trouble so today I thought I might give you a little bit of a crash course on how to follow and if we have time a couple of extra tricks that you can play with at home would you like to don 't worry you can still practice along because there 's lots of fundamentals that you can practice without doing the whole thing all right now it 's really really important there are two ways that you can hula hoop number one and I see a lot of people doing this you can go the crazyfish method now the Krazy fish method looks a little bit like this I know it 's a little bit ridiculous or you can do what we call the tummy tuck method so to do this one all you need to do is take your finger point it up to the sky and stick it in your belly button no I 'm being serious take your finger point it up to the sky and stick it in your belly button yeah okay now the reason I 've got you to do that is because I want you to imagine that there 's a little coin this big sitting on your belly button side on just like this can you see it all right now a week the whole loop we 're going to be drawing use this method and call it in isolation so it looks a little bit like this can you see I 'm pushing with my tummy in and out drawing the circle did you get it great too easy hmm now once you get the idea with going around the middle of that circle you can move that circle anywhere all up and down your body and this is where we call it being in isolation so that can be moved all the way up the column of your whole body and it might look a little bit like this so I 'm gonna move that circle up to my chest and then up to my neck are you ready okay you say pushing on the loop we 're gonna push it up from that circle sit and all the way up all the way up to my neck see where the circles now I 'm still using a little bit of my other body to help push it around but that that 's where you can start getting the energy of day just remember finger bellybutton Circle pushing that circle pretending to hold in your bellybutton okay a couple of other things that are gonna make your hula hooping lots easier start with your feet hip width apart same width as your hip and keep your knees and legs nice and soft but still straight when you have your whole hoop you 're gonna put it up around your waist that 's it and you 're gonna hold your palms OH we 're making a circle just like that gonna hold it at your back and you 're gonna give it a big push wind up just like this I 'm gonna I 'm Haller hooping to my left you may pull the hoop the opposite way so remember to switch it up or just do what feels good with your bulleting okay so big push and circle pushing your tummy try and draw that circle I 'm gonna turn around in a circle so you can see my back and that 's all you need to do start off with aiming for ten seconds and see if you can get all the way up to a minute all of you don 't have a whole hoop you don 't need to spend lots of money to get one I 'm gonna put in the show notes quickly how to make your own hula hoop and if that 's not your style where you can get good quality hoops around Western Australia to support local businesses now last thing a good-sized hole who comes up just above your hip it can be bigger and the remember the heavier the hula hoop that tends to be the easier it is but if it 's small and light it 's gonna be quite tricky so hope you have a wonderful day I 've been palpable lunar you 've seen your first balloon ease TV show episode I 've got lots of things coming up and I can 't wait for you to join us so stay tuned for our next episode or five-minute activity and see you out there thanks everyone bye bye [Music] you _"

    "text": "so thank you i 'll start with you bernard and uh just touching on where you left off really i guess uh looking at your slides we are a fully self-contained mini me cbd you 've described us as and going through that checklist it seems that joondalup really ticks 10 out of 10. uh yes well in fact um you know i was delighted to have received the uh the invitation to speak at joondalup because i kind of knew it was going to be a good story it 's often hard to turn up to a place where it 's more challenging i mean the demographics are challenging different parts of australia this is a positive story this is a positive story that needs to be told and understood uh and a vision articulated to the local community i 'm sure it 's there uh but um uh that to me is where where this community can go when you look at the focus that the business community has on skills and training i speak a lot around australian dealing with people all the time and media and extraordinary the first question every board every business person every community group wants answered is around how do we get skills because the usual supply line the hydraulic hose delivering those skills has been kinked so we 're going to have to up the ante in terms of our ability to pump out and skill up the local population is the is the point i think that 's certainly an opportunity for the education and skilling hub that you have here in uh in joondalup so we 'll get back to education in a minute and i 'm keen to hear michelle 's thoughts on this but also interested about the timing of the messaging so you made a few points there that let 's not wait 10 years and it 's not forward 20 years let 's do it immediately what how well how do we time the message of this out to the broader community not just locally but nationally and internationally i suspect well look i i i get the need for long-term strategic planning and you know perth and other other metropolitan areas have all that purposes but i think that the average business person and that 's the community that i deal with when i talk in boardrooms i learn very very early on uh board members are not polite if you 're telling them what 's going to happen in 2050 they will let you know straight away they are interested in the influenceable future they 'll use that term the influenceable future for them is the next five years it 's why um my my sky television program from a few years ago it 's called the next five years it is the touch point and you are dealing with people that are putting their careers their lives their capital on the line what is your prediction what is your expectation for 2025 2026 that to me is where we need to be focused and that is what i think the business community will respond to so given that we 're living in this post-pandemic world and we 're still living through snap lockdowns snap restrictions that literally change overnight how do we actually deal with that immediacy especially for businesses in the actually future-proofing well the good thing about demography is i can identify the problems i can 't always identify the solutions and i 'm looking for michelle to uh to actually uh help with that to say well look here is what we can do if there is a ramp up demand for this kind of skill set um you know the technical aspects of mining or technical aspects of engineering whatever uh here is what we can do we can amp up short courses we can retrain people from this skill set into that skill set it 's that ability to be agile to read the market and say well yes this is the kind of skill set we need to be specializing in literally over the next five years or so when i 'm in melbourne the issue there is around getting um getting technical people to assist with the metro tunnel project now that 's a 12 billion dollar 12 kilometer tunneling project which is largely being supported in terms of skilled labour out of the homes glenn tafe now that 's the kind of thing that to be focusing on that to deliver the kind of skills the kind of quantities we need to deliver that vision now i don 't know what the equivalent projects are here mining projects i understand so which institutions deliver those skills what can we do minister in order to make that happen otherwise going to be a choke point and we want to free up the economy we want to create the best opportunity environment so that the people of our community and of perth and western australia can prosper over that next five-year period so michelle this is a perfect segue into your area of expertise from the last 12 months what are the key skills that you hear from industry are being required and reflected in the vet training sector yeah well bernie 's got an honorary job in my marketing too you know um absolutely the the reflection on all the data that ben has been actually presenting to us today totally reflects what our findings have been and what we 've had to do as a training sector to really respond to the needs so general of training uh terry durant managing director of south metro tafe and me to actually undertake a really rapid review speaking to so many people across every different industry to actually identify what were the industries that were totally disrupted um were worried about the job keeper cliff at the time whose jobs were people not going to be able to go back to what were the industries that were needing to grow and continue where the skill shortages were as bernard said what was going to be the impact of loss of migration that kink coming off and how are we just rapidly responding to ensuring that there was kind of job security and business continuity and growth um and all of the things that came out were exactly some of the things that you 've been raising and then it was obviously um you know transport and logistics and even if you look at our mining sector it 's not just a mining sector it 's really a transport logistics sector it 's all about rail and heavy haulage you know um truck drivers i 'm pretty least 100 new truck drivers during that period um we 've got um you know uh healthcare and uh social assistance was um absolutely big one food and accommodation a lot of chefs um actually my uh were part of that migration of skills so we 've sort of gone through a stage of not really um having as many apprenticeships in in western australia is what we need and so the importance of actually growing local and and changing that was a big issue um as as well as absolutely all of the technical skills the cyber security um and all of those things were really um priorities and so we just rapidly had to transition about um how did we actually make sure that we had skill sets so this was really joined up government we had fee-free skill sets that we were able to put on in short notice in these high demand and growth areas we also were looking to work with other government and the government stimulus so things like infrastructure development you said homes glenn we 're looking at metronet we have the same transport we put on free infrastructure skill sets we 've had we had travel agents and other people who 'd been in that industry but then moved into infrastructure and then they got jobs straight on the metronet projects so we did all that kind of work although i now realize that there 's one skill set that we were missing and just for all you men in the room we 're going to look into the pillow arranging a lost cause i think in hot demand now michelle tafe seems to be enjoying its moment in the sun at the moment perhaps languaging in the past decade a little bit in terms of where business saw it sit in the skill set how has the the debit changed the way that training 's actually being delivered yeah i i think absolutely um it 's a brilliant time um we 've been working you know so closely with other government agencies you know the support of our minister there 's investment in training we 're about to build a new 17 million dollar um has been announced recently the automotive 've got two campuses here in joondalup we 've got our kendra campus which is all about you know technology and business and horticulture so the ag was a big one as well of course you know what 's happening there um and as well we 've got our mclarty campus which is really all about health and social assistance so you know we 're kind of exactly hitting the marks i think and both of those have had investments over over the years so i think that it is really fantastic to be in tafe because businesses are ringing us and asking us about the skilled workers you know like our students are all getting jobs before they finish you know people are changing their careers they 're adding value to their careers so it is kind of a brilliant time and in terms of you know um what we what we 're developing on our campuses our automotive facility it 's not same old same old because um one of the things that 's happening of course is that we 're aware you know that whole industry is be coming in and we 've got the way that those buildings are built now it 's all about diagnostics and data and fault finding it 's about technology and part of that review is about 21st century training and apprenticeships and it 's about how these different disciplines are now converging in intelligent ways and even with the hort area that we 've got on at the moment you know what what we found in talking to d-pad recently that a lot of small and medium-sized um businesses that are wanting to supply the coals the igas the costcos they 're really needing that industry 4.0 that transformation that connectivity and so we 're building into a horticulture area that notion of you know what are those smart systems that need to be in place for people who are going to become producers or manufacturers and we 're tying that into our automotive center as well because you 've got many warehousing and logistics things so who would have thought that once upon a time that when we built our whole environment and when we built our automotive environment know because industry is transforming and businesses to pivot and survive you know now know that they need to have all of these fundamental systems in place to be able to maintain the people to whom they supply absolutely so it 's not just about training but it 's also about upskilling and reskilling the existing workforce so james if i can throw over to you perhaps and see you know with the closure of borders and that heightened dependence on our internal workforce and our local workforce what sort of role do you see the city playing as far as becoming a real training center for this region well we 've got thanks pierre we 've got a few interns in the audience today and it 's it 's great to see them here and that 's part of what we 're doing in terms of engaging with the local education institutions we 're also looking at ways in which we can attract not just dollar capital but also human capital talent into the city as well as finding opportunities to work with the people in our learning precinct that are here in joondalup at the moment and bernard 's already talked about the fact that life in joondalup in the future is going to begin at 43 and so we 're going to need to be thinking about what will they bring and what will they need as they move into the city as well so as well as managing through the pandemic it 's also about looking into the future one of the great things about the uh the city of joondalup i don 't know if any of you have had the pleasure of visiting our administrative building it sits right next to a park which sits right next to a tafe which sits right next to edith cowen university and if you take a short walk in the other direction before too long you 're in the grounds of what shortly to become the largest hospital in the state what more could you ask for it 's all physically co-located and notwithstanding the fact that we 're gradually realizing that we 're moving into the new world of zoom or in the case of our actually being in the same room with other people particularly if it only takes you five minutes to walk to see them is still going to be really important and that 's exactly how we 've been designed and built to be in joondalup you tell us stay with you for a minute you touched on an interesting point there at skills and obviously with skill comes the idea of innovation and change we 're seeing a real wave of new business models being adopted now this new innovation is wonderful but it sometimes butts up against the more traditional procurement methodologies and frameworks that we 're finding how what role does local government in this instance the city of joondalup specifically play in de-risking procurement and enabling businesses to really have a safe environment to test that innovation well local government i 'll admit um doesn 't have the finest of reputations in some minds as being a hotbed of innovation but that can 't_''_799.839 be an accusation made of the city of joondalup we for example have been actively piloting a number of new ideas from local businesses through a digital innovation fund and one of the beneficiaries of that engaging education is is in the stalls outside and if you hadn 't had a chance beforehand please go out and introduce yourself to them after after this session we 've also looked at partnering with other local governments as well as ecu and others to fund cyber check me which is all about helping small businesses home businesses and others who are venturing into the digital space or hadn 't realized they are exposed in the digital space to actually acquire an understanding in the tools they need to operate effectively and securely in that environment and one of the most important interactions between local government and business is in the whole approval system that whole red tape system and we 've recently signed a a partnership with the small business development commission here in western australia to run the ruler over the approvals process the planning processes and so on we have in local government here in joondalup and identify where we can make them better how we can streamline them and the point here is because it 's vital that community retains confidence in the compliance requirements the regulations that business operates under but at the same time most of us would recognize that there 's plenty of room for improvement in the way that local government goes about those regulatory and approval processes that can make it easier quicker and cheaper for businesses for local businesses and businesses that come in from outside to set up and get running in joondalup so that 's i guess a snapshot of the kinds of things we 're looking to do to make it better easier for businesses both local and those we once will come from other parts of the state the nation and overseas and become local in the next few years to set up and do business and grow in joondalup okay so i 'll remind everyone please put through your questions on slido they 're coming through here and we 're picking the most high profile ones i 'm going to pick the one sitting at the top at the moment which is what can be done to further position joondalup as a i 'll probably throw that to you james in a minute can i just have your take on joondalup is not unique across australia i suspect you know we 'd like to think so we 'd like to think we 're special but how do you see this conversation that question in particular play out it 's a question that would be asked in melbourne in brisbane in wherever it 's a very common question and um the the thing that i think you can do is it 's not one thing it 's a whole suite of things it 's a state of mind if you like you need to offer in my view if you want the very best talent that could literally choose to live anywhere in australia or in fact the world then you need to have a living environment that is um that is equal to the best that uh silicon valley has to offer that are equal to the best that sydney 's north shore or melbourne 's eastern suburbs have to offer in fact so quality of life you know the cafe environment uh i i think you need a range of housing you need all of the lifestyle accoutrement not just arts and education and so forth but also training and medical and health facilities you need access to an international airport it 's that checklist it might seem fairly basic but in actual fact that is what you need to deliver to say well and then you need to be on the list you need to be have mind presence with those people who would have heard of a small town in western victoria of 5 000 people were it not for the stall gift here is an event that projects that little town across australia for a weekend when jeff kennett was the premier of victoria in 1993 the first thing he did one of the first things he did was to change the name of the tennis center from flinders park named after an early explorer he changed it to melbourne park because canada understood that at the baseline photograph of video television that goes around the world brand melbourne so not only do you need all the bits deliver in terms of infrastructure quality of life housing whatever you need to be on the list mind space and reputation and reputation projection is part of that story going forward give a good story to tell it needs to be well told james do you care to comment on that from a city of joondalup 's perspective tourism up what is that special source that we 're offering up here well i think bernard 's nailed it in terms of the importance of promotion joondalup already has everything pretty much that we need to build on uh we can we can add to that we can improve on that there 's no doubt but the fundamentals as we 've already talked about today are already there um earlier this week um nasheed who is the terrific head of our economic development area we were sitting down with colleagues looking at a video that we 're putting together in collaboration with the state government to promote investment in joondalup and the first cut of the video was good but it wasn 't great and what it needed to do is of not people in the city building and buyers place not people in the state government who are helping to fund it but people in other parts of the country in other parts of the world who we want to make that threshold decision of by themselves or with their board colleagues to put their money and risk their capital and their future in joondalup rather than somewhere else and so we really as we talk through what was in this video and what we needed to be in this video we came to the realization that while the the images and the things that was talking about could pretty much stay the same it was the potential that we needed to sell it was the ideas of what could be done in this great city of joondalup that we needed to communicate and that i think is the big step that local governments who are looking to do the right thing by their communities and try and attract the investment and and create the wealth that will build future amenity and prosperity we need to put ourselves in the what i see is that we 've got the assets both in terms of the the built environment the national environment is drop dead gorgeous have a look out the picture window as an example there 's more ideas more things happening in joondalup all the time we need to project that to the world in a way that the world will understand and say to itself i want some of that okay so let 's get back in down into the bit of the micro and to the businesses in the room i guess and i 'm going to refer to what i call your fried egg slide that 's what it reminds me of when we talk about that 20-minute commute to to work now you talk about working from home as well as well as working near home do you think that 's something that 's going to subside or do we have a short-term memory and we 're going to go back to business as usual or is it here to stay no this is here to stay and the reason is that it links into experienced work from home will say well actually you know i don 't need the second car i don 't need three suits i need one really good suit i don 't have a dry cleaning bill it offers me a better quality of life i think what will happen is that the nature of work will shift so you do hard sort of concentration type work might be an audit analysis or a law opinion for example or a consulting report or a column or an article that i might write something like that but in the workplace it 's a place of collaboration of deal doing of training so it 's a the functionality of work will change and some people will not be able to work from home full-time because now they 're young if you 're 38 to 42 you 've got you 've got young kids that it 's kind of cute when they interrupt the first time a zoom call but you know if you 're if you 're if you 're selling a big deal you don 't want that interrupted so you be able to work uh near home so you would have your home office and you 'd want a collaboration space nearby in like um joondalup or if you 're on the north shore of sydney so the northern beaches uh you do you really need to go into the city or can there be a near work near home hub for the bank one of the major banks in manly that that is my point you want that sort of not only are we going to facilitate work from home but we 're going to work facilitate work near home because we think there are 38 to 43 year olds they 'll be attracted to this place who will have kids we 've actually thought it through we 've got the narrative actually thought through and we 've got the perfect offer for you i 'm certainly seeing that um i mean i love that slide the transition from fried egg to like scrambled eggs it looked like um so i 'm certainly saying that like in my own workforce but also in my student population absolutely you know or not work from home it 's now the blended you know it 's blended learning for us a mix of online and classroom or workshop environment type learning very hands-on but engagement in a whole way of areas when we used to conceive of online learning it was in a very non-sophisticated sort of linear way we would put you know kind of like uh lectures or pages online but it 's not that now now it 's online like this it 's it 's it 's zoom it 's um teams meetings it 's lecturer-led um learning that is um responsive to the rest of the participants but absolutely it 's that mix of people being at home sometimes at work sometimes engaging with us in either place and then within our campuses sometimes you know and my own workforce is the same can i just add to that or build on that um i i did not know what a zoom call was 15 months ago um and uh initially no i do presentations like this uh online uh you can book me if you wish but the point the point is that that i did not know what it was and the entire industry the entire speaking industry just did not know what to do and by september the very first primitive zoom call presentations were starting to evolve what i 've noticed from september of last year literally to today and going forward every week the standard has increased not you need the proper light you need the proper camera you need a proper microphone you need a proper plant behind you for the background whatever and the skill sets that are evolving are almost like the production facilities of a tv studio yeah in fact i was at australia post yesterday this in this this could be the today show set it was in the corporate world and the reason is that when you are dealing with clients or students or employees or people you want to sell to the bar is continually rising and you need to respond to that with agility you need to lean into it learn the technology and learn the language of the post-covert world to me it 's the um the way in which the world is changing yeah our student satisfaction is looking great and uh participation has gone up so it 's here to stay that blended yeah definitely here to stay in the training environment yeah so james i guess you know not everyone can have necessarily a zoom room at home we 've got the rise of the co-working spaces which is very hipster and trendy but what about the library those more traditional places of where communities been able to come together have you seen that space change in the last 14 months or the way it 's used by the community well libraries the libraries that the city runs and there are four of them throughout the uh throughout the suburbs have enjoyed covid in the sense that they 've been really important places for people to come more and more you see students who are going there to uh to study you 're seeing other people coming there to use the wi-fi facility to use the resource to use the quiet space um where whatever reason they can 't do it to be a conducive working environment and you you 're listening to someone who was actually expelled from his home because his voice is too loud on the on the telephone and on the zoom and so yes those community facilities have become even more important now of course the challenge has been in this time of covid to make sure that we 're able to provide a coveted safe environment so people can socially distance and be confident that their health will be protected while they 're in that and i think that that 's just a fact of life for the foreseeable future and we 're we 're well geared towards that what else is exciting is that we 're now receiving expressions of very serious interests from investors who want to set up collaborative co-working office spaces in the cbd in the city of joondalup precisely for the reason that bernard you 've outlined they know that there is a significant market of people who live in our suburbs who don 't want to necessarily do all of their work from their home but don 't want 'd love to come into the cbd at joondalup work for a few hours do some co-creation in a collaborative workspace of modern design enjoy the amenity and the attractions of the cbd and then it 's just a 10-minute bike ride or drive home or hopefully cat bus ride home and so we 're already seeing uh in in practice the kind of trends that bernard is describing it 's already happening right here in joondalup it couldn 't be more exciting junedup actually was the first site for a co-working facility outside of the cbd actually we had it on our um kendra campus a collaboration with the city of joondalup um so we 're just a little bit ahead of our time it 's great stuff june certainly has its time in the sun at the moment now i 'm mindful of time and there 's so many questions that we could be asking but i will just touch on each one of you as a wrap up question especially from a business perspective i mean we have to be nimble necessity is the mother invention but you don 't necessarily have large corporate structures around you to support you so from each one of you what would your key take away be for the businesses in the room today the one thing that you would say this is something you need to bear in mind this is something you can do right now in order to set yourself up for success over the next 10 years michelle maybe i could start with you please yeah i think absolutely that supply of skills i think the understanding now that you know there 's speed to market we now have flexibility around skill sets that are just in time that enable you to pivot your business i know pivot 's the overused term but um you know to upgrade your skill set to just shift into uh current technology you know i think that one of our most popular skill sets was really because we realized that businesses that didn 't really already have their foot in the door of that lost ground during covert whereas businesses that had their foot in the gr and the door would kind of like understanding about today 's platforms and and how consumers work um is really critically important james and cyber security sorry i should say got to mention cyber security absolutely got to mention it well look i never i never thought i 'd be on a stage saying this particularly not in my previous incarnation but seriously for local businesses particularly for small businesses local government is your friend people there there has never been there has there has and that does illustrate bernard 's point that the road to salvation does lie in general there have there has never been a better time to be in business that may not seem to make sense but governments at every level are falling over themselves to support business and make available support programs funded by the cheapest money that any of us are ever going to see in our in our lives in fact if anything i think the risk is that businesses particularly small businesses uh would struggle to know where to start looking and you can do a lot worse than pick up the phone or send here it 's a city of joondalup or maybe our friends over in the city of of wanaroo they have business support lines that if they can 't help you directly they will tell you in the nicest way where to go because there are so many there are so many assistance programs out there but what they can do is help you work out which one is probably the one that 's right for you uh there is a smorgasbord of opportunity for business and it 's not all about um lifting businesses up it 's about giving them the hand when they need it most maybe it 's just a particular piece of technical advice maybe it 's a little bit of reassurance maybe it 's something like cyber check me which will help them gain more confidence about taking further steps into the digital world because that 's a world which we already inhabit and we better get used to it can i just add one more i should have said as well we 've got our fantastic jobs and skills centre and i see i 've the booth but i always say i don 't have 900 lecturers i have 900 recruiters so in terms of skills needs for business growth and development in terms of getting jobs and jobs advice our jobs and skills centres um are available to you we have one here in joondalup so it 's definitely there you just need to know where to go and i can 't wait to see that sign on the freeway you 're on the road to salvation i think that would be a great marketing tool so last word over to you vernon please well i think that in times of great change like this uh the thing that um i would say is a must do from this moment forward uh you may well have been doing it anyway uh is lean into this do not resist it there is a better version of australia better version of your business lying on the other side don 't think oh woe is me why did this have to happen how do i get through it when we get back to normal it 's like way of doing business i had a story um over the last week of um a cafe owner that was really hit hard by the closures uh in melbourne uh and he had to shift to selling coffee take away coffee and he said you know actually i 've done more business because i don 't have the operating costs they don 't have the staffing but i can sell this at 4.50 a cup so they 're actually doing better i 'm going to need some water we 're just going to talk amongst ourselves so um there goes my voice so my argument is that you actually need to lean into it it 's what i learned about learning zoom it 's not being resentful about the situation what do i need to do what do i need to learn let 's just get on with it and move forward the greatest strength

change are rising forces which are reshaping the way that we live how we work and even how we form relationships as a speaker the age newspaper has described him as part stand up comedian and part number crunching economist it 's certainly great timing to hear from bernard given the city is developing its own 10-year strategic community plan at the moment this morning 's forum is an essential part of shaping that highest level of strategic document which we have as a city and which will guide the city in its operations over the next 10 years following on from what has been an exciting initial strategic community plan over our past decade i can assure you there is much more to bernard than the fact that he has single-handedly popularized the phrase smashed avocado which we are having this morning hopefully as a as a special treat before you are indeed in for a treat this morning bernard will also take part in an interactive panel on how joondalup can capitalize on its existing assets to take advantage of the trajectory shift in economic activity which is being caused by the covert 19 pandemic joining bernard on the panel will be the city of joonlap 's chief

'd like to say thank you to each and every one of you for your persistence and resilience which you 've displayed over the past 12 months during the covet 19 challenge and even up to and including the recent three-day lockdown and restrictions there 's no doubt that many businesses have been doing it tough particularly in the small business community throughout these uncertain times our city has maintained a very simple message joondalup is open for business our city economy which was supported by population growth to one which is now driven by business investment by innovation and by entrepreneurship we are very fortunate to be home to world-class education institutions such as edith cowen university north metropolitan tafe neca college of electrical training and the wa police academy and we are a city which has been built from our earliest days on knowledge and our goal is to build joondalup 's reputation as a place for innovation and creativity by enhancing growth across a diverse range of sectors we want to be home for progressive businesses that bring to the table fresh ideas and create diverse employment opportunities and leverage the global connectivity of a population which has largely been built on migration joondalup in 2031 or 2032 will no doubt look a lot different to the journal up of today by that time one of our most transformational projects ever undertaken within our boundaries will be completed i 'm talking of course and those of you who 've heard me before i always find a way to mention it about the ocean reef marina project constructions of recently had the pleasure of joining the two local councillors and councillor jones and councillor taylor on a tour of this site the first breakwater rocks i have been lowered into place marking a significant milestone of what will become a world-class coastal destination construction of these breakwaters will take about 18 months using close to a million tons of locally sourced granite and limestone ultimately the construction of the marina will create around eight and a half thousand construction jobs and this project is a wonderful example of the state and local governments working together with the community to achieve an amazing outcome for perth 's growing northern corridor the city is committed to continuing to work collaboratively with development wa and the state government to ensure that the marina is developed under the long-held vision of our city and our community we 're also working towards the development of a coastal node at burns beach to activate that precinct for local and international visitors add to this the joondalup health campus which will very soon be western australia 's largest hospital we 've also proudly welcomed the australian very well positioned to attract talent research and investment both locally and globally particularly within the healthcare sectors it wouldn 't be a journal like business breakfast if i didn 't also touch on cyber security as the first innovation hub in wa australia 's cyber capital joondalup has the potential to become the epicenter for homegrown and global talent startups and scale ups the city supports initiatives such as cyber check me enactus led by ecu and the jobs and skills centre in north metropolitan tafe contributing to the development of our future innovators entrepreneurs and workers the city is also a key partner in wa os cyber node based at the joondalup innovation hub at ecu and the collaboration between ecu wa os cyber and the city of journal up was recently formalised via nmou this agreement commits these organizations to working together to grow and sustain our cyber supply chain in our region it 's no secret that i 'm a pro resources industry individual but i 'm also very pro diversification for the city of journal up and the cyber sector is projected to overtake the conducted by wa oz cyber tells us that for every dollar invested in cyber resilience measures a minimum of 5.50 is returned to the broader local economy in closing diverse economic development is a key priority for the city and it will continue to be so for the next decade through the city 's economic development team we will be focusing on delivering programs to help promote connect and grow local businesses and also attract visitors students talent businesses and investors into the city of joondalup some of the ways which we are doing this is through our business catalogue through our business engagement program and our business ready program and if you have any interest in any of those please go and see our team at the stalls straight after this session i hope that you enjoyed today 's presentation and discussions on shaping our future economy again say please participate via

    "text": "[Applause] thanks uh very much uh p for that uh introduction and thank you also to uh the city of joondalup for the uh invitation to say bernie salt i 'm the managing director of the demographics group these days my presentation today uh deals with um the city of joondalup in the post-covert era what is uh australia what is western australia what is the city of joondalup going to look like over the next five years in particular five or ten years or so and i want to start by taking a really big picture question and asking a fundamental question that i think anyone in business certainly in government would be asking or should be asking of themselves before you look at you know what kind of businesses what do i need to do how do i connect with the next generation there is a single question that everyone should ask themselves and i 'm going to answer it in my first slide is australia a good place to invest your youth your energy your career your life for the next 10 years do you have faith west in the future of the northern part of perth and i say unequivocally yes i 'm going to convince you of that in my presentation today here is a list of numbers figures produced by the international monetary fund it was published two weeks ago and it is important for one reason it shows the economic output of the 15 largest economies on earth today last year in 2020 compared with the previous year some countries have performed better in the pandemic than others your eye will go immediately to number 13 bottom left bottom right bottom left and you 'll see that australia is ranked 13th we are the 13th largest economy on the planet we are barely 25 million people and yet we are the 13th largest economic force on the planet 1 359 billion dollars u.s in gdp it 's about 2 000 billion australian gdp and that number is down two percent in calendar 2020 compared to 2019 prior to the pandemic pandemic effect if you like there 's only one country in this top 15 that has had an increase in gdp over that to be ranked 14th in 2019 we have overtaken spain spain has had a ban pandemic relative to australia that is not my point my point here is that there is no country ranked above australia on this list that has a smaller population we are really rich per capita and we spend our wealth on lifestyle on housing and infrastructure and a key exemplar of that on the australian continent would be the city of joondalup you are in ground zero absolutely the center of gravity in terms of middle australian aspirations we are prosperous people and we convert our wealth into lifestyle and housing and infrastructure that is my that is my point and that is why you would have faith in the uh in the future of australia let 's have a look at the scale of the pandemic to see how australians have managed these kind of things before um here is a um a list it 's a chart which shows net migration to and from the australian continent from federation on the left and i 've projected out to 2025 on the right the freidenberg 's budget papers in november of last year budget assumptions i agree with these assumptions and your eye will go to the the red bar going down that 's the current financial year and that says that we are losing 70 000 people in net terms we normally attract two hundred and fifty thou we have lost seventy thousand so all the expats coming home have not offset the number of indian and chinese foreign students going home or skilled workers going home and you would say well that 's actually uh reduced demand for housing but it shows in the budget papers coming back maybe 30 000 the following year and then recovery it 's like australia 's falling into a deep sharp crevasse and then we 're coming out of it i actually agree with these assumptions i think that is precisely the trajectory that we are in but it raises another issue of when we were ever in this position before where there was a halt to overseas immigration it 's a bit like australia is an engine we 've got these hydraulic hoses feeding students those hoses what happens on the australian continent when you do that i think that creates an opportunity specifically for uh joondalup which i 'll i 'll get to if you go back in time say well we had an outflow after the second world war i think these were american troops going home you had to go back to uh the great war uh these are the diggers leaving to go to gallipoli in fact and if you have a look at each one of these i regard i consider that australia has been changed quite profoundly by each one of these events anyone who touched the great depression your parents your grandparents perhaps were profoundly shaped by that for the rest of their lives they were frugal for the rest of their lives it raises the question of well if people who experience a great depression were frugal for the rest of their lives what will happen on the other side of an event like this will we be obsessed with security with hand washing for another two decades or so into the uh into the future i focused more family focused more uh more focused on security insurance uh would be key businesses to be in as a as a consequence of of this and it sets the agenda for what we can expect in the um in the coming years uh after the uh after the pandemic let 's have a look and see what the impact is on australia of suddenly cutting the overseas immigration cutting the borders in fact um i want to show you some figures relating to the workforce skilled workers effectively here is the figures for uh for perth showing the net growth in the workforce between the last two censuses between 2011 and 2016 perth as a metropolitan area added 62 000 workers in net terms largely skilled workers coming in from overseas foreign students going into the workforce and you can see that uh uh perth actually capped around about 9 000 fro workers from within the australian continent but it means that 86 of perth 's workforce growth over a five-year period came from overseas you 've now kinked that hose australia as a whole has kinked that 12 months i reckon the second 12 months it becomes unbearable and there is a requirement for skills upskilling reskilling for um increasing the levels of employment and that is precisely the focus uh what we 're going through at the moment where would joondalup what kind of skill sets what side of product what sort of services what sort of businesses would be in demand in that environment i 'd say education and skills edith cowen university the northern tafe metropolitan uh facility skills and workers is what we need to produce over the next five years or so there 's an immediate requirement for that so that 's perth at 86 percent when you do this for sydney it 's about 67 when you do it for melbourne it 's about 65 perth is exposed extraordinarily to the requirement for skilled workers you need to produce those locally this is an area of expertise for joondalup uh to focus on and for perth as a whole uh i would say when you look at it for western australia it 's a little softer and you take into account you look at uh australia uh perth is uh particularly exposed in this area in this area there needs to be a solution a local solution to that so skilling workers attracting workers from uh interstate would be a business uh to be in let 's take a bigger picture perspective and look at what has driven the west australian economy thus far in the 21st century between february 2000 and february 2021 the first 21 years of the 21st century where has job growth been created in the state of western australia these are mega trends if you like what business should you have been in over the last 20 years in the west this is the idea it 's never the numbers numbers are boring it 's the story it 's the context it 's the momentum behind the numbers that indicate the direction that you need to be in what this is is that western australia has added 471 000 net extra jobs over the last 21 years uh perth or western australia has lost 22 000 jobs uh they 've been offshored to guangzhou uh this has done that we saw that as a strategic thing to do less so these days i would imagine uh agriculture one farmer buys out the neighbor the neighbor then moves to nearest big city or in fact uh to the coast particularly in the wheat belt the aggregation of farms you can see that is a mega trend if you like but the opportunities are up here so what 's that 450 000 jobs in net terms in 21 years around about uh a quarter of those have been in health care and social assistance if i was thinking in 2000 what kind of businesses should the city of joondalup dominate health and education what sectors have you dominated health and education and not just universities but vocational training as well and so yes i 'd like that really big tick when you certainly number two is mining you kind of get that so mining technology mining skills mining services mining accoutrement would be businesses to be in over the last 21 years probably agree with that then professional service then construction then education you actually find this exactly the exception of mining it 's down here but the top four or five you think well you know what 's what 's the common denominator between the top four or five sectors that you should have been in and building businesses in and delivering services and infrastructure around because i think there is a common denominator that runs laterally across all of those these are skills these are people that have either a university education or technical training this is the infrastructure that an institution like the city of joondalup should be focused on delivering the infrastructure to enable australians to prosper in those sectors in those industries that are naturally blooming and blossoming over a 21-year period is the is the point um so in fact that 's the that 's the mega trend and it sets the bigger picture agenda then comes the pandemic what businesses should you have been in not over 21 years over the last 12 months the australian bureau of statistics produced this little-known little appreciated under-appreciated data set that i appreciate they they show an estimate of the number of people employed with february 2021 subtract one from the other and you have the fastest growing jobs on the australian continent throughout a pandemic organize them by industry which industries which jobs specifically should you have focused on 12 months ago here 's that list and in fact uh the first one is logistics transportation distribution warehousing logistics in fact commercial property industrial property would be a business to be in china in the middle to outer suburbs of melbourne noble park or sydney you know bankstown out to liverpool or in perth 's northern suburbs you would say would be a business we 're just as consumeristic just as materialistic as ever we 're perhaps less likely to go through a shop but we want the product produced hopefully in australia manufactured in australia and then distributed so distribution systems supply chains there were 34 000 net extra store persons employed in the last 12 months you don 't kind of need a four-year degree to do that there are opportunities everywhere and this is the point of australia we need to be providing opportunities yeah at the top end but you think about that supply and distribution procurement managers were in hot demand the fastest growing job on the australian continent over the last 12 months is in technology it 's that job multimedia manager and web page designer along comes a pandemic your business has to shut its doors what do you do we 'll go online how do i do that i call a geek a 300 increase in the geek population over the last 12 months that is a business to be in have a look at the market capitalization of apple corporation it 's now about 2.2 2.3 trillion dollars uh 12 months ago is about 1.4 it 's it has almost doubled in value anything in technology microsoft and apple uh as businesses and right down two geeks in fact um and so uh you can see the other ones that have emerged as well and then health and pharmaceutical you kind of get that as a pandemic but this is part of a long-term straight trend so health and wellness and well-being um are businesses an extra 14 000 pharmacists they 've come out 've come out of other businesses back into pharmacy kind of get that the same with gps so medical centers medical property would be another business so commercial industrial health wellness medical centers would be businesses to be in over the next 10 years i would say and then agriculture nothing to do with the pandemic i say this has everything to do with drought busting summer rains that we had in january 2020 thank goodness we had the drought broken otherwise regional australia from east to west would have had to contend with the pandemic as well as with a drought but the reality is the regions are blooming they are booming they are greening in fact there is a flight out of our capital cities including perth not the same degree as melbourne and sydney of course uh where you 've got um this virus escapees escaping the city i 've given them an acronym i 've called them the virus escapees seeking provincial australia these are the vespers uh that are scootering scootering out of our capital cities looking for their very own bonnie dune escape north and energy into those communities the abs released new figures two days ago forty thousand australians have left a capital city to go to the regions in 12 months predominantly melbourne and sydney you see that here in in perth to some extent uh as uh as well 40 000 people off a base of 10 million means nothing in terms of but it needs a big impact on cute little towns up the coast or down the coast or tree change towns in fact these would offer opportunities of course for businesses uh in those areas let 's uh pretend that the pandemic does not exist what is the underlying demographic trends shaping the next five years you 're running a business your house your life your mortgage is on the line you are responsible for staff i get all that you 've got to get this right no point telling me about what 's happening in 10 or 20 years time i want to know what is happening right here right now what is going to shape my environment my business environment literally over the next five years western australia from 2021 to 2026 it 's the influenceable future when you look at it so what this shows is the number of people added to every single year of age and your eye will go immediately to number 43 and that shows that in western australia there 's gonna be another six thousand forty three year olds in five years time it also says that if you are 43 years of age today you are dreadfully common in fact it 's a most common age group and the reason why it 's 43 is because this is the first wave of the millennial generation they are the children of the baby boomers they will jump over x 's and j the 43 year olds and you think well it 's not just 43 it 's 42 41 438 this whole wave of them coming what happens in the life cycle around late 30s early 40s you partner up you have one two three or more kids you 've probably had some success in the workforce and you think i need to come out of my hipster apartment in need a house with a front yard and a backyard and a zoom room so that i can work from home and i 'm going to pay whatever is required to do that where does joondalup sit in that narrow slap bang in the middle this is the idea of saying well here is here is the logic of demographic saying here is why you would have faith in the future of australia faith in the future of a place like the city of joondalup is uh is my argument uh in fact so yes uh the surge in 43 year olds uh over the next uh five years or so let 's um let me take you further and i want to show you the age profile of what i call the goat 's cheese curtain in in perth the goat 's cheese curtain is that collection of inner city municipalities generally within a five kilometer radius of the cbd so in melbourne it includes fashionable north fitzroy and sydney includes surrey hills of course uh and in perth of course it includes you know subiaco and and other of age at the last census for south perth perth subiaco victoria park and vincent and you can see it peaks at around about 31 or 32. peak hipster is 31 or 32. it 's also focused around university education and so forth so you come into the city and you you live that lifestyle you don 't have kids you don 't have a mortgage and you live a particular lifestyle let 's overlay that with joondalup and you can see it 's almost like uh the um uh you actually see and put some uh some labels around this the peak outflow from joondalup at around about 32 and possibly possibly going directly into the city of perth and then they come back the great realisation the great awakening of hipsters is around about the age of 38 39 or 40. what is the fastest growing age group in the state of western australia over the next five years that 's where you need to be they 're going to flip they 're going to flip from the inner city up the mitchell freeway until they find salvation why this is why you would invest in property or commercial property or residential property or skills training or whatever it is in that kind of place at that kind of time in the life cycle when you think it all settles down later in the later in the life cycle we have a census every five years there 's a new one due in august of this year uh at that census we will ask 62 questions the americans have a census every 10 years and they ask 12 questions we have an incredible range and depth in our census and i 've looked at the city of joondalup to see what 's different what 's unique what 's fascinating about this place mind you i say that about every community because i find every community fascinating if you just look at the highest concentration of family formation 25 to 39 year olds you 're in business you 're harvey norman you 're a bunnings you 're building new homes where do you need to be in the city of joondalup you can use the demographic and say well 39. but in craigie it is 29 so you have an overweighting of young first home owners and buyers uh in that market then heath ridge and belden and so forth so you can actually target which areas uh to be in the other question that i particularly like goes to civic mindedness we ask people did you volunteer over the last month or so and across australia the average is 21 percent of people over the age of 18 said yes i did volunteer you know they could lie of course but what 's the point of that but if you go to somewhere like marmion it is 27 very civic-minded when you think about it when that new census you get the results in november of 2022 if i was running city of joondalup then i would say this my key performance indicator i just don 't want all these bits and pieces of infrastructure i want civic connectivity and i want to benchmark how my community my municipality my suburbs compare with similar suburbs in other parts of perth and with other parts of australia civic mindedness want the best infrastructure the best quality of life the best opportunities the best businesses and the most connected community this is my point is that i think we should not be just arguing to get back to normal i think we should be thinking now boldly and ambitiously about rebuilding a better version of the australia of the city of joondalup that we left behind when we come out of this i think there is a better version of australia uh going going forward the other part of the sense i particularly like is a question that asks what is your religious affiliation and it 's effectively asking whether you believe in god or not and um across australia uh 77 percent of the population say they are catholic or presbyterian or buddhist or muslim or whatever it is they are believers if you like but if you go to a luca on the beach it 's 80 percent it 's the most god-fearing community and uh i suspect it 's an age community i suspect that i haven 't been there myself maybe not i 've just defended hillary 's very you know conservative uh people you would say conservative values you go down to somewhere like craigie uh clearly the most godless place in the city of joondalup when you think of it like that but again this is the point of the census you can actually see the rise and fall the colour and movement of the different suburbs of a place like the city of joondalup let 's uh let 's go further i want to show you it 's probably my favorites and these are all my favorite slides of course but it shows you the percentage change in gdp quarter by quarter over the last uh 50 years from 1970 on the left through to december of 2020 on the right and euro will go immediately to june 2020 and you can see there 's a decrease of seven percent our economy went backwards by seven percent in uh june of last year uh and then we came out of it like a rocket in fact this is my argument that we 're sort of coming out of it very very strongly and last 30 years we have not had a recession for the last 30 years across australia and this has built a culture of uh expectation we 've upped the ante in how we expect to live um we used to be happy with the caravan holiday of the coolangatta caravan park or the geraldton haraldon caravan park uh now we want a jetstar holiday to bali we 've lifted the bar of expectation is the uh is the point and you can see how all of this plays out in the way we live and the way we live has been profoundly changed by the work from home movement i 've been tracking this through the um through the censuses for 25 years at the 1996 census five percent of the workforce work from home uh that did not change for the following four censuses and the logic was if you 're working from home back then the thinking was that you 're watching daytime television or something like that along comes the pandemic and that proportion increased about 45 there are a number of surveys done particularly on the is will it go back to 5 because i don 't think it will i think it 'll go back to something like 10 or 15 every 5 percentage points you increase the proportion of workers working from home you take 600 000 commuters off the roads and the reason why i think that this is part of our lifestyle going forward is because it connects with a core value of the australian people it contributes to their ideal of lifestyle and if you ask a millennial do you want to live in on the edge of perth and commute into the city centre and then back out again five days a week for a 35-year career or do you want the option of working from home and i think the millennials will say i want to work from home in fact this has a profound impact on the shape of the family home in places like joondalup here is the family home from uh 70 years ago this is the 1950s the kind of house that i was brought up in not the house the kind of house three mum 's a housewife two kids bunk beds per bedroom if you were to visit this house your grandparents house back in the 1950s you go up the pathway onto the porch called the porch and then you turned right into the lounge room the lounge room was a modern incarnation of the parlor the parlor was the good room there was only one good room back in the 1950s the good room was where you entertain guests and suitors suitors never got near a bedroom back in the 1950s it 's very different today and off to the side is a mahogany side stand with a silver tea service the idea here was to showcase wealth and prosperity in a single room fast forward to today to the post pandemic world and here is how we live here is how you live it 's not a thousand square meter block it 's only 600 square meters but it is four bedrooms not three bedrooms there 's two bathrooms not one bathroom it 's two incomers not one income earner and two kids not four kids if you were to through the entirety of the house to showcase your wealth and prosperity affected past the open doors to the bedrooms which means the bedrooms must now be glimpse perfect and this has led to the pillow vacation of the bedroom over the last decade or so and and and men can never get the pillow architecture right you grab the pillow by its ears you fluff them up you drop it in position the karate chop in the middle to give it this perfect v this is as important to us today as was the silver tea service a generation ago then we take our guests and we mill around an island bench since the island bench must move up market there 's now marble italian marble in waterfall style and rising out of the center of it is a silver german gooseneck tap tapware is now the new silverware it matters to the colonial australians the italian marble german tapware are in the recommended greeks the italians arrived in the 1950s that have said to each other what the hell are those australians doing living in an english house have indoor outer you 're right it took us 30 years the most plastic pliable absorbent tolerant changeable people on earth started to cherry-pick out with tea in with coffee in with arugula in with olive oil we started to kiss each other on the cheek and we 've changed our homes the back deck is now called alfresco in the surface and this is my point you will actually see this house not just in joondalup you will see it in glen waverly in melbourne you 'll see it in hornsby and sydney i think that this speaks to a common value of the australian people we 're obsessed with housing lifestyle and the accoutrement that goes with that there must be enablers of this house in every one of these places bed bath and table bbq 's galore bunnings harvey norman they must be in this area because we hold these values dear to us this is where we spent our wealth in the last 30 years and delivers an extraordinary quality of life and we will want that quality of life to continue exactly in places like here is how perth sydney melbourne and brisbane particularly looked for the first 150 200 100 years ago over the last 200 years in the case of sydney it 's like the fried egg model of urban planning we had the cbd and the inner suburbs inside the goats cheese curtain and then the flat white of suburbia extending in every direction 50 kilometers up the coast 50 kilometers down the coast or more and the idea was that you get workers from the edge to the city centre and then back out again that is inefficient it 's not good for our mental health it 's not good for carbon emissions why would you do it would actually start to rethink that model going forward interestingly this suburbia uh was parodied brilliantly in our culture by barry humphries as edna average and then by catherine kim and my personal favorite is daryl kerrigan uh in fact so we 've sort of nailed that uh that culture here is what i think lies on the other side it 's the rise of what i call the 20-minute city this is on about this for 20 years i reckon they nicked the idea from the paris strategic plan 2000 the 20 minutes was based on iran dismissed we may not have arrondissements might be a 30-minute city but the idea is you live work play recreate go to university go to the hospital go to a cafe go on a bike path get skills training all within your local area and what that will do is strengthen these 20-minute hubs where does joondalup fit into this in terms of healthcare and education and training and the kind of quality of life that you would expect over the next uh 12 months or two five years or so i think it 's precisely uh on target i 'm just going to take two more minutes i want to show you a left field data set been showing you data sets from the census um here is the result of um in fact i 'll do i 'll go through this slide uh instead of that here is what i think outer metropolitan regional centres require it 's my checklist it 's not turning up to these places do have airport access yes whatever it is 20 minutes uh 30 minutes to the airport do you have a university campus campuses uh in fact do you have vocational training tick tick tick you would say do you have a training in base hospital well actually the largest hospital under construction or planned in western australia you have local paper preferably paper as well as online do you have a conference facility you 're actually in it at the at the moment do you have an arts and culture center i have noticed around australia that the latest must have is not just an arts and culture center but a modern art facility i know you 've seen moma in perth or in fact the monash modern art gallery at monash university in suburban melbourne aged care private school do you have a business awards program do you actually celebrate people that build businesses locally do you have a cafe culture uh clearly you you do town centre of course diverse housing ideally a marginal seat i know the politicians here don 't want community is united if it if it shares a common vision and it 's up to the leadership i think to actually here is my vision here is where we 're going not by 2050 2025 2030. if people share a common vision they 're more likely to make sacrifices i 'll go without now in order to participate and deliver that common vision of course and lifestyle zone access well i 'm thinking up the coast down the coast the swan valley of course all within easy reach i should be in real estate i really should selling precisely uh the the city of joondalup i think i 've pretty much run out of time i 'll leave it at that thank you very [Applause] much _"

couple of months in pulling this program together with my colleague beck kennedy and enjoy this workshop and she harriet thank you rasheed hi everybody i 'm just gonna pop on and share my screen okay perfect so i 'm hoping you can all see that and so thank you very much for the instruction nasheed and yes i 'm harriet from your sales co i created um your sales co we launched back in july and after working and full time and running another business and within the city of june as well so i 'm going to give you a little bit more about me but we 're going to jump into what you 're going to be getting out of today 's session so what 's in it for me is one of the most effective ways to sell and within your organization and what that means is that we 're looking at how you can articulate your product or service benefit and benefits to your potential clients based on you on their needs and or goals and you 'll see a huge difference in your sales conversion rate so after today 's session and i 'm pleased to have more positive views on sales as on how you can understand your clients better so you can truly meet their needs as nasheed said if you 've got any questions at all please pop them in the chat box and i 'll aim to answer as many as possible during the session and at the end and if you do have to pop off we 'll make sure we 'll do a wrap up with any questions that were answered that will help the majority of you in the audience so as i said a little bit about me so i love sales love love love sales and but i haven 't always it took me a few years to really understand sales and how it helped people i understood the psychology behind it and i 've worked in so many different industries and different roles that i 've really built up my passion for sales because i can really see how it can help other people and now that 's my aim is to help businesses help their clients and through sales so over the last 15 years i 've won awards for top performing 've set up two businesses within actually within the city of joondalup so one of um the most recent achievements was through the cyber security industry and software and i was able to take the business from from a little over doing a zero revenue per month to over 9.8 million per year reoccurring revenue i 'm passionate about supporting you and passionate about supporting businesses and i 'm now able to do what i love helping people around the world and i 've got clients in the uk in australia in america and and so yes i 'm really here just to share more about what it is that i 've learned and how you can apply that into your businesses so with that we will jump straight in so sales and marketing generally gets used within the same term so we talk about sales and marketing i like to think of them as yin and yang you need them both you need a little bit of one a little bit the other so marketing gets you seen and brings the people to you the sales converts those people of money and a lot of time on marketing but no time or no effort on sales you 're gonna get all these people that see your business and all these people that see you 're offering but nobody that 's actually being able to help them convert into a paying clients just the same as if you did loads of sales and every lead you got you were you know trying to shut down the sales conversation with them without that you 're not going to get as many leads so we do need a bit of both but today we 're focusing on sales not as much marketing and but again marketing i find is generally more widely spoken about and it 's easier to find different tools through google facebook things like that it 's quite easy to pick up whereas sales we then just think okay well then once they 've seen us they 'll come in and they 'll buy and unfortunately that 's not always the case so sales is not a dirty word so a lot of people talked about sales we think talked about and who are if i was to ask you who 's a sales person or could you describe a sales person they 'll generally say car sales people they 'll say sleazy and trustworthy they don 't listen they 're out for themselves they 're pushy and and i 'm sure there 's many many more and i 'm sure you 're all smiling behind your cameras today i 'm thinking about that salesperson they 're usually greasy oversized or fitting suits and but unfortunately that is what we think about so when i teach sales and when i work with businesses about sales there 's a lot of pushback and there 's a lot of withdrawal when we talk about sales and that i don 't want to sell i don 't want to be that negative person but actually successful sales people need a lot of skills listening they have to have empathy they have to be able to clearly articulate a product or service offering and many sales people go from industry to business to business and so on and so they 're constantly having base that they 've got so thinking about that a salesperson is actually building a successful sales person is a skill it 's like learning anything if you 're a marketeer you have to learn marketing if you 're a skilled person if you 're a tradesman you have to learn a certain trade so think about it in that way and that sales is not going to come to you tomorrow you 're not going to watch this session and all of a sudden you 're going to be amazing at sales and think about it as a skill think about it as development think about it as how you can take some of the elements that we 're going to go through today and really start to learn and build them within your businesses and and soon you will start to see the benefits of doing that and but for now make sure you take lots of notes like i said ask lots of questions and the main thing around selling is i talk about authentic sell selling and i talk about selling through service and selling through we 're sharing our why and a lot of you today shared um your challenges on the application form around conversion around around and difficulty within that sales process but when we look at authentic selling about delivering an outcome a product or a service and aligning that to your clients needs that 's very different to showing a sales conversation or sales pitch down their throat so i 'm just shared on here some of the challenges that you have shared at that application stage so some of the challenges were conversion converting quotes into sales customers buying solely on price getting the right messages to the right customers converting sales inquiries into customers so again your conversion having a structure for selling to clients articulating different offerings within the sales conversations so if you 've got multiple um offerings that you might want to discuss as part of one sales conversation and then communicating value within those within those and conversations as well so over the next few slides we 're going to answer all of this and i just wanted to highlight that area because i get challenges that you 've got and i know that you 're going to see value from these next few slides so and like i said if you 've got any questions if it needs to be more specific to you just let me know and through the chat box and i will jump on and answer any of those as we go through so qualification and is the big issue is at the beginning so you get an inquiry what do you do next you may be contacting them you may be responding say thanks for your inquiry but really what we 're trying to do at that point is really understand exactly what it is that they need or what they want so when you know what your client needs or wants you can tailor that conversation to align your product or service to what it is that they need now qualification is not a sales interrogation the idea is to not bombard them with questions to get exactly what you want out of it part of qualification is building relationships so the aim within this component or this use effective pauses and silences and allow the client to speak as much as possible we use the who what where when how questions to get information flowing and i 've just popped on here on the screen it says use wide questions carefully as they can sometimes see confrontational and again it depends on the type of person you you 're speaking to it depends on the relationship you 've built by this point but by using the open questions you 'll get the most information out of your clients or your prospects and therefore you 'll be able to build up a better knowledge base about them so give you some examples here of um the qualification questions opening so what are you looking for from this product or service what challenges you currently experiencing what are they trying to get out of this conversation so why have they reached out to you today what did they see specifically how do they think you can help you how do you think you can help them sorry and and who is looking after maybe those elements of what they 've seen some of the of the industries that have jumped on so if we look at trades for example so we 're looking at plumbing we 're looking at electrical and that within that instance that they 're looking for a service they 're looking for an outcome and it could be a large project it could be a once-off it could be something that somebody 's fixed but not yet done a good enough job and we 're just trying to unlock all of that information because if we really know what they 're trying to achieve we can then pitch them the best solution the best project outcome for them so if they 're looking at reading their kitchen they 're looking for certain services within that kitchen do we know what component that they 're looking for do we know who else is involved in this project do we know what their timeline is do we know what happens if they don 't get what they 're looking for from you today or from another service provider do we know what budget they 're looking for anything that they 've experienced previously that maybe has given them a negative view of that specific trade if so what was it if so how could you overcome it and you know what is stopping them making the decision today so we 're asking them all these questions to really understand the type of project they 're doing what it is that they want to do what outcome they 're looking for and therefore then all we 're looking for then is how we can close the gap between what it is that they want and what it is that you can deliver now when we talk about closed questions we talk we use closed questions to qualify something that your client has said or to take the conversation a slightly different direction so we call these bridging statements and close questions and then and then clarification or confirmation so if you were going to give an example in here so do you have a budget set do you have an investment level or investment approved for this project the answer is going to be a yes or a it a little bit further so if yes you 've got a budget set okay great what are the considerations or requirements to be aware of within the budget approval who else has got to give approval is there any stumbling blocks that they could foresee during now and the project being approved if no how do you aim to get that approval without budget approval there 's no deal there 's no there 's going to be no um sale close there 's gonna be no money crossing hands so that gives you an example of how you can really dive a little bit deeper into one of your open questions where maybe you want to clarify something a little bit further now i 'm just going to jump on just to see if there 's any questions achieved if you 've seen anything feel free to shout at me at this stage there 's none so i think if you 're okay as they pick up or oh i 'll feed them to you perfect all right lovely and okay so we 're going to jump into features they need so we 've qualified we 've really understood we 've asked the hard questions we 've asked some close questions to really make sure that we 've confirmed that we understand we 've used those bridging statements within those closed questions so another example of that would be um that you mentioned this can i confirm that you mean this by that statement so you mentioned that you are looking to have this done in in june or july and am i right and understanding that the project has to be finished by july so therefore we really understand the parameters that within that project which will just give us more understanding and then more questions that we can ask and or more clarification that we can ask during it so features and benefits is my favorite topic and and the reason i love this topic so much is because this is the biggest space that gets missed out as part of the sales process in my opinion so if you can understand the difference between a feature and a benefit you can really dwell and truly unlock and that will hinder your sales flow if we give too many features and not enough benefits this is where the wiffen comes in now with film was something that was taught to me many many many years ago in england one of my first sales jobs that we talked about within it was stamped on the you know on the top of our monitor screen and and it stands for what 's in it for me and what we 're trying to do here is really just remind you to step back and really put yourself in your client 's shoes so if you were understanding where that client is you 're thinking okay this is me i 'm the client these are my challenges these are my outcomes and i 've reached out to this company to help me what is really going to be in it for me what do i want this person to say to me that 's going to make me realize that they 've understood my needs that they understand my requirements that their right business to help me and that they 've time we 're looking at a feature so something that is that you do within your business and then it benefits something that you know benefit back to the clients we 're always trying to turn it around to what 's in it for me and so once we understand that we can really deliver the right benefits so here we go and so in here i 'm just going to give you a bit of a of an overview of my um description of a feature and benefits so a feature is a description of what 's included in your product or service so it could be then like for example if we use trades again we 've got them that you know features that you provide on-site plumbing services you provide on-site electrical work and some of the other industries we had and it 's got it sales so we 've got then the fact that you sell laptops you sell servers and you might offer a 24x7 help desk so these are all features they 're not beneficial and a benefit explains what the feature does for how will it help them overcome their challenge or get them closer to their desired outcome so again we 'll know if we 've given a feature and a feature if we cannot answer the with them so with them is something i want you to write down i want you to highlight it i want you to remember every single time you 're speaking to somebody and even do it when people are speaking to you i 'm a really bad person now to be sold to because i 'm always looking and thinking about okay they 've not understood my requirements they 've not listened they 've not asked me any open questions they 're trying to pitch me on some features that actually don 't really benefit me and so i 'm you know i 'm laughing about it because it because you will start to see it the more you understand the sales process and how it is that we 're just aligning products and services and with a design outcome you 'll soon start to see how people do it really well in the outside and therefore you can learn on that and you can do better now the list is a feature and benefit table and that i have created and i do this with every single client that i work with without sale even if they think they 've nailed it even if they think they can really clearly articulate a benefit to me i will still get them to outline this within their organization now you don 't need to start scribbling or taking screenshots you are going to get a copy of this um through the city of joondalup and and i will also give you a secondary table so this table gives you a feature benefit and a story so if you can go through your business and i encourage you to do this weekly monthly and start adding to it you might have 100 features you might find 200 features you might find five and but as you 're building it through i want you to list your features and then go through and then think about the benefit so remember you 're with him so that benefit can can be a one line it can be a one word if you can really nail it in that in that short short space then we then add in a story so we talk about how somebody else has experienced the success when working with you for that particular feature for that particular outcome now you want to find something where they have and i call it the little golden nugget and it 's really something where it says like i said it 's a similar challenge it 's a similar feature a similar benefit a similar outcome or a similar reluctancy to go ahead with something and you 're able to share that in here now when i said about a secondary table i also have a different table that i use for people that are predominantly online and don 't get to speak so much through to their clients and so what that will look like is a feature benefit and a story but then we 'll then have them a key message and also an image potentially for socials so you 'll get both of those on use even if you are more face-to-face you might still want to add in those extra columns and but this is something you can keep going back to and it 's also a really good thing to have when you 're growing your team or when you 're looking to expand that or have as part of your playbook for the whole business i mentioned briefly then story and telling and storytelling really adds in that extra step when we 're talking about features and benefits and what 's in it for me for the clients so if we can talk about and say okay we really understand exactly what it is that you need or that you want or the required outcome we 've got the right product or the right service for you these are some of our features that relate to what it is that you require here 's some of the benefits so this is what it actually means to you if you were to go ahead and this is how we can combat what it is that you 're looking for and then i 'm 've helped somebody in that same situation so if we take the example of i 'm going to use an i.t sales so if we take that example where we 've said okay they 've got a requirement they need a laptop or they need a refresh laptop within their within their organization we understand why they need that what are they replacing who else are they looking at what budget has been set what the parameters are and if there 's any key areas within that that may help their and their employees do a better job we 've then understood that the features around that we can talk about the features of the vendors that we work with the brands that we work with and we can then give you the um understand the why we 've chosen to work with work with those brands some of the key other customers that are doing well within there and then some benefits so for example if you want to share um that you work with hp so a feature might be that we work with hp and hp can you know the right outcome for you with the different specifications depending on departments and then the feature for that means that you 're only getting what you need you 're only getting the right device that 's specific for your and for your users which means you 're not having to pay more because if i 'm getting an i7 instead of an i5 that actually my device as a service platform will tell me that i need an i5 so therefore i can save you money by ensuring that you 're only giving the right devices to the right people so that should benefit and then a story could then be that i worked with a business that was looking to review their dell solution and they 've got 500 laptops within the organization and and what they were really struggling with they wanted to stick with the same the same vendor and we went ahead and provided an overview with hp we were able to do a a demonstration within their within their office we were able to give them and some trial units and from there to a save money but by rolling out and having the same device across their entire organization they were able to be allocated account manager from hp which meant that their fixing time is going to be shorter and and so on and so forth so do you see that whole story from end to end that we were able to create from saying i understand exactly what it is that you need i understand that and the products and services that i offer these are some of the features these are some of the benefits of what 's in it what 's in it for you and then i 've then been able to give you a story of an example of how i 've helped somebody now again those stories may be smaller than maybe just identifying one challenge or one feature and feel free to share a couple of them because people like to hear when you 've done something and with somebody else where they 've been able to help in a similar challenge so i 've given some examples at the bottom of this of of my clients one of our clients are struggling with x we work together on this and we were able to achieve these outcomes so again just a really simple statement that you can take a screenshot of now you can take a picture of you can write it down and you can also share challenges so if you 've got a client that is trying to and overcome a challenge maybe it 's around cost or it 's around actually implementation of the product or service that you 're delivering is i had a similar challenge we suggested doing this and because of these reasons maybe a feature and a benefit we were able to achieve that specific outcome for them so again we 're looking at these statements we 're looking at having them lined up and ready to go so that you can come back to it at any point now when we look at unique selling points the usps as you may have seen them called this is how you showcase your unique deliverables or offerings and how you distinguish yourself and your business from the read and in the um in one of your in the participants application and it was understanding or delivering your unique selling points and how do we differentiate it and i think it was um if i 'm not wrong i think it might been a gym and so we 're looking at how many businesses are out there and we 're looking at how many um how saturated potential that market is and how the unique selling points are getting closer and closer but what we like to do and here and this is what i do with a lot of my clients is that we review the offering so we review the type of gym that it is we would review the type of services that are on board we would review the type and how you recruit the type of personal trainers you have the background in personal training you have and maybe think about some of the areas where you 've had members come to you that have had maybe issues elsewhere now again what you 'll hear me say or not hear me say is off the competition we don 't talk negatively about any decisions that people have made because they can be sometimes quite personal and so generally you want to understand why so if we 're going to look at the gym and i 'm going to use the gym in this example is that we understand our offering we understand the promise of the clients we know what we don 't want to be and we know what we do want to be so what we could do in this instance is maybe do a survey within the um within the memberships to understand why did they move from another membership to come to you and you know what have they heard about other about other gyms that that put them off going there and instead came to you why they choose you over everybody else and again it could be a special offer which therefore again narrows it down slightly and but it could be around feeling comfortable in the gym it could be around and you know not feeling out of place it could be around having the right we 're looking for so we really want to delve deeper and really understand our clients a little bit further so in that case i would suggest something like i just said around a survey and maybe getting somebody to fill something out if you 've got maybe some members that have been with you for over six months maybe do an incentive for them to sit with you one-on-one maybe ask them for five minutes of your of their time and ask them some questions so you can delve a little bit deeper because sometimes you might necessarily know what to ask until you 've had the conversation with a few of them and then you could roll out a survey throughout and maybe put them in a in a draw to win a free personal training session and it just really just encourages them to share their experiences and even if you did something that is maybe um anonymous they are more often and likely to give better feedback and say something maybe more that maybe seems more negative than what they might get if they 're putting going through regardless of what your business is again there 's usually somebody doing the same thing that we 're already doing with you know everybody 's doing something slightly different or has found a gap so think about the gap that you found within your market why did you set up your business why what was your passion what drove you to do what you 're doing today review what that offering is write out your promise to your clients and highlight those to get your highlighter write them through highlight them on your document highlight the key reasons that people will buy from you and review these against the competition if you are in quite a high um market sector then i would recommend that you do this more frequently because you don 't ever want to have the same one two or three as somebody else and so and then that will then also help you with your key messages so just to recap on that you look at reviewing your offering understand what your promises to your clients get some feedback and understand why your clients against competition add in a reminder to review these every month two months or three months depending on how quickly your market is moving okay so i 'm just going to check in here to see if there 's any questions okay we 're all good we 're being very quiet today and i think we might get a few questions at the end i think it 's been really engaging i 'm learning a lot myself harriet so awesome okay wonderful yes like i said ask away because i will answer anything so i 'm just going to put that out there if you 've got anything you want to put me on the spot i love it because i can then show you then there 's certain things that we 've learned today that you can actually apply so like i said please don 't hold back check them through so in your challenges overcome when we look at the challenges given so we look at conversion rate conversion rate converting quotes getting the right clients to buy is all about qualification if we don 't know what something that they don 't necessarily need or want and therefore it 's not aligned if we 're not aligning our quotes they 're not going to buy them because they don 't feel heard and it 's not answering their challenge or what outcome it is that they want converting quotes into sales a game will come into the same thing if we know exactly what it is that those clients want we can pitch the right service or the right product within our proposal and we know all the parameters therefore converting a quote into a sale will be much easier now again customers that buy on price alone will be through your qualification so when we 're talking about understanding the price point we 're understanding the challenges but understanding and the parameters that they are going to buy within we can ask some of those more challenging questions if you 're finding that that 's happening all the time you can go back and do a survey with the question with the clients that didn 't buy because they found it cheaper elsewhere you could then wanted because again then you get to share that as part of your storytelling so i 'll share an example so and i remember working with a client and now my background cyber security i probably should have added that in the beginning why i know so much about i.t so but my background was cyber security and i was working with a client on um their uh their solution for a server refresh and i went in and put my quote in it was a really one of my top clients worked really really closely with him and we were able to go through and we qualified everything i was three i was 100 on this on on this project going ahead i didn 't everything that he needed i designed a specific solution that was going to meet his needs that was going to be within budget and within time frame there was no question whatsoever that something hadn 't gone that 's that had that i 'd missed something so i then get the phone calls then say that he 'd bought it off another provider and could i i gave i gave him a call back and i said can you talk me through what like what happened and you know most customers have to go out they have to get three quotes and what he was able to what we were able to identify was he actually showed me the specification which again was built because i 've got a really good relationship with this client he showed me the specification and in the specification they 'd missed three key points and the three key points were the three key reasons why they needed this solution so i was able to go back to him and confirm that the quote that he had approved actually was missing the three components that he had expressed to me were extremely important so what he was able to do was he was then able to stop the quote he didn 't buy the quote through that provider and he came back to me and because it we built trust so from there moving forward i was even more confident in the fact that what i had given was is that he wanted exactly what it is that he needed i understood the buying parameters and the budget restraints and even the time frames i was able to quote based totally on that and then when he was when he then came back to me and said no i was able to then challenge him on that because i knew that what i 'd offered was exactly right so when we look at customers that are buying on price they 're generally not always the customers that we want and or we haven 't asked enough enough questions or they haven 't provided the truthful information what i always say to clients especially when we 're in that competitive space is that if i 'm working with somebody that has already had two quotes we 're going to know that in the qualification we 're going to know who else they 're looking at have they reached out to anybody else already have they seen something they really like that maybe they want to make sure they 're going to get out of my service or product when we two other people so i want to qualify is this quote a third quote for price or do you actually want to work with us and so asking that really difficult question again the tone of voice that you use the communication structure that you use to ask that question will help you get the right answer so if they say to me look it 's probably just going to be a price if you 're cheaper i 'm going to go with you but if not i 'm going to go with the cheapest then i would encourage you to then say no problem i 'll give you a quote what price you needed to say because what it means then is that you 're putting more value on your time on the product and service that you deliver and therefore that 's more important than spending time giving quotes to people that are just going to use it out for pricing now in a lot of spaces so in the um in the sparring street i own a day spa in in malalu in that space i do 've got different a-frames now i will always check pricing but i will usually do it on an online form or i 'll contact somebody and say this is currently what we 're spending can you give me a guidance as to whether that is above market price but a good market average or below market average or about the same i don 't want to waste time i 'm getting good service from there unless you can tell me there 's a difference there 's a different way to do what i 'm doing for a better a better value offer then i will consider it and so generally again i understand sales so therefore i 'm going to give that upfront information because i don 't want to waste anybody 's time because i wouldn 't want somebody to waste mine but i was suggesting that in that instance around buying on price alone to maybe qualify a little bit further and ask those upfront questions especially if you 're finding that happening and more and more frequently the other thing that you could potentially do is do how that goes again anything we 're doing around sales is just a gauge so if you want to gauge something out try it for three weeks see what happens try it friend try it for two months if it doesn 't work pull it if it works then keep it and you know and you get to just really play around with that but qualification i would say is going to be the best the best place to start and getting the right messages to the right customers will come through qualification but then linking it in with a feature and a benefit from your product or service and structure for selling clients well i think i 've just given you a pretty good one that you can use so again just to recap on the stretch for selling clients we 'll get that at the end and articulating different offerings into the sales conversations now we haven 't so much touched on that one but if we look at and businesses that are selling not just one or two services but potentially for people to maybe buy six so we may look at that one outcome that they 're looking to achieve and through qualification you might start to think about other areas of the service or product that you offer or other products that you offer that may help them so what we 're going to do in that instance is that we would answer their their and their challenges or we 'd answer their qualification with an overview of a feature and benefits within that specific area that they 're looking at we would then qualify out to understand that you mentioned a couple of areas around this can you confirm whether that whether i 've understood that correctly and would you like us to talk and include those um within this discussion today so if we look then at gyms it could then be that they want to join a gym but they also want a pt and a nutritional specialist we 're going to deal with them on their gym membership first because that was their inquiry but what we 're hearing is actually that they want a pity and they want a nutritional about the and about the gym membership we would then say to them look from what else you 've said i really do think that you would benefit from two of our other services that 's personal training and nutrition and the reason that i 'm suggesting that is because of this so we recap on what it is that they gave to us in that qualification we again regain the fact that we can deliver them a package so we can deliver them not only their gym membership but we can give them a personal training element of that membership and nutrition should they wish to then it 's up to them the client then gets to make the decision that they want to just stick with what with what they came on the phone to talk to you about or came in to speak to you about or do they want to look at something else the same goes for if you 're buying a car they want to sell you a car okay great we 're going to buy the car do you now want to buy there 's all of these things that we hear during that qualification process about what 's really important to them and then we 're turning again that round as to what 's in it for them what 's the benefit so the benefit of coming to a gym and not just only focusing on a membership but also getting a personal trainer and the nutrition means that you 've got that one-stop shop you 've got somebody that 's always going to be in the gym they can help you if you tweak if you 're doing something slightly wrong or if you 've got some questions in the meantime we can pair up your gym workout your attendance and your actual program in line with what it is that you 're eating to see better results so do you see how we can then look at qualification for something specific that they wanted we 've understood that and their needs their outcomes their desires we can fit that into features of what it is that our product or service offering offers we tie that into a benefit and give story or a success that we 've seen and then we then potentially look at adding in another product or under the service because we believe that that 's going to give them the best value so just a couple of things around that and now within overcoming all these challenges like we 've talked about is qualify listen link feature the benefit remember what 's in it for me and share a success story again you 'll have your table which should help you with that as well um harriet there 's a couple of things that have popped through do you want to go and then so there 's one from basha which is hi harriet thanks for the useful info would you have real life examples of companies that nail this i 'm most interested in seeing websites and how the usp is positioned on a website oh good question and i generally find that unique selling points that are done really well are hidden into key messages so um i would suggest that some of the big companies like your nikes and your um and like delivery um spaces i 'll i 'll have a look and see if i can if i can come across any because generally the unique selling points are not usually outlined as in these are our unique selling points if they are then it 's quite a brass way of saying this is who we are and this is how we differentiate i would usually encourage for that to be included in the um in key messages or in some of the stories that you 're sharing let me just make a note and i 'll come back to that one and then i can share that with everybody if i can find some sites that clearly articulate that sure i think that 'll be also quite useful for the business catalogue as well because we have yeah a segment and i know it 's a bit brash and bullish but i think that was the whole point is that we can get out to an audience what is it that 's unique about you and giving businesses that opportunity and encouraging them to also think about you know what so that that will be really really useful another question from tom shioria thank you russia and thank you tom for your question do you think buying is more based on emotional um in brackets um so buying there 's a huge psychology around buying and xerox and i don 't know if it 's still published but xerox did and a a paper on um on sale psychology and it talks about how we buy and why we buy and so i do believe that buying is emotional because we 're constantly looking and and i would say that we 're subconsciously looking i don 't think we actively look but we 're looking for that relationship we 're looking to here for somebody to say i get you and i 'm here to support you and so we 're looking for that trust element as well so there 's so many factors that go into sales and when i talked before about sales being a skill is that when we talk about listening and we don 't asking the right questions is that if if you 're asking you build a better relationship because you really feel that they understand you and they and you really feel that they understand their service and their product offering and when that can be articulated with how that will benefit me and how you 've also worked with other people in a similar space i now will feel more comfortable about working with you and people sell p people sell products and people buy from people and so i would say yes it is around that psychology around selling and around buying from somebody that we resonate with and that really understands us but you 've got to have that emphasis within your product or service as well because if you 're selling something that doesn 't meet you might be awesome at sales and this is then again unfortunately what comes into that sales as a dirty word and is that people that sell and are really good at selling can sell anything whether it 's right whether it 's ethical whether it 's in line with their values and whereas what i 'm seeing a lot of you that what i can see or have some passion within the business that and that you are currently working in and so within that that shines through and and so i think yes emotional and and i think then that the communication is really important as well as having a product that actually lives up to the expectations that you set i hope that 's answered your question tom thank you i actually have one if i may just go on back to your challenges i think a couple of questions that raised in my mind were about um what about if you 're trying to upsell a product and you actually don 't have those services so going back to your gym question what if you actually have you don 't have a nutritionist um and it 's something that your client wants or price point matching that you know the price point expectations of your client is a lot less than what your what your product has so how would you overcome some of those challenges okay so if you are if you feel that adding in a different your clients and we give them that whole package then i would highly recommend that you collaborate with somebody or partner with somebody so and anything that i ever do if i 'm looking at a space or a gap that maybe that 's not my specialty or it 's not something that either i 'm passionate about or that it 's not something that i 'm really that good about that i 'm that i 'm good at doing then i will always work with somebody else and so to give you an example and let me think of the event of the of what we 've got in here and so if we look at okay there 's a consulting company in here so within the consulting company that and they are they offer engineering services so within the engineering and space is that to work within on a project you can 't just have an engineering service and or you very rarely can just have an engineering service so what it is that they 'll do or what i would look at doing for them is look areas where they have got decision makers where potentially they see that they could add value into other projects or into other services or if i was the project manager and i was a project manager and i did architecture for example and i go okay now i need a building company and i also need an engineering firm then i would then look to then collaborate and partnership with the other two so the same thing if we look at the gym and example again is that if we then say okay well i 've got the membership i don 't i 've got a personal trainer but i don 't have the nutritional specialist i would put that out there to find somebody that has got that skill set and see whether they would like to collaborate because what then happens is that you get to bring somebody into your business that you trust that has got a speciality that you couldn 't provide currently you get to advertise to their their client base and to your client base you 're effectively doubling up depending on how many able to add another service which means that you take all the money off the table now the saying let 's take all the money off the table is a very salesy saying and and it 's something that i do truly believe in because if you can manage the whole project and whether that be a component and you bring other people in or whether you can provide that sole service and product and get deliver everything that is that they need you can take all the money off the table and what that means is they 're not going to be going elsewhere because the risk comes from if they come to you as a gym and they want a personal trainer and they want the nutrition then they 're going to come to the gym and there 's no personal trainer okay i 'm now going to look elsewhere you come to the gym and you 've got your personal trainer but you 've got no nutrition i 've now got to go and see somebody else that nutritional specialist may offer personal training they may collaborate see her or him and i really like them they 're gonna suggest that i work with a personal trainer because i 'm gonna get the best results when i work with somebody that knows the two that the two parties are working together and then guess what they work at a different gym so i 'm going to go there so again if we relate that into any of the other services if you look at plumbing services and like for example if we 're doing a kitchen project like i did one live beginning of the year so we i needed an electrician i needed a plumber i needed a kitchen designer and and then i needed all these random other things that like you know you painted your tiler your floor and and everything else that comes with that and so i went to one company and i had to go through and manage all of them but every time i spoke to somebody i said can you recommend somebody that you work with because i thought if i could group a few people together it 's that i can get them all to communicate and get the job done smoother and quicker so again when you 're looking at it if you 're a plumber do you know an electrician because a lot of the time they may work you might want to add an electrician into your suite if you start getting asked for that more because again you 'll be able to increase the revenue by only dealing with one project so if that one project is going to give you a thousand dollars if you add an electrician that might cost you 100 an hour you might be able to add in another thousand dollars and so on and so forth or you can refer the business out and do a referral scheme so that 's one way i would overcome in that space and within upselling was that your other question this year it was about price point so you know how you talked about the particular quote um that you know um they didn 't cover the three points and you know you 've gone and met you 've kind of couldn 't match the price point say you know the budget that they had is um out of your range how would you deal with that circumstance and in that instance i would be focused on this because generally what we see in pricing and again everybody 's pricing is is different and you 're pricing it differently depending on what you 're over usually what your overheads are and what that project would actually cost to run plus your margin and is that in that space i would really be wanting to make sure i understand exactly what it is that you 're getting because generally what happens is when you 're more expensive than somebody else 's offering the same and i 'm saying same service is it 's because that service includes different aspects or excludes different aspects so for example um trying to think what we 've got in the group um if i said um i think there 's a branding company in here and is that in the branding and advertising signage space marketing space is that again we might then say okay i to create the and the signs above my shop is that the signs above my shop is a sign and it 's above my shop and it 's the same thing and i 've got the design that i already want and i know what size it 's got to be there isn 't too much different within that but what comes into that component might be durability so it might be that my sign cost five hundred dollars and the other person 's sign costs three hundred and fifty dollars well the clients go well i 'm gonna go with them because they 're only 350. it 's the same size i got the same design and it 's gonna look the same what i 'm gonna have to try and explain within that conversation and this will come from my qualifying is that are you looking to have something that comes in this that 's cheap now and you want to replace later no okay great i know that take that and are you looking for something that 's going to stand the test of time obviously in 're going to have issues with that sea water and you know how how does your stack up against others and so what you might want to explain during that features and benefits process is that the way that you differentiate or one of your unique selling points is that actually that your signage is durable it is more hard wearing than any other in the market because of these reasons so what specific materials are you using how are you coating it how are you caring for it will you come out and care for it and check on it every year do you offer a warranty for it so all of these little things will come in and allow you to then pay a little bit more so when we look then again at like when we look at and say paying for insurance we might choose the more expensive option or we might choose the cheaper option and generally what will happen is we look at okay what does this thing mean to us so if we 've got a car and we go out there and how much excess we 've got to pay and this is what the worth you 're going to give me for the car the chancellor you 're going to pay a little bit more for your insurance that they 're going to give you a lower access and a higher value for your car and if you don 't care about those components you can pay a lower price but you may pay that price if you do ever have to claim so we 're always looking at okay you 've given me your requirements you 've given me what it is that you want i know why i differentiate from the rest and the reason why we differentiate from the rest is because of these reasons so in that signage example is that and that 's in that one off if we 're giving a marketing example where we 're saying we 're going to do a whole rebrand and that 's going to include your sign she 's going to include your color brandy it 's going to include your style guide etc etc is there there 's changes and so the scope that you 're giving me may have everything and you 've really qualified me and you 've got everything in there you may want to highlight some of the areas that you know get missed out during the processes with others with other businesses that they work at then you then if they then are looking at pricing you always want to follow up with your pricing so i 'll go a little bit deeper in this and this is usually we say this usually for another session but from the quoting perspective is that when we 're looking at pricing before it gets to the point where they 've made a decision we want to find out exactly what it is that they and that they 're looking at so we might follow up 24 hours afterwards just want to check you got the quote want to make sure it made it with the spam filter and it 's there okay awesome can we have a call next week to go through it in more detail we might go through it in more detail and make sure that they 've been highlighted we want to understand where they 're at currently in that decision making process and what are their next steps so they might say i 'm waiting on two other quotes to come through from visit from other businesses as i told you i need to get three quotes perfect okay great once you 've got those two can we have another chat i 'd really like to make sure that you understand the difference between our quotes and what you 're being quoted elsewhere so again you get to call that out early and what that allows you to do is then when you get on the phone or get in there face to face you can ask for that honest feedback so you 've now got the other two quotes how do we sit where are we at how do you feel about the quote that we 've put forward and they can then feel then like they can give you that feedback i feel it 's rather expensive i feel like we 've included we haven 't included enough then you get to start to tweak that quote and really tweak their expectations and explain why you 've done something that they 're questioning about because if you truly believe what you 've done and there 's a reason behind what you 've done then they 're going to buy into that because they 're going to really understand why you 've put that forward so does that help you nishad that was really really good and that collaboration you 're absolutely spot on i think that 's such a great way where there is strength in collaboration i think we 're in a world where we focus on buying local supporting local working together and i mean recently you were a part of the digital ready program that was held earlier this year and i felt like the strength in the delivery of that program was we actually commissioned savannah macri to deliver the digital ready program but she also pulled in yourself and liz and a whole host of other local consultants to help deliver a program which benefited our local businesses so there 's a power of that supply chain is really really important yeah totally agree and and there 's and a session that i run for some of my clients which is called collaboration is king and we look at what it is that they 're actually delivering and and how they deliver it and the gaps and then we then look then at other potential businesses within the local area that they might want to collaborate with so that 's just something you might want to look at for your own business and see how other people are doing it and ask them like how are they doing it is it working what has been good what hasn 't been good and reach out to the local community they they i 'm sure that they would be happy to to help you and so i 've just seen another question come on so i 'll answer this one then i 'll jump back into the slides so with give with government tenders there isn 't room to make contact to the assessor until the assessment process is completed now government tenders um are 's solely based on price i don 't know if i 'm allowed to say that um but uh the i 've worked with a lot of government tenders and and the tenders are generally based on price from what i 've seen now the key differentiators in tenders is that i would always say look at what the tender is asking if the tender is written in a way that the tender sounds like it 's written for a specific product or a specific service that and you 're looking at doing something slightly different then i would always question whether that tender 's the right one to respond to and with regards then to the um to the making changes or contact until that 's done is that really look at what has what that specific business or government has done previously so i used to do a lot of tenders and in the i.t space and a lot of government tenders and so i would always look at what it is that they 're doing in the space already so what are they looking to replace and i believe could provide or fulfill a a specific outcome and then make sure that 's outlined in that space when it comes to questions i would always have a really solid list of questions that i 'd want to ask and that 's basically allowing me to qualify without having that face-to-face interaction and also contacting governments to get in touch with them prior to any tenders so to not talk about specific tenders but to understand what is their vision and mission statement what core values do they do they set their day by how can you incorporate that in the tender response that you 're writing that 's gonna appease them or is going to show them the link between what it is that they 're asking and what it is that you can deliver because generally when i talk about them looking at price is that a lot of the time they 're asking for a specific outcome and it might even be led by specific technology so if you 're looking in that space it 's just who can hit the lowest price that will your distributors and if you 're looking at it in any other component and because there 's so many different options that you could be responding to a tender with and i would just say respond to make sure you 're asking the right questions so you are qualifying and at the points that you are allowed to qualify and do your research and find out what they 've done previously so why are they looking to change now do we know if they if they enjoyed that maybe even reaching out to another employee to find out to get some feedback on and you know um i just wanted to find out you 're happy to share what your thoughts are on x y and z or on this level of service or on this type of products so you can really give some insider insights and but generally for the tenders that i was responding to i would respond to tenders that i knew and the businesses already so that i could add the right value or i 'd use a template and then provide then a price whether i could get a shot at it to be able to win the business because again with tenders what i used to find was that i 'd win the business and then there 'd be so much more that came from that tender so sometimes i 'd go in and not make as much money and as what i usually would and but what i 'd be able to do is get deliver the right outcome and the right service for a price and then i 'd now have that relationship that i can use and leverage and share that success in other businesses as well i think you raised a really good point there harriet because i think um agreed i think being able to approach um the various government organizations and get you know um get in touch with them to know more we also have a supplier vendor list we 've got vendor panels so local businesses um can actually list on that and if you 've got queries about that please contact us after this we can send you the details and while we 'll the best of my ability i 'm not at authority on this by any chat any shape or form but when we just from our unit um you do have the opportunity to ask a question which then gets circulated to all the other applicants so that 's the only possible way from what i recall could be a way of putting a question to the person who 's issued the tender or the rfq um but i 'm not an authority on this but i can definitely check with that procurement team and get back to you on what those moms are yeah and you 've also got the and so if you 're looking at local government there 's the wild panel that provides all the information of how they distribute the um uh the tenders and you 've also got the cua so cua and wilder are the two and for the local governments and then there 's so many more there 's tenders.gov.iu and there 's a few other ones on there as well but the city itself has their own vendor panel so we 've as many businesses to get onto that because they will get access to all of our tenders and opportunities as well awesome thank you perfect okay so we 'll jump straight back in so and some of the extra challenges that were shared was around marketing and deciding on funny actually a couple and there was like two or three that mentioned about trying to design whether to expand and without compromising on quality now i would generally say that you know with your marketing with that expansion with how to you know navigate the code restrictions et cetera it doesn 't usually like it wouldn 't usually resonate with a sales conversation however and when we 're looking at marketing services to potential clients we want to look at do we understand our unique selling points have we qualified on our target market or our range of clients that we would usually like to speak to and therefore are we using that within our key messages within our social media campaigns within our email ads within our newsletters those sorts of things so and then marketing services i would some local providers that that could maybe give you some tips or set you up with some baseline and the general ones that i use that i find really simple to use is like your google marketing so google adwords and or your google business if you 're not on google business do it right now once you 've done it right now wait for like 10 minutes and but yeah do the google business it 's the easiest thing to do you can link it through to a gmail account you have to have a gmail account to have it and but that 's a way that people can review you and can leave their reviews you can add in post you can add offers you can add photos you can add details about your business so that 's one of the main areas and then you then got your google ads from there which means you can search your keywords and do some seo updates and all that you can find through google so if you don 't want to pay somebody just spend a bit of time expand how to balance sales without compromising on quality and that 's a two-way street or or a and a see-saw act really because we 're looking at if we can bring in more sales great but can you take more sales and so within that you want to look at how could you expand your business now there 's a book that i 'm going to recommend called the e-myth revisited so it 's the e-myth revisited and i will say watch it let me see if i can put it in the chat um thank you united um so the yes that book is brilliant and that 's all about scaling and it talks about how you can and if you can create your business that can be copied and pasted and scaled or franchised even if that 's not what you want to do it 's not saying you have to do that and then you will have a stronger base stronger foundation for your business so that might give you some answers in whether you should expand and then how to expand efficiently and i 'm so if you can and focus on that and then see what your revenue looks like and then see then whether you can comfortably bring on another person will that then increase your output without adding in extra and room for error those sorts of things so i 'd highly recommend reading that book and then from there you then want to then look then okay how do i start to increase my sales how do i start to increase that bandwidth and within the market so finding new customers again usually comes from that marketing space and cold calling cold emailing linkedin messaging i love all of them and so yeah so that might be that would be my recommendation first is to look at maybe your marketing strategy and then look at how you 're going to go to market but if you understand what your unique selling points are understand what your features and benefits are you can qualify over the phone and or you can reach out to them with an email or a linkedin and offer to go and take them for a coffee and was amazing to see how many businesses pivoted during covid and are still continuing to pivot and there 's businesses that were more i have been busy than ever before and there 's businesses that unfortunately have been less busy have failed or have had some real challenges and but what i always recommend in that covered um conversation is looking at how else could you serve clients in your current business so is there a space within your business that you could and potentially still provide that same level of service a lot of people something really simple they took it online and then there 's a hotel and that that was on here and they asked one of the questions around covert and it 's looking then at now how do you get people excited about staycation how do you collaborate with other people in the area to offer maybe a dinner option so they could book a service for example we do this with the spa all the time we 're located underneath the beach hotel and so and we would offer a staycation so once all were closed we started offering um staycation so it was a night or two at the hotel we had breakfast over at swell over at the local cafe they had treatments with us and then they had an option for us to book them dinner and that could either be at the hotel they could do fish and chips and watch sunset and we recommended some walks we recommended the local yoga studio and those sorts of things and we brought all of that together now we did that we took all the money and then we paid all of the different all of the different different parties but especially within the city of june we 're looking at that small community i would look at potentially how could if your business has been really successful is there something that maybe you could help a less unfortunate business by collaborating with if you 've struggled during covert or you 're struggling on this outcome of jacobite how else could you uplift those services who else could you help by collaborating or is there something else within your remit that you have a look if you 've got questions again you 'll have my details at the end you 're more than welcome to send me a message about them okay so we talked about steps for success we talked about that sales process yeah and so in here this is the seven steps i 'm going to share with you today that i 've shared with you today and this is then in the process that i would look at them so qualify and ask open questions understand their needs and wants match your features and benefits to how your product or service can deliver that outcome for them remember what 's in it for me put yourself in their shoes every time you 're thinking about aligning a feature with a benefit whenever you 've got a question that 's been unanswered think about how would i answer it what else could i think of that i maybe could be sharing share a success story it makes it real it shows them that you understand exactly what it is that they are trying to achieve and that you 've the confidence in you to deliver that that product service or outcome get clear on your unique selling points this is what sets you apart from the rest include them in your key messaging make sure that everything aligns if they come onto your website does it look the same as when they call you over the phone if they pop into your office your social media does all of that streamline and that 's really what you can look at through that key messaging unique the new selling points and practice like i said in the beginning sales is that it is a skill you 're not going to get it today it 's not going to be perfect tomorrow but you 've just got to keep trying and so with some of the help that i hope i 've given you today and with that table as well you can go and do that yourself so one of the things i 've mentioned as well throughout it is that lead with service your wiring your passion and it will shine through and i 've had so many roles i was not necessarily that passionate about what i was selling and it was so so hard but what i was able to do was find something within that as to as to how i could be passionate about a specific service or outcome that i was selling and then i worked my way up and i found something that i was really passionate about and went on to there and then found something i was more passionate about and went on to there and and now that 's what i do every day and i and i you know and i really hope that i have shared some some valuable insights with you all and now i 'm going to jump into questions i 've just seen a few pop through there 's been one there 's a comment from cell okay we 're all welcome to have your event and we just checked that 's ems free business you 're looking to have your event and dining in saffron sabre we can book a

question that 's also come through so um from leah thank you leah as a trainer what would you suggest to be the most important thing to train or help someone build their confidence in selling as a beginner can you ask me that again what would you suggest to be the most important thing to train or to help someone with their confidence in selling as a beginner okay so inconfidence in sales takes a little bit of time and it comes from your passion and your knowledge of your product or service so what i would say if you 're trying to build your confidence and is that i would write out everything that i offer now i love journaling and it 's not for everybody but a lot of the time when i was trying to decide how i was going to offer my services and who i was going to offer it to i would journal out i would like to serve what my business will include what types of services and products i would offer and i wrote that out again and again and again and again and then from that i looked at who i could help and then from that i build my pitch now one of the services as part of this and of the competition so i 'd highly recommend that you pop that in there as well is and is putting there around your challenges for sales is building confidence because if you can if you can really articulate what your products and service does for your for your ideal target markets and you can really articulate your passion and your why that you created that business the confidence will come through from there when we 're generally less confident it 's because we don 't really know what we 're gonna say next we don 't really know what our processes are and we don 't really know how we can help that client and that 's not because we can 't it 's just because we 're just not would say to write out what it is that you 're offering write out how you help clients and then think about some of the problems or challenges that you can help them overcome and i would just say start testing that out with people now generally i find it 's harder to speak to somebody that i know than it is sorry i used to find it hard to speak somebody that i know when i was practicing and i used to have to do roleplay and i hated it and i did cold call roleplay and i did face-to-face role play and but it was the best thing that i ever did because it puts you out your comfort zone you 're talking about rubbish because you kind of it 's a fake scenario but if you 're happy to try it out with somebody and you want to test out with somebody then do it if you want to send me an email i 'll do a video call with you and you can practice your pitch with me and but realistically you want to be able doing who it is that you can help and then how it is that they can work with you and think about some of the people that you 've seen out there in the market that could have really benefited from a service like you and just start practicing everything we 've learned today make notes on build them out as processes have them as scripts have them as guidelines and then you 'll soon start to be able to work around those guidelines i hope that helps great um are there any other questions from from the group from the audience you 've been um it 's been interesting just to see the engagement um because i think there 's been some really good comments and some really productive questions that have come through and even the pre during the registration the comments that have come through are really really valid and um so that 's been really good um maybe i 'll give it a couple of minutes until we have any other questions um i do have another a couple of comments as well which i might when you were talking through the challenges i 'm like oh the city 's helping with this all the city has a partnership on this all right go for it when we 're talking about marketing we 've probably emphasized the business catalog a couple of times it 's a new it 's a new body of work but it is about really being able to pre create a free platform for our businesses to be able to market themselves you can go in at any point of time change your logo change your images change your content put up special offers this is your opportunity to do that and the outreach is that we 've got a partnership with journal uptimes we put out the first hundred listings we 'll be doing the next um 500 listings before um with doodle up charms and it will go out to every household that journal up times has rested and subscribed to there 's a paid social media campaign that 's going on um with with journal up times to promote the catalogue and we 're looking at how we can the craigie leisure center which attracts 1.6 million visitors into their center so can you imagine the footfall you would have if you promoted your products on the catalogue so it 's a really really fundamental piece of um platform where i think we 've sort of thought out of the box and thought about how we can promote businesses in our location so please use it to your advantage post those opportunities if you are looking for an architect if you are looking for the um for a local plumber if you are looking at those collaborative opportunities post that as a business opportunity you know one of the first sales we had one of our local hoteliers who actually put up a post saying they needed 10 000 worth of signage replacement and that was also then an outcome through the catalog so these are the opportunities that you can really leverage through that when you talk about you know how do i reach out how do i get new customers engage in networking we 've got a fairly solid business association here the journal of business association 's the executive officer reach out to them they run coffee connections every week i think every every alternative week but you know make that opportunity go and take that time how build those relationships relationships are really really key and um you know that that 's a really good way to network we have a business engagement program where as a team we can come out and meet you or you can come in and meet us and we can help you connect into other opportunities the spend campaigns that you were talking about harriet as well another great opportunity we 're another partner with destination perth so we have a partnership with that but you as a local business if you are a part of that destination offering you have an opportunity to get free membership between now and march and really promote what your campaign is so the the packaging that you 've talked about harriet is absolutely perfect those are the kind of things that destination perth can put out to about i think they 've got 2 million subscriptions so here is that opportunity you those connections um i have one more question that 's come in as well harriet from sal so how can we change the public willing to change their habit for consumption and buying of what they 're used to so i think that 's a bit of a mindset shift of the consumer that cell 's referring to and i 'm trying to think so with change the habit for consumption and buying what they 're used to so as in if they 've got if they 're buying something already too much is that about small business do you think i think it 's about the consumer i think it 's about you know um changing i think that 's about change behavior in consumers and trying new things i think that 's what sells okay trying new things and again that will come through your messaging and sal i know um because i as that was part of our our program earlier in the year and i actually went to his lovely cafe and for our wrap-up session but the um i think in that space is around as humans to keep doing the same thing we like routine and we feel comfortable in routine a lot of people don 't like change and and so really what we 're going to be looking for there is that why do we want them to change and what is it that that can what what is it that we can deliver or what and experience can we provide them that they 're gonna not that they 're gonna get through you and nowhere else and so i think a lot of that comes into key messaging unique selling points and and education and so they 're trying to avoiding trying new products so sorry so sal 's just updated that in there around the habit for consumption and they 're avoiding trying new products and but i think that will come into education because generally if you think about the matcha tea and hype and then the chai lattes and all these ones that have come through they 've become fashionable first and then we 've all started drinking them but then we drink them because we understand the i might not really know what that is but if i then understand that what those spices go into it what how those spices can help me have more energy that can boost my immune system so it 's like anything that we 're trying to get them to use like one of the treatments that we took a really long time trying to use a spa with the reflexology because no because a lot of people were really skeptical because it all had that really painful reflexology either in bali or at one of the um the smaller massage joints that were in the shopping centers and so was actually reflexology can bring you a lot of different benefits and so we use that as part of our key messaging around the stress reliever around that immune boosting around that space because it 's all about what 's what 's really in it for me like why should i come and have that how i should come and have a drink in your cafe why should i come and have that treatment why should i come to you for use you for these services it 's all around what benefit can you give back to the client and if you can clearly articulate that in your key messaging and advertising and um sharing that as people come in and not shoving it down their throats because again we 're looking at it from that quality and quantifying and then sharing those features and benefits think about it in that way but it comes down to education absolutely and i have to agree with you and i think so you do some great things in your cafe you know being able to provide some samples giving us a taste of some of the different unique offerings that you have there 's power in that and i think that takes time to have that change you know um but you 're right it 's it 's a change in behavior and education is the only way of bringing that to the forefront so yeah if no one has any more questions thank you harriet thank you thanks for having me it 's been great to have you on board and i and i really feel like there 's an opportunity where businesses um yourselves the participants who are here today you know here is your chance put in your application we 'd love to see uh what you 'd like to get out of this and being able to take your business to the next step and um that would be awesome so thank you harriet we 're going to have a fun competition running through between now so if you have any questions please ask harriet um send her an email send us an email from a city 's perspective if you want to know more about some of the different products that we have on offer more about the catalog more about any other business range products or further details we have probably a fun filled february that will be ending the competition but also we 're looking at our next round of business ready program so we 'll be out early in the year um promoting those to you um when it comes through so um this is probably the last sort of engagement piece that we have we all thank you for being a part of our network i think we 've had some great outcomes um my team we 've got beck we 've got william we 've got michael we 've got um narelle andrea who are all part of this team and we 've had some fun-filled times with you guys and really look forward to the coming year and continuing building this network and seeing more sales come through for the region great take care thank you good luck everybody thank you take care bye _"

    "text": "hi my name is mani and welcome to city of gender love libraries read learn grow series when we get to discover the magic of libraries if you 've ever been to the library you would see that we have many many books and today i 'm going to share one with you now there 's a very special event coming up that only happens once a year can you guess what that might be maybe some of these stories and decorations give you an idea did you say christmas yes so christmas is almost here that very exciting time of the year so the story i have chosen to read is called santa jaws now you can probably see here that there is a shark dressed in a santa suit now that 's something i would like to find out more more of so let 's get started so the story is by mark sparing and the pictures are drawn by sophie corrigan and the book is published by bloomsbury children 's books down beneath the ocean wave it 's almost christmas eve and a sneaky shark named shelly a santa hat from the deep sea christmas store then made herself a jolly sign to hang on her front door and the sign says welcome to santa 's grotto little fishes please come in and meet the real life santa claus it 's really really him now grotto is another word for cave in case you have not heard that one before now most fish know where shelley lives and think she 's full of tricks and after looking at that sign they swim off extra quick but one day through some tangled weeds a squid named sid passed by and when he read that jolly sign he gave a happy crime well i 've never hung a christmas stone or licked a candy cane and i 've never built a snowman which seems an awful shame but today is my lucky lucky day golly whiz and g for guess who 's meeting santa claus yes me yes me yes me so that excited squid named sid gave the driftwood door a knock and when it swished right open it gave him quite a shock come in said a swim a little closer i 've got presents in my sack presents squid little sid i 'm happy as a clan who 's going to meet santa claus i am i am i am but there in the darkness was all quite as it seemed when little said swam closer he gave a squid like scream why is your skin all gray and shiny and where are your fur chim boots said shelley with a ho ho ho i 'm in my diving suit but your teeth are sharp and pointy seat splattered in the dark you 're not the real santa claus you 're a great big sharp toothed shark oh no sid looks pretty scared sid kicked and flicked his tentacles too scared to stick around but as he swam to safety there came a sobbing sound i didn 't want to eat you called shelley through her tears all i really wanted was to spread some yuletide chia please please won 't you trust me i 'm truly not all bad will you help me give the ocean the best christmas that it 's had sid looked shrill will i trust you will i help you i will i will i will then all across the ocean the presence slowly drifted down through icy depths and seaweed groves right here to coral town mary fishmas bellowed shelley to the cheering crowds below while a squid named sid sang this song so everyone would know i 've never had a christmas star or licked a candy cane and i 've never built a snowman which seems like quite a shame and though i 've not met santa claus i 'm still a lucky squid for who just met santa jaws i did i did i did oh they 're having a great big hug there we go well i hope you enjoyed that story as much as i enjoyed reading it and i 'm so glad that shelley didn 't eat sid did you see some of the decorations that shelley had in her grotto i saw some tinsel and some stockings what sort of decorations do you have at home do you put up a christmas tree in australia we know that christmas is usually pretty hot in some parts of the world it 's winter during christmas and they even get snow so i 've decided to make a snowflake and all you need to make this one is a piece of paper and some scissors okay so for your piece of paper you just need to make sure it 's a square and a square is when all four sides are the same and if you want to make a big snowflake you start with a bigger square and if you would like to make a smaller snowflake then your square can be smaller so once you 've got this one you fold it to make a triangle and then you fold it again to make another triangle and because this paper is quite big i can even fold it again so once you have your triangle like that then what you do is you just cut some shapes out of each side so it doesn 't matter what shapes they are you can do anything you like so you can do little triangles squares little half circles so once you 've gone around all you have a snowflake so if you 'd like it to be a decoration to hang on your tree you can just add some string or ribbon like i did for this one and as you can see i made a smaller one here and i did slightly different shapes so no two snowflakes are going to be the same so a literacy tip for parents and caregivers reading to your children regularly exposes them to words that they don 't hear in everyday conversation so for example today we heard grotto in the story so this helps to widen their vocabulary so when it comes time for them to learn to read it 's going to make it a lot easier for them so if you enjoyed today 's story and you would like to hear more stories why not to come into one of our branches and attend a story time session i hope that i see you in the library soon thank you bye for now you _"

kangaroo as cousin penguin lipped from the billabong and land on the bank next to the other animals in the hot hot sun thanks for the visit it 's always good to see family at christmas but you should have told me so i could have got you a present don 't worry about presents said cousin penguin looking up to the sky i heard it very hot in australia the animals looked up to and saw a big square

sunset all day if he could watching the beautiful oranges and reds and yellows of the setting sun mixing in with the blues and purples of the night sky but sadly sunsets only happen once a day so henry had to find things to fill up his day harry tried many different hobbies he tried bird watching but the birds would fly away when they saw his big purple coat through the trees he tried tennis but he could not find anyone to play with the purple monster he tried rock collecting but the pretty boulders he found was still too heavy for a large monster like him so he gave that up as well all henry wanted to do was sit and look at the colours of the sunset one day on a walk through the forest henry spied a big colorful poster stuck to a tree come one come all to mr mortimer 's baking school hmm baking sod henry i do maybe i can learn to make them so off henry stomped stomp stomp stomp to mr mortimer 's baking school to see if a fluffy purple monster was even allowed to learn how

smelled delicious and sweet when henry arrived come in come in mr mortimer joviali welcome to my school put on an apron and help me with these macarons henry tied white apron around his tummy picked up a wooden spoon and nervously walked over to mr mortimer to see if he could help today my good monster we are making macarons macarons are sweet little dainty treats that come in all sorts of colors

federal and state advocacy a recognised tourism leader evan joined tourism council wa in may 2011 following five years at the tourism and transport forum as national policy director prior to that he was involved with the community and public sector union directing federal advocacy campaigns on immigration customs and quarantine issues ladies and gentlemen please welcome evan ladies and gentlemen some of you have submitted questions as part of the registration process and we will endeavor to deal with some of those this morning the first question i have is for the minister what are some of the initiatives and innovations that have come about in covert 19 period in your portfolio um which one which portfolio no i look at the tourism with respect to tourism obviously um the the big thing that we we had to do by necessity the agency focused on international and interstate visitor numbers and so in 2018 we had the biggest numbers of out-of-state visitors in history it was exceeded in 2019 19 and we were on track to exceed that again in 2020 we had to shift all of their effort towards interest state so western australians holidaying at home that has been incredibly effective and we 're seeing west australians holidaying in in their backyard like never before we are still confronting really serious challenges with the big city hotels in the middle of the city because 85 percent of their revenue is generated by interstate visitor you know normal business travels so what we have i can say and we have already had and have been rolling over is in market buy on the eastern seaboard to attract leisure travelers back but also business travelers and we 're working uh gareth and and kevin are here from business events perth we 're working with tourism council the aha business events perth and tourism wa obviously leading that effort to ensure that we are a very attractive destination for the very what we become a control boarder rather than a close board but we 've switched focus we 'll pivot back towards the what is available as it becomes available we 're ready for international when we can thank you amanda what are the flow-on effects of the expansion of the health campus for instance working holiday professionals and some of the partnerships you developed during the covert 19 period you well we do have it 's a 250 60 million dollar expansion so there 's a significant number of beds so the first thing is the jobs impact we have to staff this area so um out of the thousand that 's um been predicted um i think i 'm going to take out somewhere about 20 25 of that number and i 'm really proud of that that 's a great number how do i staff them um the young doctors they 're fantastic they 're irish they come here for an experience they come here to have fun they want the marina they want the beach they want the pubs they love the pubs up here and they they they will leave in western australia the rest they 'll leave in bali on the way home that 's okay but they will leave it somewhere but 80 of their salary will stay locally so we also have the visiting um uh visa nurses i call them they come on their travel they come for six months so they 're another group i 've really struggled without those staffing the irish are coming back they 've discovered ireland is still cold wet and uh and full of covert so they 're coming back so that 's great just in terms of the um the some of the challenges through covert um we 've had a little a few things we 'll be able to do but the one we 're really proud of and quest to hear as well we looked at maternity maternity patients were very very challenged private maternity were very challenged about coming to a hospital that was full of coverage so we did an arrangement with quest where they would get a short stay at quest for the uncomplicated ones um so it 's not been relationship with the quest people so thank you very much and we intend to continue that going forward i had was you know it was a bit of a trial it the feedback we got was fantastic so i think we as a community need to work together that we kind of share our business together and share what we can do so that 's been a great a great um program for us thank you very much amanda simon thinking of the international education and the visitor economy what role do you think business can play in attracting and connect students to the journal up region um i i think from the outset some of the remarks uh jason made about destination joondalup spoke to exactly those things that we focus on in education as well so when destination june up we 're looking at things like how do you encourage people to stay longer choose to return and invest thereafter it 's not a coincidence that for study perth the the tagline for wa and perth and of course joondalup is is live learn and launch so when reflect upon is that we we sometimes still point out that joondalup is is an easy commute when we should say that joondalup is a wonderful place to live if you 're a young person most international students who do come to australia they 're they 're looking to have a great education and joondalup and ecu work very closely on some of ecu 's uh premier programs but at the same time we always say to students that if you come and do the right program you can have a wonderful career in this part of the world so in in looking at what business and uh government and universities do together it 's it 's the live and the learn and the launch it 's live in joondalup don 't commute to joondalup participate in those premier programs that we offer but have a career here afterwards thanks tom evan um what role do you think visitor servicing can have in growing the visitor economy yeah visitor servicing 's uh absolutely critical there 's often a tendency and tourism to focus on the marketing uh which is a of federal state and local governments to get involved in destination marketing but the long-term success of any area depends on the offering from that area and that nine times out of ten comes down to what uh tourism businesses are offering guests be they leisure uh businesses hospitality uh so on and so forth so a big part of it is is the visitor uh service and certainly i think a critical issue for uh for joondalup is that there is the the destination lacks a point of arrival we have some great attractions that are quite um quite dispersed uh but really there 's no point of arrival no natural stop between say perth and cervantes and one of the things you should certainly be looking at is some sort of visitor servicing center uh it just gives that point of right where am i how do i know i 'm in joondalup you know as someone who 's never been here before where it is that i 'm going where do i turn up now it 's easy in destinations like sydney you know you turn up you know the destination but but where do i land uh where do i come in so certainly i think um a hub of some form we would certainly recommend uh established as an accredited visitor center that can provide that service to visitors so that they know they 've arrived the second part of that is to upsell the destination there 's a lot of marketing effort that goes into getting people here be it study perth bringing in the students or destination perth uh bringing in the uh the leisure visitor but once they 're here you have a marvelous opportunity the most effective marketing at all is to upsell to the destination to people who are already here and that 's the critical role of a visitor center or visitor servicing and it 's the same as if you go into a shop to buy a shirt and you walk out with a suit you ever had that experience is because you 've had an interaction with a human being who knows and loves the area who 's going to tell the story of the uh of front face that point of arrival and the ability to have that conversation one-on-one with the visitor who 's already made the decision to be here you can have that conversation and after that they will stay longer and they will spend more and we 've got good research to back that up tourism wa did an assessment of visitor centers a couple years ago and the average person who turned up to a visitor center spent i think dollars more in the destination than those who didn 't because they had that upsell experience and that 's the the key to visitor servicing that 's the number i like everyone 's going to spend 104 more you know that there 's a really good analytic there we 've got a slido question given many of western australians behaviour is relatively unchanged no masks social distancing are we ready for transmission i 'll pose it along the line but i 'll start with you minister oh yeah we um absolutely otherwise we if are you talking about in terms of the shift from east uh closed border to a controlled so yes otherwise um so the health advice from the chief health officer accommodates um you know the level of threat in other states and and would not have changed and would not have enabled us moving to a controlled border had he not been satisfied that we 're ready so that 's the first observation but i can tell you in terms of and i 'm sure you 'd be able to confirm this in terms of investment in you know we did spend we spent a lot of money and a lot of effort and a lot of work by uh people in the health system to ensure that we were ready uh in the in the event that there was widespread community transmission some months ago so that all of that effort has is has resulted in outcomes that are still there um we 've also you know we 've accrued significant uh additional capacity in terms of icu beds and ventilators and ppe you know there is there is uh in wa we have enough of a stockpile to give every single person a mask we that um were undertaken in those early days us you know have resulted in us being prepared the other thing to make you know to observe is that um on the eastern seaboard there 's been really great effort you know victoria had another zero today so um that 's six days in a row of no community transmission um looking like new south wales might be the worst state in the country um but they are very are deemed still low risk of trans of of um you know transmission or low risk of threat for us all of the others states and territories are deemed very low risk so um i i think yes we are i sit on the state disaster council confirmed that we wouldn 't have moved towards the controlled border had we not been convinced of that amanda this i know from our conversation the other day is an area that has special interest for you yes it does um i 'll say one thing about the west australian health department and minister roger cook i think the leadership with the um pandemic response and and uh and certainly i i believe um that we 've probably been better than most of the other states and it 's because we in west australia are able to run as a single system there 's a collaboration and a cohesion here that doesn 't exist anywhere else and i 've worked in victorian health department i think i 've got to say they 're fantastic and dan andrews is amazing but wa is better [Applause] and so it was a very very well organized well orchestrated response through the public system and the private system now i sit on both sides and so i 've seen the public response to the private response we will function as one system going ahead we are well equipped to manage uh an outbreak even a significant outbreak we are still well equipped and so really what we need to be saying to our communities is you need to get on with your life we can manage but please please do your part now roger assures me that western australia is a compliant now that is if you look at i think that when we say to people in western australia you do need to wear masks and i think that we will often need to wear masks and that we managed need to manage social distancing i 'm pretty confident that we 'll be reasonably compliant and in the areas where we get outbreaks which we will and i think we need to be just really calm about it we can respond really really appropriately in this state and i think that we 'll sail through this if we all stick the course we only need someone silly to do something silly and break the chain and then we 're struggling but everyone does what they 've always done we 'll be fine if someone does we 'll send them back to the state from where they came the biggest threat is international arrivals via air or sea that 's the real threat in terms of you know actual analysis of numbers and and likelihood of encounters with someone with the with covert not the interstate travelers but it is still out there and and we should assume that can i just take um to just looking ahead well part part what happened during covert and looking ahead can you share an example of some collaboration that you saw that boosted the resilience of of business and and how you see that playing out going forward yeah i think uh uh if i just take an example a lot of businesses have changed a lot of uh of what they do during the cover period and it 's sort of accelerated a pathway that business has been on what we 've really moved into is managing the nature of tourism is that it 's it 's a forward business it 's a futures market tourism is planned people plan their their journeys and for us fundamentally it 's all about bookings and reservations and being able to get uh our offering uh out to the rest of the world uh either through marketing campaigns or through uh through online distribution so what we 've seen is businesses really move into that um that system uh rapidly and it was certainly been a way to manage uh covert absolutely um if you 've got a booking before you get there you know what demand you 're going to get before the book is going to get there we 're about to go through a massive labor problem it 's it 's there in the regions at the moment we 're going to have it in uh in perth as well and one of the ways that businesses respond uh is by moving from the restaurant moves from walk-ins to uh to bookings in advance we 're seeing attractions moving into bookings in advance a move away from walking trade uh to uh to bookings and that gives you the information to manage your inventory to manage your staffing uh and to basically to manage the the guest guest as well so in terms of collaboration one of the best systems that we have is when we can take businesses collectively through that journey at a destination level and that 's something that we certainly focus on at tourism council when businesses want to step up into tourism markets they basically need to have to be instantly bookable to have their we find it it works best when we take a cohort of businesses through so we 've got a program called destination boost which we basically collect the best the best businesses in town and you move them all together such that you can create on an itinerary of at least an overnight stay i mean this is this is a day trip market i 've got to tell you what you need is an overnight stay that 's when you start to get the real uh the real value so you need uh two days worth of activities and accommodation to stay in when you can package all that up together where it 's all bookable uh and then it can go to market through tourism wa through destination perth be connected with um visiting friends and relatives for international students for example so uh working on that together that starts with training fact we 've got some training on here in joondalup on the on the 26th of november but fundamentally works best we 're not just doing as individual businesses but when you can get a cohort itinerary that you can really sell okay ladies and gentlemen i now need to bring the this session to a close could we have a round of applause please for the honourable minister and our [Applause] panel you _"

have been commissioned by the city to lead the development of this plan without stealing jason 's thunder as you all know global disruptions to travel resulting from covet 19 have exposed how much national and local economies do rely on visitors and the city of journal up is no exception in fact compared to western australia as a whole our city is more reliant on visitor related industries as a proposal to the local economy in the midst of the pandemic this plan has been a glimmer of hope for our local businesses to create and grow a thriving resilient visitor economy into the future thank

but they 're really important for building a child 's phonological awareness phonological awareness there 's some big words but all they mean is the ability to hear sounds in words and the best way to encourage this is through rhymes through songs and through stories and through books like dig dump what role which we just read which has lots of sounds in it that you can say and make books with animal sounds are also really good for phonological awareness because when childs can hear those small sounds and words they 're developing their pre-reading skills which is great hooray now talking

long this is the way we saw the wood strong and good strong and good this is the way we saw the wood all day long this is the way we hammer a nail hammer and nail hammer and nail this is the way we hammer a nail all day long this is the way we clean the glass nice and fast we clean the glass this is the way we clean the glass all day long yay we built a house then we 're singing another song about an animal building a house so we get our little fingers ready to do incy wincy spider incy wincy spider climbed up the water spout down came the rain washed pouring sea out out came the sun and dried up all the rain so incy wincy spider climbed up the spout again yay now i sang webs don 't they with their clever strong silk lots of animals build their own houses like birdies birdies buildings nests and beavers beavers build dams and piggies build houses yes they do and i 've got a story about some piggies who 've built some houses and i 'm gonna tell you right now so once upon a time there were one two three little pigs and they decided to get out on their own and build their own houses using some of their favorite materials first little pig built their house out of straw is he like yellow second little pig built his house out of sticks and wood because he like going into nature a lot and the third little pig was very clever she built her house out of bricks and there they were happy in their homes happy and safe until one day someone came a knockin it was the big bad wolf he was very hungry he went to the first pig 's house and he said little pig little pig let me come in the little pig knew not to let strange wolves of my chinny-chin-chin and the wolf said then i 'll huff and i 'll puff and i 'll blow your house in so the wolf took a big breath and he huffed and he puffed and he blew the house of straw away oh no oh that little pig ran to his mother 's house and he was safe in the house of sticks and wood for now but the wolf soon caught up with him and he was still very hungry so he knocked on the door and he said little pigs little pigs let me come in not by the hair on my chinny chin chin what did the wolf do big breath he laughed and he puffed and he blew the house in oh and the little pigs went a big bad wolf a big bad wolf and he comes up to the house of bricks by now he is very hungry and the little pigs are very scared because they know that he 's gonna try and blow that house in isn 't he he is he goes little pigs little pigs let me come in our chili chin cheese go away wolf we don 't want to be your dinner yeah go away but the wolf huffed and he puffed and he huffed and nothing was happening he tried puffing again he tried happening again but that house of breaks stayed where it was it was very strong no the wolf was no match for it so the little pig said oh big bad wolf you can 't come and eat us because we 're safe in our house with bricks and they all said oh no i 'm so hungry another pig said yeah but why do you have to eat us yeah why don 't you go to the shop and buy a hot chicken and they 'll say oh i never thought of that so he went to the shop bye bye thanks for the idea i 'll go buy a hot chicken and when he bought a hot chicken instead and the pigs they lived happily ever after they went back and they rebuilt their house of wood and they went back and they built his house of straw and they hungry he just went to the shop and bought a hot chicken the end so i hope you like that silly story i 'm sure you 've heard it before but it is a really fun one to tell and i like it because i like how the pigs each chose different things to build their houses and i think that you can try and build something with some different materials at home you can build a cubby house maybe with some boxes and blankets or maybe some cushions maybe you can build something with blocks maybe you can build a sand castle if you 've got a sandpit at home or if you can go play in the playground with some sand that sounds like fun so your challenge is to go and build something and think about the different materials that you 're building it with all right now i think that that is all the time we 've got for today but that 's alright cause we 'll see you again but we 're gonna sing our very last song now so i hope you can sing we 've had a lot of fun we 've sung a lot of rhymes and songs goodbye to everyone we wave goodbye like this we wave goodbye like this we clap our hands for all our friends we wave goodbye like this bye i 'll see you again bye bye _"

strong biceps one morning the explorer went snorkeling in the deep blue sea with his net in one hand he came across a gigantic squid which had large brown eyes eight arms and two tentacles the explorer was swimming so fast to catch the brown 't want the brown eyed squid to swim away so he used his big strong biceps and his net to catch the brown night squid finally the explorer found the brown eyed squid amongst the seaweed and the seahorse he swam very slowly towards the brown eyed squid and quickly snatched the net over him the explorer was so happy he bursted into joy and swam back

cracker and they sailed on until they came to an island covered in melted cheese so willy worm consulted the treasure map one more time and said i don 't think our treasure chest is here it polly

    "text": "hello my name is albert jacob and i 'm the mayor of the city of joondalup which is your local government area local government is one of the three forms of government that we have in australia in western australia there are 138 local governments sometimes they are also called shires or towns the federal government looks after all of australia and the state government looks after western australia and the local government looks after the suburbs in which we live many of the services and the places that you use every day are the responsibility of the city of joondalup and we 'll talk more about how the city looks after your community a little bit later in australia we have a form of government which is called democracy this means that everyone has the chance to vote for who they would like to represent them when the big decisions are being made it also means that everyone who can vote also has the chance to put their hand up and say that they themselves would like to stand for election [Music] i was elected by the people who i was elected in 2017 and my term of office will be finished in 2021 i hope you enjoy the learning journey you 're about to have from here and i look forward to seeing you back here very shortly hi my name 's christian i 'd like to talk to you about the difference between paid employees at the city of joondalup and the kinds of jobs they do and the elected members or councillors and what their role is in your community as the mayor said earlier there are many services that the city provides to the community in fact there 's more than 150 of them you may already know some of them now if you have a dog or a cat you would have registered it with the city of joondalup if your family 's built a house or you 've put in a pool they would have been in contact with the city libraries leisure centres like craigie and community halls are all run by the city of joondalup and the people who work in them are paid by the city rubbish pickups beaches parks and the youth centres are all looked after by people who work for the city of joondalup local government planners help decide where roads houses and shopping centres are going to go environmental officers make sure that the bush areas we have in the city are not only protected but are healthy there are about 600 employees who work for the city in jobs such as youth workers librarians lawn mower operators accountants architects builders and planners immunisation nurses festival and concert planners lifeguards health inspectors rangers and recreation officers they 're all working and making plans to make your community a great place to live many of them make recommendations or suggestions to the councillors about the decisions that councillors have to make sometimes people think that local government is responsible for schools hospitals electricity and water but these are looked after by the state or federal governments the other part of local government is the elected members or councillors you may have had some of them visit your school for a graduation or assembly the people who live in the city or who own a house or a to be their representatives to make decisions for them about their community the kinds of decisions they make might be about planning that is where someone can build units or shopping centres or about whether a particular park might get a new hall a playground or new lights or even a skate park they also decide on whether we will have two or three rubbish bins or if people have to pay to park in certain streets these decisions are important because it makes our community the kind of place in which we actually want to live in there are about 160 000 people who live in the city of joondalup and they live in 22 suburbs these suburbs are divided into wards if you look on the ward map you can see that some of the wards look bigger than others this is because they 're divided according to how many people live in each one so that each councillor has about the same number of people to represent there are six wards in the city and each ward has two councillors who are elected by the people who councillors the councillors are elected for four years in elections which are held in october everyone over 18 years and two lives in one of the suburbs of the city of joondalup can vote for the mayor and anyone who 's over 18 and lives in the city can stand for election as mayor or councillors voting is not compulsory in local government elections and in the city of joondalup voting is done mainly by post some councillors have other jobs and they 're also very busy with the work that they do for the council there are a lot of events to attend council meetings and they meet with people in the community to find out what sort of place they want to live in councillors they 're not paid for the work they do for the council but they do receive some equipment and fees for attending meetings the mayor however does receive a wage [Music] one of the most important meetings that the mayor and councils attend is the council meeting held right here in the council chambers this is the meeting where the decisions are made people who live here the meetings are held on the third tuesday of every month at 7 pm now anyone can attend a meeting and sit in the public gallery you can also listen to the meeting on a live stream if you can 't get to the meeting this is an important part of the democratic process it 's very important that the public can attend these meetings and that they 're also able to ask questions or make a statement about an issue at the beginning of the meeting before the decisions are made the meetings are very formal with the mayor presiding over or in charge of the meeting councillors have to listen to each other and cannot speak without the mayor 's permission this is to make sure that everyone has the chance to have their say there 's an agenda for each meeting which lists everything that 's going to be discussed it 's usually a very large document because it has all the information and recommendations that councillors need to make the decisions all the decisions that are made by the councillors in the the meeting it 's important to know that the counsellors don 't just come to these monthly council meetings and make decisions without a lot of thought and discussion beforehand meetings called briefing sessions and strategy sessions are held to make sure that they have all the information they need to make an informed decision they may also have talked to groups of people in the community about what their thoughts are about a particular issue when all the discussions have taken place it 's time to vote either yes or no for something to be changed in the community because there 's 12 councillors sometimes six will vote yes six or vote no the mayor has what 's called a casting vote and his vote will decide if it 's a yes or no but this doesn 't happen very often one of the important things that councillors vote on are local laws local laws only apply to the local area and are made to protect the people and the environment in the city some local laws in the city of joondalup deal with parking fences smoking on beaches local laws they can be fined state and federal laws are different and people can be jailed for breaking these laws as you can see there are a lot of services and places that the city of joondalup provides for its local community now some of you may be wondering where does the money come from to pay for these things that we see around us well the council has a special charge called rates some of the money also comes from the federal or state government or business sponsorship and some of the things you use in the city like craigie leisure centre or special events at the library well you pay for these and this also helps fund the service so why don 't we head into the chambers and ask the mayor a few questions [Music] may very nice to meet you first up how do i address you uh thanks christian uh the official title for the mayor of the city of joonlap is his worship or her worship so the title is your worship personally when i meet somebody i 'm happy if they address is the honourable my official title is the honourable albert jacob but that has nothing to do with the fact that i 'm mayor it 's because prior to becoming mayor i served as a cabinet minister in the state government for more than three years and if you serve for longer than three years as a cabinet minister uh the governor can bestow that title on you for life which is why i have that title as well i 'd use it if i have it well i 've never used the title before so i 'll ask you your worship tell us a bit more about what it 's like to be the mayor of the city of georgia it is an incredible privilege cydia journal up is one of the largest local governments in western australia 160 000 people for me personally it 's an area that i 've lived my whole life in gone to school in my wife grew up in the area as well so it 's like every day i get to wake up and work for the betterment of my community and a lot of demands on that because 160 000 people is a lot of people so it 's very busy but it 's a real privilege it 's what i like to call a grown-up job yes it sounds like it 's how busy does it get it ebbs and flows and there 's a lot of different parts to the role so there is a civic and ceremonial role when i dress up in the chain and usually a suit and we will hold official council meetings and i chair the council meetings where council makes its decisions equally i have a ceremonial role so if someone becomes a citizen and more than 40 percent of juvenile residents were born overseas it is usually the mayor who swears them in as a citizen and there is also a media role so the mayor is the spokesperson of the city so if the channel 7 news or the west australian newspaper or abc wants to chat to somebody about what 's happening at the city of journal up it 's my job to go on camera and explain what we you decide to run for the office for me it was a it 's been a 15-year process so uh i first got interested in council when i was in my early 20s and i ran for the journal up council in 2006 when i was 26 years old within a year of serving as a counsellor here at the city i thought you know what my goal is to become the mayor it still took me another 11 years from that point i served here as a councillor for three years then i was fortunate enough to be elected to the state parliament where i served for nearly nine years including four years as a minister so having spent 10 years of getting to know government at different tiers i did a couple of degrees in the times i went to university did further study i felt that i was probably at a good point to put my hand up to try and take the leadership role for my community and i was fortunate enough to be elected because remember the people who get to decide who the mayor win an election at the end of the day and i 'm very grateful that i 've had this opportunity what would you describe as the best part of the job citizenships are my favorite part of the job it 's when council makes decisions so if we 're making a planning decision about something in an area you often have one part of the community that really wants a new development and one part that 's really concerned about it so it can be adversarial or you know there can be a lot of opposing views but when you get to do citizenships and remember nearly half our community come from overseas it 's one of the happiest things that we do here in the chamber everybody wherever they 've come from in the world are usually just so grateful to be here in australia so excited to live their future lives out in this community and that is my favorite part of this job well it can 't_''_798.959 all be fun and games what would be the most challenging aspect of being the most challenging aspect is those community you know if you 're trying to build a new skate park in the suburb you 'll have a lot of people who want it and a lot of people who won 't and you have to make a decision to support one side or the other the side who you support will generally be very happy but decide who you don 't will not be and that 's a hard decision to make well it 's very obvious here that you 're wearing something that most people don 't get to wear tell us about this yes so this is the merrell chain for the city of joonla every merrell position in western australia has a chain which goes with it the chains record the names of the people who have been mares as you can see there 's only four names on this one because joondalup 's still quite a young council and the mayor of the city is the only person who can wear the chain i only wear this chain for three things i wear it to preside over official council meetings once a month that i wear it for is anzac day and remembrance day so there 's only four names on it at the moment in 100 years time is that chain gonna hang right down it may well one of the most famous chains in western australia is the chain for kalgoorlie so that 's well over 100 years old kalgoorlie was a booming city back in the 1800s very heavy chain as well because kalgoorlie is known for gold mining so the merrell chain in kalgoorlie is actually gold fortunately for me this one isn 't so it 's a lot lighter although the responsibility gets a bit heavy sometimes so kids you need strong shoulders for the responsibility and to wear the chain really appreciate meeting you thank you christian same [Music] many of you would have seen this logo and you know that it represents the city of joondalup but you know what it actually means well these leafy bits up the top they represent the natural environment like parks or the bushland and this grid formation down here represents the built environment like roads and buildings it was to represent an environment that 's in harmony in harmony between the natural and the built environments thanks for watching and we look forward to seeing you in the city of joondalup you _"

today 's literacy tip for parents is all about print awareness little people can learn all about words long before they start to learn how to read and words are everywhere you go so why don 't you point out signs that you see in your travels and talk about what they mean and that will really help to introduce little people to printed words before they begin reading now let 's start off our session with a song we 're going to start with open shut them have you got your open shut them fingers ready are we ready here we go open shut them open shut them give a little clap lap creep them creep them creep them creep them right up to your chin open wide your little mouth but do not let them in shake them shake them shake them shake them shake them just like this roll them roll them roll them roll them blow a little kiss good job everybody great singing so now it 's time for a story and the first story that i 'm going to read to you today is called once upon a small rhinoceros and it 's written by meg mckinley and illustrated by leila rudge so let 's see what happens with our small rhinoceros once there was a small rhinoceros who wanted to see the big world every day boats sailed past on the nearby river they bought smells and sights and sounds from far away lands and the small rhinoceros dreamed around her the other rhinoceroses wallowed in the mud and bathed in the sun they grazed on grass and they rubbed their horns against the trees they did all the things that rhinoceroses do from the muddy riverbank the small rhinoceros watched the boats and sighed don world a mud wallowing rhinoceros this one here snorted but this is the world we have mud and and grass and and trees we have everything a rhinoceros could possibly need yes said the small rhinoceros we do a grass-grazing rhinoceros shook his head you 're a rhinoceros you belong here he said yes said the small rhinoceros that 's true but still she dreamed and the river flowed on and the boats passed by until one day oh can you see what the small rhinoceros is doing it looks like she 's got a log and she 's made it into planks and she 's tying some reeds together and she 's hammering i wonder what she 's making shall we see let 's see oh a tree scratching rhinoceros frowned you 're a rhinoceros he said you can 't sail a boat yes said the small rhinoceros you 're right a sunbathing rhinoceros rolled his eyes you 're a rhinoceros you can 't row or steer or read a mat he said yes said the small rhinoceros i know hmm it looks like she made herself a boat boat on the riverbank all the mud wallowing grass-grazing tree-scratching sun-bathing rhinoceroses gathered in alarm come back they called it 's dangerous you 'll get lost perhaps said the small rhinoceros as she waved as she sailed around the bend out of sight can you see her she 's sailing round the bend out on the ocean the water was deep dazzling blue sea sprays stung the air and foam fist on the tops of the waves the small rhinoceros trailed a hoof into the water and tasted salt she stared dreamily down into the deep deep water during the day the fish flashed beside the boat and then sank far out of sight at night the stars floated on the ocean 's dark surface the small rhinoceros watched the water she let the waves rock her to sleep and she sailed on through the woolly wild of winter and the smooth sweep of summer to far away lands and beyond she saw mud and grass and trees she saw spectacular sights and surprising smells and sounds and more things than a rhinoceros could have ever imagined wow look at 's a dragon and a camel and a lady with a basket of oranges on her head so many fabulous things and when she had seen all that she could see she turned homeward and set her sail to catch the wind the other rhinoceroses were waiting just where she left them behind with their mud and their grass and their trees she told them about the things she 'd seen and smelled and heard wasn 't it strange they asked yes said the small rhinoceros and scary sometimes said the small rhinoceros that 's what we thought said the big rhinoceroses and they turned back to their mud and grass and trees but then a soft voice spoke up did you get lost oh many times said the small rhinoceros and was it wonderful oh yes said the small rhinoceros it was that 's what i thought said the even smaller rhinoceros and she dreamed and that 's the end of my story so what a lovely adventure the little rhinoceros had i wonder if the even smaller rhinoceros might go on an adventure as well what do you lots of interesting new places holidays are a lot of fun little rhino went on his trip in a boat and i 've got some little boats here i 've got one two three little boats so i thought we might sing a song about three little sailboats and you can join in with the actions with me if you like we 're going to need three little sailboat fingers and then need to do some waves with your wiggly hand just like this and then can you rock from side to side very good okay here we go three little boats went out one day over the waves and far away with the wind they began to rock and one little boat returns to the dock so now how many boats have we got let 's count and see we 've got one two two little boats are you ready to sing again two little boats went out one day over the waves and far away with the wind they began to rock and one little boat returned to the dock all the way down there so how many got one just one little boat are you ready to sing again here we go one little boat went out one day over the waves and far away with the wind they began to rock and one little boat returns to the dock so now we 've got no little boats on the waves and one two three little boats at the dock very good singing everybody give yourselves a clap that was fantastic so now it 's time for another story and the next story i 'm going to read to you today is called follow the track all the way back and it 's by timothy natman and ben mantle so let 's see what happens to the little train who follows the track okay today was a big day for little train he was going out on the track all by himself for the very first time little train felt nervous he chugger chuggered forward very carefully and he each other chuggered backwards very carefully the track felt slippery under his wheels hmm he wasn 't so sure don 't worry said mummy you can do it and he chugger chuggered along the track a little more slowly at first chugga chugga chugga and then a bit faster remember when it 's time to come home said mummy train no matter how far away you are just follow the track all the way back said mummy and daddy train together where we 'll be waiting here for you but little train was going really fast now and he hadn 't been listening properly yep he whistled as he went chugging out into the world chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chug the first thing he saw was a great green field oh it was so wide clickety-clack could i get any clap sang the little train as he went running through the field and when he got to the end the track led him on over a bridge and it was so high he could see all around him for miles and miles really tap radley tap rally tap sang the little train as he went rattling across the bridge and when he got to the other side the track led him on up little train had never been up so high before glumpy clip comedy clip glampity clip sang the little train as he went climbing up the mountain and when he got to the top the track led him on to a roaring rolling river the water was rushing and splashing so fast zippity zoom zippy zoom zippity zoom sang the little train as he went racing by the river but when the river reached the sea there was no track left [Applause] little train shivered come such a long way through a field across a bridge up a mountain and along a river all the way to the sea and no matter how hard the little train looked he couldn 't see the warm bright lights of home he was all alone at the edge of the world and it was getting dark he missed his mummy and daddy train what was he going to do and then he remembered when it 's time to come home said mummy train no matter how far you are of course cried little train so he took a deep breath and he chugger chugger that he was facing the right way and he followed the track zippity zoom zippity zoom along the river comedy clip clumpy clip up the mountain rally tap rally tap over the bridge clickity-clack clickety-clack through the field and all the way back home where his mummy and daddy were waiting for him little train they said and the very next day the little train was out on the slippy sliding track game all by himself in search of an even bigger adventure and that 's the end of my story so many wonderful places that the little train saw on his journey i 'm really glad that he followed the tracks home again though to see his mummy and daddy i think it might be time for us to take a trip how about we take a trip in our row boat we 're going to sing row row row your boat have you got your rowing oars ready are we ready here we go

books with nice big bright colors maybe books that have got a lift the flap in them to inspire you know somebody who wants to keep reading maybe ones that have got sounds on them you hit the buttons or maybe things with texture and feeling and you know you 're doing it right and i 'm sure you already are when your children want to read the same story over and over and over and that 's what ted bear likes he likes his story before he goes to sleep every single night sometimes when he wakes up we have to read it in the morning so let 's get started on our story and we are in the ocean deep

    "text": "so the story I 'm going to tell you now quite possibly could be one of the oldest stories in the world it is the ancient dream time story of the Southwest of Western Australia first heard this story from my father dr. Noll now who first heard this story from his uncle named Thomas uncle Thomas never used to use the modern-day terms of the dreaming of the dream time he used an ancient word he called this time the knitting and knitting meant very cold time as during this time the land was flat the land was featuring the sky said heavily pressed against the earth and it was the heavy sky that stopped reality from appearing but all of the beings that are present on this land today they were present fact during this time but back in the dream time absolutely everything was in its spirit form in a tree spruce there were animal spirits there were bird spirits there were people 's spirits even spirits of beings we don 't see on the land today were present but all of these beings knew that one would appear and everything would have its place and a purpose but the mother spirits thought about this the more they realized when everything does become real that need to be some kind of balance some kind of order but more importantly somebody would need to take on a very special role this role would be to care for absolutely everything else around them only one group stood out as able to care for everything and that of course was us the human but it was the tree spirits who first came to the people spirits and the dreaming and they said when everything does become real as trees will only ever grow in one particular place we can 't look after very much at all so we trees we want you people to look after us and in return we 'll give you absolutely everything we can our berries our fruit our branches our root systems our trunks whatever you need from us the trees you 're more than welcome to take there 's just one conditional message range and that is please do not take us the trees spirits heard this they said the same they said you could take our fur our meat our bones take whatever you need like those trees just don 't take us the animals too none of us left island and it was decided when everything became real Italy the humans would be the carers absolutely everything around them but as time went by there was one particular being that sat there in the darkness just listening to all of this he was one of the larger more powerful spirits throughout the darkness and the distance this giant being was listening to some petty arguing amongst some of the simple spirits arguing over what they 're going to look like where they 're going to be what they 're going to become he wanted to stop this argument and eventually he got to the point where he could no longer tolerate this arguing the giant being just slapped he used all of his energy and might in an effort to lift that heavy sky but he was nowhere near strong enough to lift the sky all the way up he was only only formless being could take shape off was that of a big matter of many bones and many muscles a giant snake a giant serpent was the first real being and in the language here that being is called Woggle a being he may have heard of as the rainbow serpent in the modern day and if you could imagine a giant snake materializing from the darkness all of the other spirits stood in all they now had a leader but everywhere this giant snake traveled everywhere they 're being moved around its body it pushed up dirt creating hills valleys and future rivers but following this giant serpent ever so closely were two human spirits and they were called Charnock which meant very tall one male one female and the spirit woman stood ever so tall with flowing long white hair running all the way down her back and as well for the giant serpent was crowding our river the Swan it was the spirit woman that noticed everything underneath that snake is real everything above is not and the burning question in her mind led by curiosity one happen if I put my foot under that snake stone and as soon as she trod on the ground her foot immediately became real she trod on the ground for the very first time but as she traveled north following the giant serpent her second footprint was like Gendler her first footprint during the depths of blackball reach in the Swan River and the spirit man in the story he began to show several other human qualities he became bored he became impatient the last glimpse you saw of him he was disappearing into the darkness to the south last seen by her collecting things from the land and eating them as he went she took no notice of that spirit man she continued to travel long but as she traveled more she too became distracted she began to notice but staring back at her from the darkness all around were lots of little pairs of blinking eyes curiosity got the better of her again she decided to collect one of these beings looking back at her and as she bought the being close to her face she could see collected from the land a small spirit child and that is when our greatest human quality of all came into play that is emotion due to emotion she could not put the child back she really wanted to keep it so she placed the spirit child she collected from the land in her long white hair the child held on and she traveled north collecting more upon more of these children hundreds upon thousands two stars but as time began to elude her she became obsessed with collecting these children she collected millions upon billions more putting him all in her long white hair as she first traveled north and then east away from her but she did reach a point to the east where she stopped and something triggered in her mind that maybe she was doing the wrong thing by collecting these children maybe they had some kind of purpose she needed to know what they were for so she was sent to ask the land itself this land we call Buju she said Buju what is the purpose of these children and the land simply told her a human child is born on this land the child will be born with one of these spirit children the spirit child with that person 's connection to the countryside where they belong an ancient totem system and even a connection to the spiritual world once the rather not to understand how that works so she knew she 'd made a huge mistake she had to put all the children back one day that become future generations of people but then something else triggered in her mind the last thought of that spirit man he was last seen collecting things from the land and eating them and as soon as she thought back to that moment she stopped right where she was when she realized the only thing he could have been eating were those children and realizing this she became so upset all she could do was stand there shaking and trembling and the old people say she transferred the trembling into the ground right where she stood this place I 'm speaking on is 130 kilometers east of Perth there 's a very small town out there called back somehow but note would one day become future generations of people so it 's from this point measuring where she decided to turn south and try and find and stop that spirit man from eating any more children and as she ran south she passed many more children she had not collected our word for child or children is kulonga the core language on the ground looked up they could see all the cool angers in her hair and they knew we have to get them back somehow it was the children on the ground that turned themselves into the spirit bird that represents children a bird we call call body in the language here which is the magpie today these giant Magpies flew up picking the children from her hair and dropping them back to the ground but as the child fell it went through the heavy sky it hit the land that it turned to stone not a small stone but a giant granite boulder a giant granite outcrop or a monolith the summit of all these and running south from that towns out of mercury is stone we call cutter Kitsch which is best known today as wave rock that giant surfing wave frozen in stone and this is where she stood right in the center of young island looking for that spirit man but could not see him anywhere the birds were still bombarding her and in one last effort she ran south to elude them but as she ran south many more children fell leaving the perang her ups and other associated stones behind but in this dazed and confused state with the birds bombarding her she ran straight back to wave rock she left on to that stone and as she jumped upwards she rose above the sky 's level and rising into that sky she realized two big mistakes have now been made mistake number one she trapped herself above the skies level she could no longer connect back to the earth but even worse than that and no fault of their own all of the children in her long white hair were now trapped in that sky as well she promised those children somehow someway she 'll write the wrong and belong but in the meantime she teaches them all they need to know about living on this land while they 're up in the sky with her but of course much time has now passed this planet has been real for millions if not billions of years everything 's living everything 's evolving but as humans today we 're going against the ancient rules of living here we 're destroying our own environment but we the people of the south when we turn to those stars at night there 's a long white mass that runs through our southern sky we all call the Milky Way we call that Milky Way gender because John DeLong white-haired it 's all you can see of her the children she collect are all about itll stars up in the Milky Way but every now and then as promised she does send them back and if we 're lucky enough to see a shooting star at night or a meteor the our people would always say the words Y Canyon and why Galina means spirit child returning back to the air for those that the Milky Way is high in the sky at night and the moon is shining you can even see her walking onto that water it 's a beautiful little story but that 's a very short version and what is a very long story _"

    "text": "[Music] the mission australia 2019 youth survey identified physical health to be a personal concern for young people aged 15 to 19. physical health is such a broad topic one that we cannot cover completely in this video however today we will talk briefly about illness pain rehabilitation and sleep and then talk about creating a playlist for exercise so to start with music can be really effective in supporting physical health in a number of ways both receptively or listening to music and actively or making music a lot of music therapists work in hospital settings supporting patients through illness music can help with coping with a hospitalization coping with an illness strengthening relationships during this turbulent time increasing oxygen levels and decreasing stress and anxiety and all of this can contribute to a shorter stay at the hospital music can also help with pain especially actively singing it can improve blood oxygen levels lower blood pressure reduce heart rate and relax muscle tension while also diverting attention away from the pain [Music] when engaging with a registered music therapist rehabilitation patients can see great improvements in speech language as the neural pathways used and formed when engaging in music as well as the music acting as a motivator music can really help some people with sleep problems too with the physiological effects such as decreased heart rate relaxed muscle tension decreased cortisol and adrenaline levels and increased serotonin levels and serotonin is a precursor to melatonin the sleep hormone but let 's talk about music and exercise most of us have playlists dedicated to exercise and a quick search of spotify shows hundreds of exercise playlists a lot of them organized by tempo music can improve endurance and performance and is a great motivator so it makes sense that most of us exercise with music these playlists with specific tempos are often really great because we were naturally entrained to the beat meaning we will unconsciously move in time with the beat which always feels more rewarding and when this happens we can run faster and work harder and for longer runners are often not only able to run faster when they 're listening to music they have more motivation and show a greater endurance listening to music you might be working harder but it doesn 't seem like you 're putting in more effort because your attention is diverted through the music you might be less likely to notice the signs of exertion such as increased respiration sweating and muscle soreness some researchers say that all of these effects are more profound in cases of low to moderate intensity exercise so some people might find music to be more useful for a repetitive job rather than a quick sprint but again everybody is different some people might find that one short song is the perfect accompaniment to a quick sprint but we know that music has not only physiological effects but also psychological and emotional effects so an exercise playlist could help to stimulate and inspire you before a workout that 's mostly how i use music during exercise i don 't often enjoy working out with music but i will use a playlist to motivate and inspire me to exercise let 's say that you want to go for a run and you want a playlist to help push you to run a longer distance than your exercise playlist is to follow what we call an energy curve so you could start with a couple of songs that are a little lower in intensity and tempo for the start of your run then you could slowly build up the tempo intensity instrumentation style or a number of other aspects to help you to run a bit faster push a bit harder and have a bit more endurance [Music] you can slowly start to bring the playlist back down at the end to slowly wind down your run until you 're ready to cool down looking at my running playlist in the early stages i have titanium by david ghetto and sia this song is energetic but not too fast so it really helps ease me into my workout in the middle section of my playlist you 'll find the middle by jimmy world which has a faster tempo there 's also one of my favorite songs which adds to the motivation finally as i start to wind down you 'll find move along by the all-american rejects which is the perfect tempo for me to start like this can help you to reach your running goals as you will entrain to it without even realizing and hopefully be able to achieve some of the physiological and psychological effects we spoke about earlier one thing to mention is that while these physiological effects can and do make a difference in your exercise playlist researchers have found that a lot of the time people 's preferred music will be more motivating and therefore more effective than music that ticks a bunch of boxes such as ideal tempo but that you don 't enjoy so when you 're having a go at creating this playlist have a think about what would be important for you would you prefer to have only music that you enjoy regardless of the musical qualities or would you like to mix it up and include some of the techniques that we spoke about today _"

octopus have you seen my dog said jerry the starfish no i haven 't seen your dog all i 've seen is this green ball that splashed me in the face oh said jerry the starfish where could he be submarine submarine here boy he called all of a sudden the ball sputtered spinning and spinning and spinning and poof it turned into a dog the dog wiggled and wriggled and lunged forward but he was quickly tugged backwards his foe was stuck to the tentacles don 't worry mr octopus i 'll save you said jerry the starfish and flexing his bicep muscles reached submarine yelped and held and licked the octopus 's face and flexing his biceps jerry pulled and tugged and heaved but the first still wouldn 't come off the tentacles stop shouted fred i know how to get unstuck then he wriggled and jiggled and started to shake he shook his whole body from the tip of his head to the end of his tentacles and closed his eyes really tight and squeezed squeezed squeezed out shot a little bit of ink the sucker at the anna fred 's tentacle flew open releasing the fluff submarine was so happy that you ran to jerry and started barking thanks so much for finding my dog mr octopus said jerry and clipping a lead onto the submarine 's collar they ran off down the beach the end wow wasn 't that a silly scaly story and perfect for national science week if anyone else would like to write a story using the

    "text": "[Music] the mission australia 2019 youth survey identified mental health to be of personal concern to young people aged 15 to 19. almost everyone has used music to cope with challenging emotions and moods at some point in their lives many young people who struggle with their mental health talk about finding solace and meaning through music music can make us feel accepted and heard can express what words can 't and can even provide a sense of community and belonging with others however a lot of the time people are unaware of the impact music might be having while they may choose music that they feel is appropriate at the time more often than not these choices actually intensify negative emotions studies have shown that young people with mental health difficulties who rely on music to feel better simultaneously use it unconsciously to intensify unhappy states we know how powerful music is but it goes both ways it can be great at lifting your mood and encouraging personal insight and self-development but it can also hold you in a self-destructive pattern of rumination when we have a prolonged fixation just about changing the song contrary to popular belief it 's not the song choices themselves that are harmful it 's the way we choose to engage with these choices for instance a lot of people believe that listening to heavy metal leads to poor mental health and violent behaviors but researchers have shown that thoughts and behaviors are influenced by the choices we make in the music not the music itself healthy music listening starts with critical thinking about the ways in which we use music the when the how and the why think about how the music you like makes you feel think about when you choose to listen to it and think about why you choose to listen to it try and make active choices to use music to enhance your well-being rather than to amplify negative thoughts feelings and behaviors you may have heard of reframing where we identify thoughts behaviors or memories and then work towards changing the way that we view them this is a really good technique to explore especially if you 're finding that your favorite music is bringing about negative thoughts burying these difficult thoughts it would be a healthier choice to work out where they are coming from and work towards shifting these thoughts into a more positive life but this isn 't a task that can happen overnight it 's something that takes hard intentional work an example for me is the song i 'm not okay by my chemical romance when i was younger this song was the soundtrack to my rumination cycles blasting this song and wondering if everyone hated me if i was good enough if i was ever gonna have the life that i wanted things like that but after a lot of self work and insight and a lot of reframing of negative thoughts i now experience such joy when i listen to that song and it honestly fills me with so many feelings of accomplishment and success instead of the old feelings of loneliness and dread listening to this song allows me to acknowledge my younger self and validate those feelings that i experienced and be thankful for them as they made me who i am today instead of dwelling on these thoughts a signal telling me that my needs weren 't being met and using them to work out what i needed to do within myself to be happier but it 's hard to recognize and acknowledge how we are feeling a lot of the time it can often be very confronting to think about the ways that we use music and it 's a lot easier to just continue our listening habits without change but if you use it intentionally music can be really effective at gradually encouraging change for instance if you think you 'd find it hard to reframe your thoughts and behaviours towards certain music or you 'd find it too difficult to find a whole playlist of music that makes you feel good you could try using a gradual change through your playlist you could begin with music that matches where you 're at something that reflects and acknowledges how you 're feeling and then form your playlist from there slowly building to songs that will promote positive states of mind an empowering song that i might include towards the end of my playlist is lanterns by some of the difficult thoughts i might have experienced at the beginning of the playlist and help me to consider them in a more positive light this is also a good way to practice reframing sitting with and acknowledging your negative thoughts and using the music to help you understand and work through them it 's not always about making the negative thoughts go away it 's about understanding why they 're there and working with ourselves to rework these thoughts and creating a playlist like this could help with that if you 're thinking that all of this just sounds too daunting perhaps you could try creating a playlist for someone else creating a playlist for a friend a partner or a family member could be a great way of beginning to engage in this topic you could use it as a communication tool to give someone some insight into how you 're feeling when words are too hard or you could use it to help yourself understand their point of view and continue to build your interpersonal and empathy skills which would then support your own self-development don are really heavy topics and most people will need some guidance especially when exploring them for the first time talking with a consenting friend is sometimes really helpful but don 't hesitate to take advantage of the many support services your community has to offer you sometimes just having that extra person to talk to and support you can make all the difference [Music] _"

    "text": "the mission australia 2019 youth survey identified school and study problems to be of personal concern for young people aged 15 to 19. studying while listening to music is such a personal preference that most people seem to either love or hate today i will share with you some information about why music might be an effective study tool and also why it could be a hindrance and then we will talk about how you could incorporate intentional playlists into your study space and routine in both scenarios many of you probably already have a preference when it comes to music and studying i know people who like to listen to music they know really well people who can only listen to music they haven 't heard before people who can only listen to one specific genre people who need lyrics people who can 't stand lyrics and people who can 't study to music at all but for every personal preference there 's somebody out there with the opposite preference while some people can only study in silence others get too distracted by the various background noises and use at hand some people can only study to music they know really well as they don 't direct much attention to it but some people get too caught up in the personal associations they hold with that music and lose focus on their work for me when i was in uni i usually didn 't study with music playing i often found myself getting too caught up in analyzing the music and lyrics and losing focus on my work however if i went to study at the library where there were hundreds of other students all making noise i would have a short playlist to help draw my focus into what i was doing i would put on the playlist and sit with the intent of studying and that short exercise would help to drown out all of the other distractions until it was just me and my laptop and then i would turn the music off an example of a song that i used is the sound of silence by simon and garfunkel for me when i put on this song the world around me just disappears and it super effective in guiding my focus in that noisy library setting that 's one aspect of music that makes it a pretty cool tool to help with studying school work there are benefits to cognitive performance which we 'll go through but there are also benefits to emotional and psychological states which are equally as important when studying while music may help with memory and learning it can also relax motivate redirect and be an effective trigger for the frame of mind needed to study here are some ways that music can be a great study tool to help with cognitive performance firstly music activates all the different areas of the brain which can increase your capacity for memory and maximize your learning so for some people background music may help their brains to store information in their long-term memory music can also serve as a memory trigger as the brain likes to associate different sensory elements together you may have heard study techniques to do with colors where if you use different colors to study different things in an exam that color recall can help you to remember the instance if you had a specific study playlist that you always listen to while you study if you sing the songs to yourself in an exam it could help you to remember the information you associated with it now here 's an actual study technique involving music as we know music is great for memory and recall have you ever been in a situation where a song has come on and you haven 't heard it since you were maybe 10 years old and yet you still remember every word that 's because melody and rhythm are processed and stored in different areas of the brain than language that 's why people with dementia may not recognize their family members but they can sink through a whole album of music also our brain stores information best if we organize or transform it if you have a block of information you need to remember try turning it into a song an easy way of doing this is to substitute the lyrics from a catchy song with your own lyrics you could even record it with the voice members on your phone and create a playlist entirely out of your own study material it 's a really effective way of information recall but sometimes listening to music can be detrimental to your studying like we spoke about earlier some people find it hard to concentrate on the task at hand if they 're distracted by the music if it has lyrics if it 's too catchy and so on some people like to practice their exam in the same way as if they were sitting the actual exam and there 's no music in the exam room it also depends on what you were studying some people are fine listening to music when revising but can 't listen to music if they 're learning something new some people find it okay to listen to music when studying something like maths but have to turn it off when they need to use words like writing an essay i think it 's again important to talk about the intent behind the music listening and to think about what you want to get out of what it has to offer try setting an intention and music to help you let 's say focus you 'll most likely have more benefit than if you simply put on some background music and hope that it helps you in some way think about your personal preferences what kind of music would be best for you and when and you could even try a little experiment where you try studying with music and then the next day try without and see where you felt more productive more focused and more motivated if you do struggle with listening to music while studying you can still incorporate music into your study routine you should still try and find ways of using the benefits it brings such as that increased dopamine and focus when you play music and your brain releases dopamine it can improve your attention span and motivation levels but it doesn 't necessarily have to be the same time as studying instead of making a playlist to study too perhaps try creating a playlist to get you into the study headspace like i spoke about earlier or if you 're experiencing a writer 's block or procrastinating too much music you can also use music as a reward for after you have completed what needs to be done so when you sit down to create your playlist have a think about the intent of your playlist when are you going to use it and why have i think about what songs you want to put in it and think about how you usually react to them how they influence your emotions your mood your mindset and have a think about how you will go studying to them [Music] _"

used last time 's three weekly words of sprint crack and teapot once there was a pirate could oh mr jolly rogers who was always hunting for some treasure he heard there was some at the bear cave and sprinted there quietly so he wouldn 't wake the bear who is sleeping in the cave he found the treasure box and he was so excited that he accidentally cracked it open treasure no all he found was just a teapot the bear woke up and asked him hello would you like to have some tea with me the end what a great story joel you should be so proud of yourself now if anyone else wants to write the story using three weekly words send them through to us and we 'll be happy to read them on the show looks like our hat settled down during that story but now they 've started changing again i know darren they 're being very naughty today why don 't we tell another story and maybe they 'll be good story hat so you can draw this times three weekly words actually the magical story hat is already here oi get down you so we can draw the three weekly words and to help me draw this episode 's three weekly words is kevin the crocodile hello kevin are you ready to help me draw the three weekly words here thank you kevin this episode 's three weekly words are pear laugh bicycle well that first word is very interesting we actually have two words that are pronounced as pear yet they 're spelled differently we have pear and pear the top pair means two of something like a pair of shoes and the other pair means pear like the fruit so the word we 'll be using our story is the first one pear as in a pair of shoes and now for the story once upon a time there 's a boy called christopher with a little sister named katie christopher and katie were not ordinary children they were giants but not the kind of giant that would grind your bones to make their bread they were friendly ride a bicycle but there were no bicycles big enough in giant land for them to ride one day when christopher and katie were taking the morning stroll around the tall wall that surrounded giant land they had a sound of laughter coming from the other side as the wall was very tall katie needed to climb up on christopher 's shoulders so that she could see over the wall and what do you think she saw there were children riding bicycles of all sorts of sizes and colours there were people riding little yellow unicycles with only one wheel and big blue tandem bicycles that had enough space for five people to ride it at once katie was so excited that she reached out and picked up a red tricycle and squealed with delight oh look christopher a little red tricycle said katie dangling down the tricycle for a brother to see i wish we had a bicycle to ride mourn christopher can we help piped up a little voice on the other side of the wall and turning back katie could see all the children looking up at 'm sure he can make a bicycle fit for a giant set the little girl now engineers are very smart people who helped design and build mechanical things the little girl ran off and brought her father back who was very tall and had a long white beard the engineer had a ladder that unfolded till it reached the top of the wall and then he took out a really really really really really long measuring tape to see how big the bicycles had to be next he went back to his workshop and begin to build the big bicycles he used flashy tractor tyres for wheels comfy sofas for a seat and a lamppost for handlebars but most importantly an all-fire alarm that went ding-a-ling-a-ling for the bicycle belt it took all of the children to help push the bicycles back up to the wall and lift them up over into giant land when katie saw her brand new bicycle she squealed with glee wee a new bicycle just what i always

everyone so this week 's literacy tip for parents is all about sounds singing songs and saying rhymes together with little people helps them to hear the small sounds in words which is really important for when they 're learning how to read and today i 'm going to be reading some rhyming stories that are full of sounds so let 's start our session with a song let 's start with open shut them have you got your open shut them fingers ready are we ready here we go open shut them open shut them give a little clap open shut them open shut them lay them in your lap creep your chin open wide your little mouth but do not let them in shake them shake them shake them shake them shake them just like this roll them roll them roll them roll them blow a little kiss good job everybody that was fantastic singing well done so now it 's time for a story and the first story that i 'm going to read you today is called rusty the squeaky robot and it 's by neil clark okay far far away on planet robotone rusty the robot felt sad and alone with every nod of his head and tap of his feet he didn 't much like the way he went squeak he squeaked in the daytime and he squeaked through the night he squeaked so much it gave him a fright if he couldn 't like his squeak then he couldn 't like himself if only on planet robotone there were robots who could help ding bell wheeled over she was cheery and bright can you see belle don 't worry rusty she said i 'll make it all right there 's no need to be sad me let 's see what 's round the bend she said so off they went with a ding and a squeak i wonder who else rusty might meet next they heard a hog hoot had fun with his sound don 't worry rusty he said there 's no need to feel down let 's all loosen up and have fun and play enjoy yourself rusty it 's much better that way so off they all went with a honk ding and a squeak let 's see who else rusty will meet i wonder who else they 'll meet [Music] announced twango he was ever so smart don 't worry rusty he said there 's no need to lose heart we all have funny sounds but if we add them together we can make brand new sounds it 's really rather clever so off they all went with a twang hawk ding and a squeak rusty couldn 't wait to see who else they would meet but a boom interrupted the noise shook the ground look here it 's boombot he likes to play loud boom boom boom he said boombot robots moved around and tapped their feet soon they were dancing and rusty was too their sounds mixed together and made a great robot tune boom boom hog rusty said i 'm no longer worried about a thing it 's okay to be different it 's okay to be me my sound makes me special and that 's how it all should be and so with a nod and a tap and a skip and a leap rusty said now i love the way i go squeak and that 's the end of the story what a lot of different sounds all those robots made and when they put all their sounds together it made some really lovely music i 've got lots of different instruments with me here today and i thought we might have a bit of a guessing game we 're going to listen to some sounds we 're going to see if we can identify which instrument the sound belongs to so have you got your listening ears ready let 's put your listening ears on and we 're going to hear the first sound see be here we go wow that was a lovely sound that was a really kind of a strumming sound it sounded like strings being strummed i wonder which instrument has strings can you see an instrument here that 's got strings hmm i don 't think this one has strings and i can 't see any strings here oh this one 's got strings do you think it might be this one shall we play it and see let 's have a little listen see if we can do the same sound we ready it was a strumming sound just like this one so this instrument is a ukulele and that 's the sound that we were listening to so that 's fantastic good guessing everybody let 's see if we can hear the next sound and see which one we think that is have you got your listening ears ready here we go that was a crashing sound that was kind of a metal crashing sound can you see an instrument here that you think might make a crashing sound hmm i wonder which one it could be something do you think it might be this one shall we play it and see are you ready wow it was that one it 's the symbol the symbol makes a crashing sound that was very good guessing okay so we 're ready for one more sound here we go put your listening ears on here we go [Music] wow that was a banging sound i liked that one can you see an instrument here that might

more sound for you to listen to today so let 's see if we can hear what this one is you got your listening ears ready here we go oh that was a lovely jingling sound hmm what do you think might make a jingling sound a jingling jangling kind of a sound it 's not going to be the drum and it 's not the ukulele and we know it see what else have i got oh i wonder if maybe it 's the bells very good

    "text": "[Music] we 've all heard of the fight-or-flight instinct when we are faced with a physical threat or emergency our nervous system takes over and helps us to get through it but the nervous system isn 't that great at distinguishing between emotional and physical threats so when we are under emotional pressure our bodies respond in the same way as if it were a physical threat equaling stress this stress while useful in many situations can have some debilitating side effects and more often than not we are blissfully unaware that we are actually stressed additionally the more our stress system is activated the easier it becomes the trigger and the harder it becomes to turn off when we are stressed our nervous system releases stress hormones such as adrenaline and cortisol which tell the body it 's time for emergency action it also depletes our dopamine and serotonin levels our hearts beat faster our muscles tighten our blood pressure rises and our breathing it 's faster and shallower these physiological changes make our senses stronger and they increase our strength and stamina which is often useful in an deadlines but constantly being stress can cause or even worsen things such as mental health sleep digestive and memory problems pain and a weakened immune system among many other things there are so many reasons that we get stressed external reasons such as school or work problems and internal reasons such as an uncontrollable worry and pessimistic thoughts a loss of control and uncertainty surrounding the future are all things that can make us very stressed it 's hard for many of us to accept uncertainty and control is a psychological and biological human need music has heaps of regulatory effects on the body it has unconscious physiological effects where we might find ourselves breathing and moving time with the music and it has psychological effects through the emotional associations that are preferred music brings some research even shows that with that external steady cue for our bodies and brains to recognize and respond to our hearts may even be in time with the right music these effects can be through both receptively listening to music or actively singing and playing along engaging in music can decrease the gentleman and help us to regulate our breathing which can lower our heart rate and blood pressure and release physical tension studies have shown that an ideal rate of controlled breathing is six breaths per minute so if you were to choose a song with around either 48 or 96 beats per minute and breathe in time with the song you would be close to six breaths per minute an example of this is Queens wheeler champions which sits to around ninety four beats per minute if you were to breathe in with the other champions and then out my friends with that regulating pattern can help to reduce stress while all of these elements are we spoken about can have an effect on our stress levels the best thing about music is the opportunities for well-being it brings about based on intent and context studies show that our music choices are a reflection of our identity and that personal and meaningful associations to the music often have a greater impact than the musical elements I think a really important point to stress here is the intent of the listening as well you can just click shuffle and then your stress is magically cured but if you intend to use the advantages at engaging in music kunafa in a thoughtful and considerate way it can often have a great impact something else to keep in mind is that sometimes we want to listen to music to change our mood for instance we might choose to listen to something that calms us when we 're feeling stressed however sometimes we prefer to listen to music that matches our current mood to reflect and acknowledge how we are feeling researchers refer to a process called emotional contagion we often mimic the emotional expression that you perceive in the music when you are choosing music try and keep in mind the reason for choosing it and the needs you have at that moment if you do find yourself constantly listen to music that reflects a current mood you could try curating a playlist so you begin with music that matches and acknowledges your current state but then slowly evolves until you reach a desired a personal state for instance if I was feeling really down around the room would be really good for me but I just couldn 't muster the motivation I might create a playlist that begins with some slow and sad music but gradually gets more upbeat until I 'm finding myself dancing along without even realizing just don 't forget about the intent behind the choices it 's so important you _"

    "text": "now that your personal profile has been set up the next step is to add your business so that appears on the business listing i 'll demonstrate how to do this from the portal click on my business then scroll down and click on create is sort of by entering your business name you can also link your business to a parent account in other words let 's say for example you have many different sites all under one holding company you 'd want to list each business separately so that the address information is specific to that site or address in this demonstration i 'm not going to do that next the primary contact this would be automatically your name if you want to tie this to a different primary contact you could simply clear it out and then change the primary contact for this account you 'd enter the position or the job title for the primary contact next your australian business number and then click on the lookup to add an industry in my case i 'm going to put in acc short for accommodation and then click on select next you 'd want to add a short story about your business right so when somebody is viewing your business they will read a blurb which gives a little story about your business next a short story about what type of customers you 're looking for and then your address so the address is quite important because when the user is viewing your business site they will also see a map and that map is directly connected to google maps so for example if the user clicks on the map they can immediately click to navigate so we want to make sure the address information that is completed here is as accurate as possible let 's enter the postal code and finally the country and then just click on done next your email address now this email address is different from your profile so your profile email address is associated with your login and your personal profile this is the this email address is essentially going to be the public facing email address so you might want to be your customer service email address or your queries business profile this is the email address they 're going to direct queries to so i 'll just use admin as a sample and then your website address so you 'll notice that again just like your email address you have a separate website address for each company profile and the reason for that is is that in some instances some companies have separate website addresses that are specific to a site so you have an opportunity to enter a different website address each time next you can enter your facebook youtube linkedin twitter and instagram links so that when users viewing your purse your company profile they can click on the link and go directly to your facebook page for example next with some additional information you can choose your options in other words you want us to promote your business yes or no do want to connect with other businesses yes or no access to market opportunities and then subscribe to the newsletter you can choose the user option finally to confirm you 're not a robot you 'll need to enter the details represented in the picture can either click on generate new image or alternatively you can click on play audio which will essentially play the characters out for you so i 'm going to go ahead and enter the the characters that i see here and then click on submit if there are any errors you 'll see the error message represented here what actually is the issue and in this case i entered the picture code incorrectly so let 's go ahead and try that again i know the difference between o 's and zeros is sometimes a little bit challenging so let 's go and generate a new picture message and there we go this one i prefer there we go and then click on submit then on success you 'll notice your business will be directed to your business listing so we 're not finished yet so what we need to do is we need to add some additional details so click on the business name to open the business and we want to add things like trading hours for example uh you possibly want to add some pictures so let 's picture actually for the picture is when somebody 's viewing your company profile they 'll see a placeholder picture which could be a picture of the venue it could be a picture of of a special offer it could be any picture and you could put multiple pictures if you like and when the user views your business profile these pictures will display in the carousel type format so for demonstration purposes i 'll just add one picture for now and then click on add note then you 'll notice if you look at the map your addresses has already been configured and then we want to add maybe some additional details about your business if you want to add another branch you can add a separate branch over here and then you can also add things like trading hours so i 'll add one line of trading hours so let 's say for monday we 're going to open at let 's say let 's say 8 am let 's choose 8 am and then closing time let 's go for 5 p.m right there we go and then enter individually one at a time and then you can manage them and update them as as you see fit by clicking on the drop down and going to view details and then allowing you to edit once you 're satisfied with the changes that you made you simply click on submit at this stage although your business has been added to your profile it actually isn 't approved yet and it hasn 't actually been added to the business listing you 'll notice once your business has been created that you would receive a confirmation email telling you that your business is under review once the contents of your business has been successfully uh or has successfully passed the review process you will receive an email letting you know the outcome either if it 's approved or declined and if declined how come once your business content has been approved then your business will definitely be represented on the or listed on the business catalog if you have any queries with setting up your business profile or need any assistance please feel free to send an email to business at joondalup.wa.gov.eu thank you _"

a farm e-i-e-i-o well done we all know that song now that song had a cat that starts with C and a care that starts with C and my name is Christine which also starts with C so I thought I would look

cookie that 's good enough for me c is for cookie that 's good enough for me Oh cookie cookie cookie starts with C now if you take a round cookie and you take the bite out looks like a see if you take a round doughnut and you take a bio tale it also looks like a see but it 's not as good as a cookie not too Cookie Monster and sometimes the moon looks a bit like a see but you can 't_''_666.92 eat the moon so we 'll go back to see is for cookie that 's good enough for me c is for cookie that 's good enough for me c is for cookie that 's good enough for me Oh cookie cookie cookie starts with C well done everyone that was some good fun songs wasn 't it that was now we 've got a special activity and it 's both a song and game a clapping game do you know a song about a farmer who has a dog and the dog 's name is B I ng o do you guys know that one and you do moving the letters but every took a black line you clap and you sing the letters the red letters when they 're up the top hey you ready

going to read to you today is called leonardo the terrible monster by mo willems okay here we go leonardo was a terrible monster can you see leonardo he 's a cute little yellow monster sitting down here but he looks a little sad he couldn 't scare anyone he didn 't have 1642 teeth like tony wow look at all those teeth that 's a lot of teeth he wasn 't big like eleanor nope not big can you see eleanor all we can see of eleanor is her great big legs she 's not very small she 's very very tall and he wasn 't just playing weird like hector hmm leonardo tried very hard to be scary but he just wasn 't one day leonardo had an idea he would find the most scaredy cat kid in the whole wide world an idea leonardo researched until he found the perfect candidate can you see all the books that he had to read he went through all those books to find the perfect candidate and the perfect candidate was sam hmm leonardo snuck up on the poor unsuspecting boy and the monster gave it all he had until the little boy cried yes cheered leonardo i did it i finally scared the tuna salad out of someone no you didn 't snap sam oh yeah says leonardo then why are you crying my mean big brother stole my action figure right out of my hands while i was still playing with it and then it broke on purpose and then it 's my favorite toy and i tried to fix it but i couldn 't and i got so mad that i kicked the table and then i stubbed my toe and it was the same foot that i heard last month when i slept in the bathtub after i got soap in my eyes and then and i was just trying to wash out the burn poo that my brother 's have any friends and my tummy hurts said sam that 's why poor sam then leonardo made a very big decision instead of being a terrible monster he would become a wonderful friend and he gave sam a hug and he said it 's okay and they became good friends but that didn 't mean that he couldn 't try to scare his friend every now and then boom said leonardo can you see he made sam jump and now they 're playing chasey and that 's the end of the story do you think it would be fun to have a monster as a friend i think it might be lots of fun you could do all sorts of things with a

    "text": "hi everyone i 'm amanda kendall from the thoughtful travel podcast and this is a presentation series on how to be a better traveler for the city of joondalup libraries as covert 19 travel restrictions start to lift it 's a great time to think about how to travel more thoughtfully and this series will help you do just that this presentation is about how to be an environmentally friendly traveler i think that 's something we probably all aspire to we don 't want to damage the environment or be echo unfriendly when we travel and there 's probably lots of things we know about already but i thought i 'd put together this presentation just to remind us and perhaps give all of us some other ideas and food for thought about how we can be environmentally friendly travelers to start off with i have a short extract from an interview i did with louise sutherland a travel journalist who is a bit of an expert in environmentally friendly travel there 's lots of different things we can do to organize them in my mind i often put so that would be choosing how we get somewhere maybe offsetting the carbon emissions we we can 't avoid choosing low impact modes of transport such as um electric vehicles or bikes or sea kayaks or hiking instead of doing a driving trip some i don 't know if you know hertig root has just launched two hybrid cruise ships so you might choose i did hear those kind of um ships instead of the regular ones so there 's carbon missions that 's one category but the second one would be food so i guess looking at where your food is sourced when you 're away not always easy but you know low food miles and even zero kilometer restaurants are becoming more common organic places so i guess food that 's local organic seasonal plant-based you know choosing plant-based options when you travel which is also which also has the added advantage of keeping you healthier because in some countries like india it 's probably better for you to eat the plants than the meat which you don 't know how it 's been prepared or stored things i guess plastic is the most obvious thing but you know trying not to use single-use plastics trying to patronize places hotels or restaurants that don 't use single-use plastics even taking your own reusable not just bottles and cups but cutlery and lunch boxes and shopping bags things like that which is just a no-brainer now everyone seems to be doing that um well not everyone i guess not everyone but it 's certainly way more widespread yeah yes um and a lot of hotels now are switching from tiny toiletries to bulk dispensers which is something i always look at now when i go to hotels and if it 's if it 's got the tiny toiletries like they get a little black mark against their name um because it 's so common and it 's just yeah so we 've got we 've got carbon emissions food waste and i guess positive impact would be another one some hotels or ecologists will plant a tree for every guest to offset their emissions um you might look at you know there might be places that run cleanup days 's thoughts i wanted to put together five main ideas about how we can travel in a more environmentally friendly way so these are the five that i 've considered probably a combination of the most important and the ones where we can make a difference the most easily so the first one is reducing our carbon footprint also reducing litter and waste recycling avoiding bottled water because although that might be covered by those other two it 's one of the biggest culprits and needs to be addressed separately and finally being aware of green washing so let 's take those in a bit more detail first of all how can we reduce our carbon footprint how can we reduce carbon emissions connected to our travels obviously flying is not good in terms of carbon emissions as is cruising but if we think about flights and when we live in australia especially here in perth it 's quite hard to get many places without flying so there 's a few things we can do but one of them is to at least have non-stop flights where possible so sometimes we can stretch to have a non-stop flight then that makes a big difference to our carbon emissions because the biggest chunk of those emissions are coming from taking off and landing we can also pack light because that does make a difference to the emissions of an aircraft if all of us packed a lot less that would be a big difference again where possible when we 're in our destination if we can use public transport over driving then that 's better also driving over flying if we 're going a relatively short distance and also considering when we 're if we 're renting a vehicle or even purchasing considering using electric vehicles so that 's a bunch of ways that are not too difficult to do to try and reduce our carbon footprint now another important issue is trying to reduce the amount of litter and waste we produce you 've probably seen those horrifying pictures of places like in nepal you know getting up towards where the popular climbs are and there 's just a sea of plastic water bottles and things like that and and scary so here 's a few things that we can do a lot of which you 're probably doing already but you might not necessarily do it when you travel so one thing is to take with you things like reusable cutlery or reusable straws the thing that you 'll generally be given if you 're say buying food especially takeaway food but if you took your own then you could say no thanks i don 't need to create that waste similarly taking with you a keep cup or some kind of thermos for hot drinks now this is of course something we 're much more familiar with these days but don 't forget to do it when you travel too because you might visit some destinations where plastic bags are still rife so take with your reusable bags tote bags and the like another way to help with the reduction of litter and waste and especially with it you know getting into the into the ecosystem and causing calm is to consider if you 're going on a hike or a walk take a um take some something it and pick up the litter on your way now i 've got a bit of an interview from guidebook writer anna chittenden on some other ways you can reduce litter and waste on your travels so i think that there 's just like a lot of ways that people can just try and be sustainable like once they get to the destination um and i think that there 's lots of kind of like easy things that people can do so i think that there 's like the obvious things like you know taking your own bags when you 're going like taking tote bags when you 're going somewhere because especially in um i find this in places like singapore and even japan they like to give you a lot of plastic so yeah so everything they want to put they want to give you it 's it in plastic and then another plastic and then another plastic so i think a lot of it is just by like saying like you know refusing saying no and then just bringing your own um you know small tote bag plastic as people try and give you yes um so like bringing your bring your own tote bags bring your own coffee cups and um water bottles so just like bringing as much as you can so you don 't become you know one of those um annoying people that 's actually just you know like using more plastic while you 're traveling and actually like adding to um the problem because especially in places you know it might be somewhere like indonesia as well they might not have the infrastructure there to cope with you know more of the plastic and the waste so i think it 's just like bringing bringing as much as you can and just saying no if you know someone tries to give you sort of like plastic and you know bringing your own cups and everything related to all of this is of course making sure that you are recycling and trying to support businesses that are doing good recycling as well so for example when you 're deciding on your accommodation you might check into hotel recycling programs and if in particular tiny bottles of shampoo or shower gel then that would be a big tick for them and you could use them above other hotels sometimes this is unavoidable as a consumer it 's sometimes unavoidable and you might end up in a hotel where you do end up using those tiny toiletries if you do if it 's truly unavoidable then at least take the leftovers with you to use those half bottles uh will otherwise just get chucked out a lot of the time and that 's even worse than um than you know them existing in the first place i think and of course make sure you 're doing your own recycling whatever that whatever you 're buying if you 're buying things in recyclable packaging make sure you they that packaging ends up in a recycling bin wherever possible now as i mentioned earlier bottles of water are one of the worst culprits in terms of of damage to the environment when we 're out and about on our travels and there 's a few reasons for this and of course one of them is that if 't as safe to drink as here in australia then we 're even more likely to be drinking from bottled water so there 's a few things you can do for example using a refillable water bottle or using a water purifier and i 've got some information from tour operator bridie reed about some more alternatives to buying plastic water bottles so the first thing is the reusable water bottle of course everyone knows about this but um there are a couple of little twists to this because you know i think when you have a refillable water bottle this is really really good when you are traveling to a place where there is drinkable water however yes yes and i think you know it 's becoming easier to go into a cafe or a restaurant and ask for them to fill it up like it can feel a little bit weird but i think everyone is understanding that it 's worth the effort to do that and maybe the discomfort and i think um restaurants and hotels are becoming more good about it and however you know when potable water this can be a real issue um for a few reasons number one um you know bottled water is often a big source of income in certain little cafes and restaurants and and that can be an issue and of course the scourge of the the plastic water bottle and um particularly in places where uh there 's not much recycling so i would like to suggest a couple of things that you can have in your little zero waste travel kit the first is like an emergency plan plan b which is just a little these water purification tablets that you can buy and they these tiny little tablets they are really effective um at purifying water you know if you 're going hiking in europe and you need to take water from streams for example or if you 're in a place where there 's no portable water you just add one of these tablets into a litre of water and you will have clean water in half an hour so that 's a really good thing to have it 's they 're super light they there are these other two products that i have both of these and i find them really really great that one 's called a steripen are you familiar with the steripen i 've heard of it but i don 't exactly know how it works right so it 's purification of water through a uv light and it 's basically like a little wand and you turn it on and you put it in your litre of water and you stir and agitate the water for 90 seconds and your water is clean it 's really quite cool and um i always tell people because people i think are a little bit skeptical about it but just go online look at the the research behind how effective this is and you know decide for yourself now finally one important thing to be wary about when you are planning your travels and trying to be more environmentally friendly is green washing so this is especially the case if you are looking into a hotel or a tour company or even an airline and you 're trying to decide are these this of course comes from the idea of whitewashing and greenwashing is when an organization or a company like that tries to make themselves sound really green friendly really environmentally sound but sometimes it 's just a lot of words without much meaning behind it they might just even call themselves you know a green hotel but without anything to back that up so just be a little bit aware that greenwashing is a thing it 's a really marketable thing and people think oh yeah okay they 're environmentally sound i 'll go there but just be aware that there 's something to back that up it 's not just words so ways to do that to check if the company has some affiliations or certifications with some reputable organizations you can also just look out for their kind of openness and transparency so i genuinely echo friendly company will usually discuss this at some length on their website not just use the phrases you know sustainable or green there 'll be some clearer explanation about what they do and if you 're in doubt ask questions you 're a company before you decide to spend your money with them so just ask them directly you know what do you do about this do you recycle this or you know whatever it is that you have concerns about and i think the more that we as consumers do that the more that those companies will realize that they can 't be doing this green washing they need to be genuine so i hope that those tips have given you some more ideas about how you can be an environmentally friendly traveler you often will hear well i sometimes read and it worries me people saying that we can 't really we shouldn 't travel because it 's not an environmentally friendly thing to do especially with things like flying however i think that the benefits of travel far outweigh that and even the benefits to the environment of us traveling and learning more about the world so i along with the fact that we 're never going to stop traveling completely because all of us anyone watching this is probably hardwired to want to travel so um the best thing and try and find ways that you can be a really environmentally friendly traveler and enjoy it thanks for watching _"

    "text": "hi everyone i 'm amanda kendall from the thoughtful travel podcast and this is a presentation series on how to be a better traveler for the city of joondalup libraries as covert 19 travel restrictions start to lift it 's a great time to think about how to travel more thoughtfully and this series will help you do just that this presentation is about how to be a responsible traveler now of course we have to figure out really what we mean by responsible travel first there 's a few definitions here which i hope will help you think about what it means to travel responsibly so the first one is responsible tourism minimizes the negative impacts on the environment economy and culture it makes sense doesn 't it we don 't want to do harm or damage to a place that we visit although sometimes in the past when we 've traveled maybe we have if we go somewhere that 's heavily touristed and you know heaven forbid maybe we even litter or um we traipse over tracks that have already been uh eroded uh we um unwittingly uh give anything back to the local economy or we you know transgress against the local culture somehow just because we 're perhaps not so informed all of these things are things that probably all of us have done before i know i have but we don 't want to do them so that 's kind of the first step to thinking about being a responsible traveler now the next definition there responsible travel is treating others the way they wish to be treated so that goes to say a lot of things but also to say that just because we have a certain idea about things doesn 't mean that it 's necessarily the right way to do things here 's another idea responsible travel is being socially and culturally aware when you travel understanding your effect on the places you visit and trying to make that effect a positive one that 's kind of the ultimate goal isn 't it so not only do we not want to harm or leave damage behind when we travel but we want to leave a lasting positive impact if we can that negative social economic and environmental impacts it involves local people in decisions that affect their lives and it 's culturally sensitive encourages respect between tourists and locals and builds local pride and confidence i think that kind of sums up all of those previous definitions pretty well so over the years i have tried to learn and do better and become a more responsible traveler and i thought i 'd share a few of the ways that i 've tried to do this in recent times to give you some ideas of how we can try and travel more responsibly so this picture here that 's my son and he 's got standing with his rental bike outside the the kiosk where we rented them in copenhagen in denmark from a little business called bicycle so i knew we wanted to ride bikes around copenhagen for lots of reasons and i of course googled it before we got there to figure out where we 're going to rent them from and there 's heaps and heaps of choices you know copenhagen is a fabulous city for cyclists there 's lots a look through a few and then i found these guys that buy sir kelly who were not only they had decent bikes at a reasonable rate because that 's was still important for me but they were also a very um a responsible business with a big social conscience so part of their business model is that they also support um a bike workshop down in mozambique and they do this in various ways they send bikes and bike parts down there they even send their staff down um periodically to train locals in mozambique to be bike mechanics so that they 're then running their own business there and they generally support it in lots of different ways and i thought that that was a you know a good example of a nice responsible socially conscious business and i was really happy to support them and so i chose to spend my bicycle rental dollars in their direction rather than someone else here 's a closer to home example of being respectful of also the local wildlife which is a really important part of being a responsible traveller world animal protection with some more information about responsible wildlife tourism but this example was me last year in cairns in queensland and i got to visit fitzroy island which i highly recommend beautiful part of the world and while i was on fitzroy island i was able to visit the cairns turtle rehabilitation center and i you know got to learn all about their work and they 're doing fabulous work they 're rehabilitating turtles that have suffered various illness and injury um sadly a lot of it due to human intervention but they are now recovering there and then they as they recover they get released back into the sea and it was great to see their good work there another way to be a responsible traveler is simply to try and support local businesses often small local businesses rather than you know big multinationals you know stay in a small locally owned hotel rather than you know a big chain hotel that we all you know all those brands that we know so well here 's just a couple of examples the place on the left is in the south west called goanna cafe i highly recommend it and they didn 't pay me to say this they don 't even know i know who i was but i really love that spot and on the right you can see back in copenhagen as well i wanted to take a canal tour and there 's lots of you know different kinds of canal tours but this was a really special small local business called hey captain you could tell a lot about the business and the story and the owners and the staff from their website got to get a really good feel for it and i thought that 's where i 'm going to spend my canal cruising dollars and finally also being a responsible traveler means fitting in culturally learning about the local customs and you know respecting them so you can see on the left there that 's my son in fiji and he 's being taught how to wear his sulu properly as a mark of local respect and on the right is my son and i that 's my fingers and my lived in japan for a couple of years and i completely mastered the art of using chopsticks but my son without even much prompting for me decided long before we went to japan that he wanted to be able to eat everything there with chopsticks as well and so we practiced at home for a long time before we actually went to japan and once we were there as you see he at seven or eight was already a pretty adept at using chopsticks and it was quite sweet because the people in the restaurants would often come up as soon as we sat down and bring him a special knife and fork or a spoon and a fork and he 'd say no thanks i can use chopsticks and i was really kind of proud i have to say so you know another important attempt to respect the local culture so it 's also really important to be recognized what we don 't know and to try and find ways to learn about being a responsible traveler from others now one area which i think we don 't know about child safe tourism and i spoke with brett from social cycles about a particular aspect of child safe tourism that i think is important and it 's about orphanage tourism so what orphanage tourism actually is it turns out quite a lot of studies have shown that there 's unfortunately they produces about 80 of orphans in cambodia uh and across the world really uh have at least one living relative 18 digits 80 yeah yeah unicef sort of um studies uh suggest that it 's up to 80 so there 's a lot more orphanages now in cambodia today than there was 20 years ago and the country is in a much more stable state and there was no there 's been no natural disasters and no wars to speak of yet the volume the the quantity of orphanages has risen dramatically and therefore obviously the children in these orphanages has risen dramatically so so what 's happened in the last 20 years and if you look back the amount of tourists have increased uh and they 've come over and unfortunately what 's happened is that the know so to put it sort of quite simply you know there 's been one orphanage there and uh some tourists have gone and they 've helped and they 've raised money and all this sort of thing uh and that 's great and the authentic has taken all this money and has done sort of quite well with it and then someone else like another local has sort of looked around and said geez you seem to be doing well what are you doing for a living it 's like well i run an orphanage and all these people give me money and so then that person 's gone well geez that 's a good idea i better go and start my own orphanage so what that does is it turns the children almost into a commodity so then that person needs to go out and find children therefore they go out to the rural areas and they they find the poorest kind of families and they say you 've got five children give me two of them i will sort of it 's almost like a cell you 'll find them jobs you know this and the other and you know and they 'll be fed and all this and i 'll help them and then you can use your you know family income to sort of look after the other two or three or whatever it may be so it 's a really difficult decision for these families to do and it 's they 're not sort of giving them away but there 's a lot of false promises uh that are coming and it 's so then what happens is so there 's a bunch of children uh so and then obviously the tourists are coming and they 're volunteering and they 're raising money to help this orphanage and whatnot but completely ignorant and unaware that these children have families so there 's just a spiral of like short-term volunteers coming in and teaching this like teaching english so okay so let 's do abc 's and you know all this sort of thing and then next week a different jurors would come and go okay uh what are we gonna do all right let of abcs and really sort of you know no curriculum or anything like that because it that 's not what 's so important the important is that the donations keep coming another aspect of responsible travel that i think it 's important we learn more about is how to be an ethical wildlife tourist there 's so many animal attractions around the world and we want to make sure that we 're visiting them responsibly and avoiding those that well we should be avoiding i chatted with ben from world animal protection about some of the issues in responsible wildlife tourism wild animal tourism actually makes up a very big segment of overall tourism a large segment is actually driven by people wanting to have an experience with a wild animal now as you say i think the message has very much got through in a country like this that riding elephants is not okay and that 's good uh that 's really good but you know that 's not the only thing that causes cruelty and really at the heart of wild animal tourism inappropriate and cruel wild animal cruelty actually happens behind the scenes so you then have this paradox where people who love animals and go to see these animals are actually contributing to cruelty into those animals suffering so what to look out for so take um take riding elephants great as i said i think people have generally got the message now don 't ride an elephant but the reason we don 't want you to ride an elephant in particular is because the training process needed to get that elephant to a point where it will be uh consent to being ridden by a human is just utterly barbaric it 's essentially a process in which their spirit is broken they are brutalized they are in fear of the major the trainer who oversees them the problem we have is that some people then say okay i won 't do that but what i will do is i will go and uh you know wash an elephant or bathe it or jump in a river stream with it now the concern we have there is in many cases again that 's still a wild pool with a human being or be in such close contact with them and those animals in many cases have also gone through that process they may you know have they may have stopped writing them and now got them to do this but you still got animals that have gone through that process and in particular and it comes back to the point i made about the quackers it still kind of sends the message that that 's what wild animals are for you know they 're sort of an entertainment prop so you jump in the water you wash them you engage with them but it 's all about you if you know what i mean it 's not about that animal i mean these are wild animals and they belong in the wild they don 't want to be in contact with you they 're not domesticated and when you go to a venue which offers you something like that offers you an experience of the wild animal in which they 're behaving in a way that they wouldn 't be we urge you not to do much be guaranteed that the animal has been treated very badly to get it where it consents to that kind of behavior and then also of course there are all the associated issues i mean particularly when we think about the way in which animals are kept uh for example we did a report on bali a couple of years ago and our undercover researchers came out and said look the the animals are chained every night on short chains they 're on concrete the enclosures are absolutely tiny so i hope that all of that information gives you some more ideas about how you too can be a more responsible traveler here are my three biggest tips and i hope that hope that they prove useful to you when you 're planning your future travels first of all do the research before and during your trip often it 's just a matter of a quick google to find out okay this place is you know more appropriate for my spending than another it might be a quick a quick google search to discover that you know there 's a lots of different things you can do and because it 's so becoming a more important issue these days it 's not hard to find some research might be a blog post or some reviews on a tripadvisor or some similar forum where you can find out a bit more information and decide is this a responsible choice also while you 're on your trip ask some more questions you might be wanting to say book a quick day trip somewhere and you 're there in the offices of some tour companies you can ask them you know um how are guides trained how are they re you know renumerated um is this you know respectful who owns this business where are my dollars gonna end up that kind of thing you don 't have to you can ask politely and a good business will be really happy to show and share with you that they are a responsible business and basically just whenever you have the choice make a responsible choice consider local businesses ethical businesses socially conscious businesses and although none of us can get it right all doing a bit of research and asking around we can make a lot of difference and the more of us who do it the more that tour operators and other operators in the travel market will realize that we want to be more responsible travelers so i hope that helps and enjoy being a responsible traveler on your next trip thanks so much for watching you _"

    "text": "hi thanks for watching in this short series of videos i 'm going to take you on an astro safari to some of the strangest and frankly most terrifying objects in the universe and explain what happens to stars including the sun when they reach the end of their lives everybody 's heard of black holes but they 're only one of the ways that stars can die there are other end states that are just as exotic in this video i 'm going to talk about white dwarfs which is going to be the eventual fate of our own star but first let 's cover a concept that 's central to everything that i 'm going to discuss that of the balance of forces one side of the balance is always occupied by gravity which pulls everything together towards the center of mass that 's very important remember that bit if there was nothing to balance against that and gravity could act unchecked then every object stars planets and even you would collapse into a black hole but here 's the thing gravity is actually a very weak force objects with intensely strong gravitational fields to demonstrate how weak gravity can be consider that when you pick up a paperclip with a small magnet that magnet is out pulling the gravity of an entire planet so there are various forces that act to counter the inward pull of gravity and as long as they 're strong enough then any given object is stable however if a given force is not strong enough then gravity will win against it and will crush the object until some other force proves strong enough to resist and provide a new balance for objects such as people or planets the counter force is electromagnetic the negatively charged electrons surrounding atomic nuclei repel each other preventing them from getting too close in a star it 's somewhat different stars are made of gas and as gravity compresses the gas it heats it up until eventually the temperature and density in the middle of the star reaches a point where hydrogen nuclei undergo nuclear fusion combining to form helium and releasing energy in the form of radiation that radiation exerts an outwards pressure trying to blow then the star expands but then the radiation pressure is reduced as a result and gravity gets the upper hand and compresses it the two forces reach an equilibrium and the star settles down and becomes stable what we call a main sequence star stars remain on the main sequence as long as there is hydrogen to keep fusing maintaining the radiation pressure that keeps gravity at bay but eventually the hydrogen in the core of the star becomes depleted and the radiation pressure is reduced so gravity begins to win crushing the core of the star inwards that heats the core up even further and if there is enough mass for the crushing to reach a critical temperature then the helium that was the ash left over from the hydrogen burning phase will itself fuse creating heavier elements such as carbon nitrogen and oxygen and providing radiation pressure to once again allow the star to reach a new equilibrium but a side effect of those higher temperatures is that the outer regions of the star away from the fusion occurring in the core will be heated up and expand of the star balloons dramatically and the star has now become a red giant this will happen to the sun it 's about halfway through its lifespan at the moment in five billion years time it will expand into a red giant consuming at the very least mercury and venus and very probably the earth as well i don 't plan on losing any sleep about it the sun will put on a pretty good show for anybody that does happen to be around at that time because it will form what 's called a planetary nebula so called because in the early days of telescope astronomy people would see these little ring-shaped or disc shaped objects and get a little bit excited and think it 's a planet but no it 's the outer layers of the red giant puffed completely off into space escaping the star 's gravity and then getting pushed away by the radiation of the dying star in the centre and getting lit up to create these quite beautiful objects so what happens to the remnant in the middle after all of its fuel is before i explain what it is let 's have a little look at how they were discovered the first to be seen was 40 eridani b a very faint companion star to the more sun-like 40 eridani a which for star trek fans is the home star of the planet vulcan but we won 't get into that 40 eridani b was discovered in 1783 by william herschel also famous for discovering uranus a real planet not a planetary nebula it was thought to just be a very faint ordinary star as the concept of white dwarfs didn 't exist for over another century the second to be discovered initially made its presence known by its absence friedrich bessel a great astronomer of the 19th century and the first person to accurately measure the distance to another star made observations in 1844 of sirius the brightest star in the night sky and he discovered that it had a wobble that must be accompanied by an invisible companion it wasn 't until 18 years later that this very faint companion star sirius b was first seen by the early years of very unusual about these stars they were white in colour indicating quite a high surface temperature and yet they were very faint indicating they were quite small in size astronomers were able to use measurements of those two quantities to get an estimate of their radius and they seemed to be about as big as the earth far smaller than any star had any right to be additionally because both forty eridani b and sirius b orbit other stars timings of their orbits allowed an estimate of their mass and sirius b for example seemed to weigh about as much as the sun this combination of utterly unheard of factors was initially quite baffling for example the famous astronomer arthur stanley eddington said the message of the companion of sirius when it was decoded ran i am composed of material 3 000 times denser than anything you have ever come across a ton of my material would be a little nugget that you could put in a matchbox what reply can one make to such a message the reply which most of us made in 1914 was shut up don made of something completely outside of human experience in order to provide a uniform unit of reference for all the objects i 'm discussing i 'm going to be comparing their density to that of this cherry tomato i wanted to use grapes but they 're not in season if this was made out of white dwarf material it would weigh about as much as an african elephant what on earth can account for such an impossibly high density the answer came less than a decade later with the development of quantum mechanics and ralph fowler used the newly developed poorly exclusion principle to come up with a solution now don 't worry i 'm not going to get into a whole lot of esoteric mathematics here but the question that needs to be answered is this with the radiation pressure turned off in the dead heart of the star what point of stability provides the next equilibrium against the crushing force of gravity now the poorly exclusion principle basically amounts to a sort of quantum snobbery electrons it turns out don 't like being the same as each other the same amount of energy so if you squash a whole bunch of them together then for quantum reasons some of them will have more energy than you would otherwise expect and this energy provides a pressure that stops the further gravitational collapse of the star for reasons i 'm not going to get into this is called electron degeneracy pressure and the stuff inside the white dwarf is called electron degenerate matter now once they 've reached that equilibrium point they are dead objects they 're not burning any more fuel and they 're not generating any more energy but they have a large amount of residual heat left over from their last years as a star so they are white hot and electron degenerate matter is opaque to radiation meaning that it takes a very long time for that heat to escape from the core of the white dwarf into space so they stay hot for a surprisingly long period of time the universe is 13.8 billion years old the oldest white dwarfs have been around for an appreciable portion of that but they 're still at temperatures take over a trillion years for them finally to cool all the way down to just above absolute zero and become cold cinders drifting through the void no longer white dwarfs now black dwarfs now note that 's quite different to black holes which are completely different objects and i 'll cover that in my third video however not all white dwarfs will go that quietly and meekly into the night a small proportion of them will annihilate themselves in some of the most spectacularly violent explosions seen anywhere in the universe this happens when the white dwarf is part of a binary system with another star and they orbit each other closely enough that the white dwarf 's gravity can pull material off the surface of its companion that material will fall onto and accrete on the surface of the white dwarf and when it reaches a critical threshold the fusion reaction will restart in a flash and the white dwarf will blow itself apart in a supernova explosion that will briefly outshine its host galaxy so that 's a brief overview of white dwarfs and a glimpse into made in this video is precisely that that we 're talking about stars roughly equivalent to the sun in terms of mass in my next video i will cover what happens to stars that weigh significantly more than the sun and they become different objects called neutron stars thanks for watching _"

    "text": "hi welcome back at the end of my last video i mentioned that white dwarfs are the ultimate fate of stars roughly equivalent in size to the sun and in this video i 'm going to talk about what happens to stars significantly larger than that and while doing so i 'm going to reference a unit of measurement that astronomers use called the solar mass which is exactly as it sounds so two solar masses means twice the mass of the sun and so on this will allow us to talk about what the thresholds are when a star is too big for example to become a white dwarf and also allow a comparison of the final mass of an object with the mass of the original star so for example the white dwarf that will result at the end of the sun 's life will not weigh as much as the sun i mentioned how when the sun expands into a red giant it 'll throw off its outer layers and become a planetary nebula and so the final white dwarf will weigh significantly less current estimates are solar mass so whatever the threshold for the actual white dwarf is the star that gives rise to it can be significantly larger than that and it would seem that stars of a mass up to about 10 solar masses will result in a white dwarf however the white dwarf will not be heavier than 1.44 solar masses that is the absolute upper limit for how heavy a white dwarf can get it 's called the chandrasekhar limit named after the nobel prize-winning physicist subramian chandrasekhar he along with others had extended the work of fowler who had come up with the idea of electron degeneracy as a mechanism by which white dwarfs could support themselves against gravity and chandrasekhar 's breakthrough was realizing that there was an upper limit to that that if the mass of the white dwarf was too large its gravity would be too strong and it would collapse past that point supported by electron degeneracy now this was controversial at the time physics at that point was dominated by arthur eddington a giant of physics second in his day only to einstein the problem was no known mechanism beyond electron degeneracy that seemed capable of stopping the complete gravitational collapse of the star into the already theorized black hole and eddington and albert einstein at that point loathed the idea of black holes and thought they were nonsense eddington remained opposed to chandrasekhar 's ideas for the rest of his life this was one of the reasons why chandrasekhar did not actually receive his nobel prize for his discoveries for over 50 years after he published his paper there are multiple ironies here not just are black holes real but that is irrelevant to discussion of what happens beyond the chandrasekhar limit two years after chandrasekhar did his work in 1930 the subatomic particle the neutron had been discovered and less than two years after that walter bader and fritz zwicky first proposed the existence of the neutron star the discovery of the neutron had led to the understanding that the nucleus of an atom consisted of protons and neutrons with a cloud of electrons around the nucleus the proton has a positive charge the electron has an equal negative charge and the neutron which bada and zwicky theorized was that under sufficient pressures the electrons would combine with the protons via a process called electron capture to produce more neutrons these neutrons would then be subject to the same quantum snobbery of the poorly exclusion principle that prevented electrons from getting too close in white dwarfs to produce a neutron degeneracy pressure that in combination with other nuclear forces would provide another stable point resisting gravitational collapse this model also helps to explain supernovas not the kind that i described in my last video of self-destructing white dwarfs but the kind that results from the death of a star of more than 10 solar masses when stars that large run out of fuel their core can 't_''_279.04 be supported by the white dwarf process and undergoes a catastrophic collapse generating neutrons that will lead to the formation of the neutron star but the outer layers get heated up in the collapse and there is a massive fusion flash that blows the rest of the star away in a supernova this was all fascinating but partly due to franz wiki 's difficult personality plus the that they remained unverified theoretical curiosities for several decades however in 1967 franco pacini worked out that they might emit radio waves and at the same time jocelyn bell and anthony hewish picked up odd signals from their radio telescope in cambridge this regular series of pulses each 1.3 seconds apart was utterly unlike anything that had been detected from space previously in fact the regularity of it was so unusual it almost looked like an artificial beacon and the signal was initially given the semi-joking name of lgm1 for little green men but it was quickly determined that it was a natural source that of a rotating neutron star anthony hewish was later awarded the nobel prize for his discovery his co-discoverer jocelyn bell was not that 's another nobel prize controversy that i 'm not going to get into here so what are neutron stars like well due to the different way they 're formed the smallest neutron star can actually be slightly lighter than the heaviest white dwarf and they range between 1.1 to 2.1 solar masses but the neutrons can be packed much more closely together white dwarf might be about the size of the earth a neutron star is perhaps just 10 kilometers across vastly denser so if we use our reference object of a cherry tomato which again if it was made of white dwarf material would weigh about as much as an african elephant if this was made of neutron star material then would weigh somewhere within the ballpark of uluru that hugely concentrated mass makes everything about neutron stars ridiculously extreme for example they have magnetic fields that are anywhere from hundreds of millions to a quadrillion times stronger than that of the earth and those magnetic fields generate beams of radio waves that are emitted along the north and south magnetic poles similarly to earth the magnetic poles do not necessarily align with the rotational pole meaning that as the neutron star spins this beam of radio waves sweeps across the heavens like a cosmic lighthouse and that 's what jocelyn bell and anthony hewitt discovered this beam of radio waves sweeping across the earth in a regular series of pulses that gave the phenomenon its common name of pulsar but means that 's how fast this object heavier than the sun is rotating and that 's because as it 's collapsing down in the supernova that gives birth to it all of that mass is being pulled in and it spins faster similarly to how an ice skater spins faster when they pull their arms in and 1.3 seconds sounds fast but it 's far from the quickest there are some what they call millisecond pulsars and the fastest spins on its axis 716 times a second while weighing more than the sun that extraordinary density also leads to massive surface gravity now i 'll go into more detail about that in my third video on black holes but suffice to say that a neutron star can have a surface gravity 200 billion times stronger than that of the earth if you dropped a one kilogram weight one meter above the surface of a neutron star it would hit traveling at 1400 kilometers per second with an explosive force equaling 200 tons of tnt that gravity is so strong that it bends light such that if you 're looking at from the far side will be curved around and you will see more than 50 percent of its surface you will see some of the far side because of the bending of the light waves they are some of the deadliest objects in the universe they emit huge amounts of ionizing radiation that would sterilize anything that got close to them in the unlikely event you were able to shield yourself from that the magnetic field would interfere with the biochemistry in your body and kill you that way instead and yet despite this hostility it 's possible for neutron stars to have planets presumably having either survived the supernova or be captured later in fact the very first planets that were discovered outside the solar system were found orbiting a pulsar back in the early 90s and they were discovered because as they orbit around the pulsar they alter the timing of those pulses very slightly even accounting for small discrepancies like that the timing of signals from pulsars is so reliably regular that it has been suggested they be used as a sort of galactic gps capable of or even interstellar distances in fact several space probes that were launched by nasa back in the 70s pioneers 10 and 11 and voyager 1 and 2 had plaques with messages on them in case they got picked up by aliens at some point in the distant future including a pulsar map indicating the planet of origin of the probes i wouldn 't be worried about visitors it 's going to take hundreds of thousands of years for those probes to get anywhere close to another star now for years it was thought that neutron stars were the last stop before oblivion that there 's no other mechanisms like electron or neutron degeneracy that could prevent larger more massive objects from collapsing into black holes but there are hypotheses one such is quark stars now protons and neutrons are not themselves fundamental objects they are in turn made up of even smaller particles called quarks and under ordinary circumstances it 's literally impossible to rip a quark free from a proton or neutron it takes so much energy to do so that by einstein 's e equals m c squared will immediately bind to the one you tried to rip free but perhaps in neutron stars massive enough to just be teetering on the brink it 's possible that the core may contain free quarks there have been conjectured observations of quark stars before but several of them have turned out to be false alarms but there is one candidate discovered in the last couple of years that is still being investigated and may possibly be one of these quark stars even more extreme than neutron stars so there we go that is a tour of some of the most extreme objects in the universe and i am very glad that the closest one to our solar system is over 400 light years away so in my third and final video i will talk about the most mysterious objects in the universe black holes i 'll try and debunk one or two myths about them see you then you _"

    "text": "hi welcome back to my third and final video this one on black holes or spooky black holes have been a staple of science fiction for many years I think they feel much the same niche as whirlpools do in maritime stories reaching all the way back to the ancient Greeks they 're an inescapable force of nature that will suck you down and swallow you without a trace but are they really that dangerous well yes but they are bound by the same physical laws as everything else in the universe they 're not magical they don 't get to break the rules they give the appearance of bending some of them but they 're prone to a lot of misconceptions for example I 've been asked by more than one person who had discovered that there is an exceptionally large black hole in the center of our Milky Way if that 's the reason for the spiral shape of our galaxy that we 're all swirling down the plughole and given enough time it 's going to eat us all well no so to begin with I 'm every object in the universe this is Isaac Newton 's law of universal gravitation don 't worry there won 't be a test but this is the equation used to calculate the gravitational force exerted by any object and this term here says that to get the force we need to divide by the square of the distance to the center of mass of the object you 'll recall that in the first video I said that was something important to remember and here we are it means that gravity is one of a class of laws called inverse square laws there are similar ones for light and sound and anything else that radiates out in all directions an implication is that force drops off quite quickly the further away you get from the object here on the surface of the earth where 6,400 kilometers from the centre so if we travel 6400 kilometers into space doubling the distance we 'll feel one quarter of the gravitational force 3 times 9 for times 16 and so on in an example that 's counterintuitive to a lot of people if we with a black hole of the same mass we would be the same distance from the center of mass and so we would feel the same gravitational force the earth would continue in its orbit not even noticing we 'd all freeze to death I 'm not saying it would be a good thing but the point is that a little bit of distance goes a long way towards making you safe now the converse of this is true if you decrease the distance to the center by which I don 't mean drilling a hole down to the center of the earth means that gravity will increase as you drop down it because there 's lots of mess above you now if we increase the density making the object smaller then the gravity will increase if we make it half the radius then 4 times the gravity one-third the radius 9 times the gravity and that starts stacking up quite quickly which means that if you get extremely dense objects they 've got phenomenal gravitational pulls at the surface a white dwarf has about 150 hundred and sixty thousand 10 trillion times the Earth 's gravity and black holes are just truly frightening the gravitational pull determines the escape velocity from an object using Isaac Newton 's example of firing a cannon if the velocity is low the Cannonball will fall to earth quite quickly the faster it goes the further it will travel until at a certain critical velocity it will circle all the way around the earth without falling and you will be in orbit if you travel a little bit faster than this then it will escape never to return so a black hole is called inescapable because at a certain distance from it the escape velocity is higher than the speed of light meaning that not even light can escape from it and given the fact that we know from the theory of relativity that nothing can travel faster than the speed of light this means that nothing can escape from it the basic concept of stars too large for light to escape from it 's actually surprising the old one and early and rather underappreciated scientist John Mitchell came up with the idea in calculations to work out how large they were however he used the density of our Sun making them impossibly huge he had no reason to believe that super dense objects existed in 1915 Albert Einstein revealed his general theory of relativity in less than a year after that the German physicist Carl vast shield used relativity to make the calculations that form the basis of our modern understanding of black holes regreted Lee just a few months after that he died on the Eastern Front of World War one his equations allow us to determine the fast shield radius which is the distance from a black hole at which the escape velocity equals that of light the actual black hole itself is smaller much smaller there is nothing physical at the space shield radius but the sphere defined by that radius is called the event horizon of a black hole from within that volume no information can escape it is all unknowable and so the event horizon is usually what is considered the physical extent of a black hole so using my cherry tomato if this was the event horizon to the entire earth stellar-mass black holes are obviously larger for something the size of our Sun the radius is about three kilometres now while Einstein respect it 's fast yields work he and other scientists like Arthur Eddington did not believe that black holes were objects that could physically exist it seemed to produce nonsensical results that something could be crushed beyond the point of any force being able to resist it and yet just as Chandrasekhar showed that there was an upper limit to how large white dwarfs could get beyond which electron degeneracy pressure could support them there is a similar limit for neutron stars calculated by three scientists and this is known as the Tollman Oppenheimer volkov limit one of those names is of course more famous from another area of physics J robert Oppenheimer was the head of the Manhattan Project and so-called father of the atomic bomb he kept busy he did other things apart from them their calculations have been tweaked somewhat since they first made them modern consensus is that above about 2.1 7 solar masses the neutron star can no longer force that can stop the collapse with our current understanding of physics this leads to some odd results it seems that in the center of a black hole it diverges to infinity infinite density zero dimensions with mass what 's called a singularity a lot of physicists believe that this is just due to our incomplete understanding that with something like the pursued quantum theory of gravity we will discover there is something that stops this divergence to infinity so so-called stellar-mass black holes arise when exceptionally large stars above about 30 solar masses exploded supernovas at the end of their life just like the ones that give rise to neutron stars except that the cause keep collapsing to form black holes now how might you ask do we discover these dark objects that swallow light well in 1964 a balloon carried an x-ray telescope above the Earth 's atmosphere and found the first-ever still a mass black hole Cygnus x1 is a binary system with one of the components being a black hole and similarly to how I described that white dwarfs in binary systems can pull matter off down toward the black hole and as it spirals in it heats up very very high temperature to the point where it emits beams of x-rays and it 's that x-ray signature that the telescope detected now to be fair this is still ever so slightly conjectural there are a number of these so-called close contact binaries and some of them are very clearly neutron stars also pulling material off their companion and emitting x-rays but there are a number of signatures that are characteristic of neutron stars and certain close contact binaries do not exhibit those signatures and the only thing that we know of in theory that could account for this is that it 's a black hole there is another class of object for which there seems no explanation except that they 'd be black holes these are the supermassive black holes found in the center of most galaxies they are not still a mess by any stretch of the imagination they range in size from tens of millions up to billions of solar masses and the reason we think they must be black holes is because good enough views of the center of our Milky Way to be able to observe stars in close orbit around sachit Arius a star the central object by measuring the speed of the stars orbits we can calculate a star 's mass by seeing how close they come we can place upper limits on the size of a star it is so massive and so small that it is now considered conclusively proven that it must be a supermassive black hole now last year there was a rather exciting development in which a consortium of astronomers have managed to obtain the first ever direct images of a black hole in another galaxy and I can think of no better way to round out this video than with this absolutely astonishing view down the throat of oblivion in the center of a galaxy over 15 million light-years away our knowledge of black holes is still in its infancy but with tools like this at astronomer disposal it can only imagine what sort of discoveries lie ahead of us so that brings us to the end of my video series on some universe with I hope you enjoyed it thank you _"

    "text": "hello everybody hello and welcome to another special city of ginger up library 's online top of the time my name is Nessa and I 'm gonna be seized and songs and reading a book with you today but before we get started let 's sing our welcome song I 'm sure you know it it 's toddler time sun shining it 's time for some fun it 's toddler time sunshiny welcome everyone welcome welcome I 'm so glad you can be with us today now before we get started into our theme and into our stuff I think we need to sing some songs and loosen up and get ourselves moving and dancing a bit so the first song we 're gonna sing we 're gonna cut our hands ready we clap our hands together we clap our hands together we clap our hands together because it 's fun today we nod our heads together we know ahead together we nod our heads together because it 's fun to do I 'm gonna stop her feet next I 'm gonna say sitting but you 'll see my feet her feet together because it 's Fanta whoa next we 're gonna wiggle our arms we wiggle eyes together we gotta help us together that way we got ants together because it 's fun to do that was fun moving a lot of body parts in that song and the next song has a few body parts as well Olinda if you can guess what they are yeah do you think you know I think you do it 's head shoulders knees and toes so I follow along with me heads and shoulders knees and toes knees and toes knees and toes heads and shoulders knees and toes we all cut hands together eyes and ears and math and nice mapping nice mouth and nice eyes and ears and mouth and nose feet okay pence you ever gonna do it again but I 'm gonna do it very slowly okay heads and shoulders knees and toes knees and toes knees and toes heads and shoulders knees and toes together and that was a bit too slow for me I like to move it a bit more quickly so do it to keep up yeah yeah yeah let 's dude okay okay hey there Joe does knees and toes oh good news I 've already messed up let 's try again this time no arresting up do it perfectly if you can 't let 's try heads and shoulders knees and toes knees and toes knees and toes head shouders knees toes we have had together I said his head mother knows mother knows whether those are better those we talked about you get oh that was fun oh I got it wrong the first time and that you would have got it right at home if not that 's okay it 's okay to make mistakes every once in a while and what are we gonna sing next we 're gonna sing one of my favorite songs it is involving a trip to the moon so before we go to the moon we 're gonna put on our space helmet zip a spacesuit put on eye space boots and oh what a nice heat book hey you ready to go zoom zoom zoom we 're going to the zoo zoo to take a trip come on my rocket ship zoom zoom zoom we 're going to them five four three two one blast-off how do I go to the moon one day I come to learn I think we 're getting on to the moon again I like going to the moon twice I like to see it twice sorry chief elsu looked already zoom zoom Z we 're going to them zoom zoom zoom we 're going very soon if you want to take a trip come on my rocket ship zoom zoom zoom we 're going to down five four three two one what we go where it 's time only time to read a story but before I realized sorry we couldn 't get all the rest of these wheels are still very Wiggly and sometimes it 's nice to be wiggly but listening to your story it 's good to be still sorry no way my fingers I 'm gonna wiggle my toes I 'm gonna wiggle actually old hitters and we got my nose all the Wiggles are at me and now is quiet this 's very really as well in it can you guess who it might be it is of course the very hungry little Caterpillar by Eric Carle and holy moly this book is ginormous it 's bigger than my face is it this is gonna be really fun to read all right now Very Hungry Caterpillar do you think all the pages will fit on the screen that you 're watching let 's see if we can try that oh here we go hi I said shiny in the light of the moon a little egg lay on a leaf on Sunday morning the Sun came up a nap popped a tiny and very hungry little caterpillar he started to look for some food on Monday he ate through one red apple on Tuesday he ate through two green pears but he was still hungry on Thursday he ate through one three big purple plums but he was still hungry on Thursday he ate through one two Oh red ripe strawberries YUM love strawberries but woody fool it was still hungry on Friday he ate through one two three four five still hungry on Saturday holy moly look at all this food on Saturday he ate through one piece of chocolate cake one ice cream cone one pickle one slice of Swiss cheese one slice of salami one lollipop one piece of cherry pie one sausage one cupcake and one slice of watermelon hmm oh good night he had a stomachache oh oh that is quite a lot of food for a little caterpillar oh I would 've had a stomachache too the next day was Sunday again and he ate through one nice green leaf hmm that 's better isn 't it he wasn 't hungry anymore but it wasn 't a little cuddle caterpillar anymore either it was a big fat caterpillar he made himself a home called a cocoon you built it around himself and he stayed inside for more than two weeks when he was ready to come out he nibbled a hole in the cocoon pushed his way out and then became ah a beautiful butterfly look at all the colors on his wings there 's red there 's blue some yellow and orange and some this book I love this book and Erika who wrote this book and many other beautiful books has described his books is half book half toy well Cosette children can play with make reading fun and encourage print motivation now children print motivation are more excited and more keen to learn how to read so try and have lots of books around your house that have flaps like this and lift the flap books like the spot books are great books where little fingers can explore and touch and manipulate the page and hope their little fingers through and trace around objects are all great urban courage and print motivation because anything that you can get tactile makes reading more fun than it already is all right now I think we should sing some songs about bugs do you I know lots of songs about bugs and I know a song about spider you want to sing this one with me let 's get at Incy Wincy Spider is ready Incy Wincy Spider climbed up the water spout down came the rain and washed the spider out out came the Spider climbed up the spout again should we sing that one one more time Oh Incy Wincy Spider climbed up the water spout down came the rain and washed poor Incy out out came the Sun and dried up all the rain so Incy Wincy Spider climbed up the spout again our next song we 're gonna sing about a little snail just a little friend we find in our garden sometimes now if you want to make a snail get your fist into a little hand like that hand into a little fist and stick a little finger out and your snail can 't pull up your arm like that but I 've got a little friend to help me it is just a puppet but it is too cute not to use look at him you do know dude Oh a little snail you 're gonna help me sing this next song yes yes it is alright let 's go so you use your little hand your little fist and finger to climb up your arm along with me okay slowly slowly very slowly crept good garden snail up on my shoulder now alright little snail I 'm gonna pluck you off Brook gently put you down here and you can crawl off and have another adventure somewhere else the next part of the song goes a bit quicker because you 've got a little mouse and mice are very speedy aren 't they so this mouse is gonna go quickly quickly quickly very quickly went there little mouse quickly quickly very quickly round about their house that Mouse is run off it 's going to hide mites are very quick aren 't they well they don 't matter all them that is I to run back in this little hole all right so I 've got a few more songs to see for you and the next one is one of my favorite about one of my very favorite animal insects that we find in our garden and that 's a bee so we 've got our bee hive and that 's sitting there here is the Beehive but where are the bees they 're hiding away where nobody sees watch and you 'll see them come business business business business business again here is the bee hive but where are the bees they 're hiding away where nobody sees watch and you 'll see them come out of the hive one two three four five [Music] I 'm gonna sing about another fuzzy animal and that 's a fly Oh flies can be annoying can 't_''_815.97 they let 's just ask Peter Rabbit who had a fly upon his nose cut your bunny ears ready little Peter Rabbit had a fly upon his nose little Peter Rabbit had a fly upon his nose little Peter Rabbit had a fly upon his nose and he switched it and he switched it and it flew away bye fly pesty fly you shoot you don 't bother me oh oh he 's coming back oh no he 's hiding on my chin little Peter Rabbit had a fly upon his chin little Peter Rabbit had a fly upon his chin little Peter Rabbit had a fly upon his team and he switched it and he switched it and it flew away Oh shoo shoo shoo shoo shoo shoo all what a pest I 've got something really fun to show you now so we had a little snail puppet and now I 've got a little caterpillar toy puppet I 'm gonna show you and tell you a little story about this caterpillar and what happens when he turns into a butterfly so you saw in our book today that we read caterpillar was hatched from a little egg he ate and ate and ate and then built the cocoon around himself so I 've got this little caterpillar here you might see him in your garden maybe it 's stripy like this maybe it 's green I 've got lots of green caterpillars in my garden and they eat my tomatoes which is very naughty of them so I like my tomatoes but that 's alright so after he 's eating it but very hard and builds a cocoon around itself now when this cocoon is around itself inside a marvelous change is happening because when you think about it how many legs does a caterpillar have yeah quite a few and how many legs does a butterfly go I 'm sinking about it when you look at a butterfly it doesn 't look like a caterpillar that just has got wings on it the body is completely different the caterpillars body is kind of one long beat body but the butterfly 's body is quite skinny and divided into three sections isn 't it they 're very different looking animals so can you imagine what is going on inside this cocoon while it 's changing it is marvellous there 's really really a cool incredible thing now have you have you had enough time to change hasn 't quite been two weeks but we 'll see how this little butterfly is going yeah yeah it 's ready to come out let 's see so when it comes out of its cocoon it takes a little while so as you can imagine losing a few legs growing some wings changing your body completely is a lot of hard work so when a butterfly comes out you take some time stretches his wings just practices using them because never used them before flutters them along make sure everything is we go okay butterfly are your wings happy yeah all right and then when they 're ready no butterfly will canter visit some flowers I think want a visit why don 't maybe maybe time to visit your garden know what other sort of bugs are in your garden what I like you to do is if it 's nice and sunny when it 's nice and sunny go out into your garden and see how many bugs you can find that we saw about today sir we some about spider a snail a B a fly caterpillar and a butterfly all right Sarah one important thing to remember is we don 't touch our buggy friends no they 're very little and they don 't want to be disturbed and you don 't want to get any bites or stings or anything nasty like that so we just look for a moment at our little buggy friends we can say hello and we can say oh thank you thank you for all the nice things you do for nature because bees these are very important they help our flowers a bit scary I had me but they do an important job they eat nasty little pests in the garden stop their being too many little bugs about and even flies that are quite annoying as Peter Rabbit will tell you have their place in our planet so they are important too so go ahead and see how many little bugs you can find maybe you 'll even find a bug that we haven 't had a song about today maybe a ladybug or a Slater or a dragonfly or an ant there are so many things you can look for I hope you lots of fun well that 's all the time we 've got for the moment but I will see you again another time before we go in and sing one last song together slowly alright and now our time is done we 've had a lot of fun we 've sung a lot of rhymes and songs goodbye to everyone we waved goodbye like this we wave goodbye like this we clap my hands for all their friends we wave goodbye like this alright thanks for watching I 'll see you again bye _"

hear in everyday conversation your child is exposed to new and unusual words when you read books to them by reading a variety of books to your child you 're developing their vocabulary and preparing them to learn to read at kids today we 've got a great book and a fun activity and some nice songs and rhymes about boats duel like boats I like boats I even like being in boats just not out on the deep sea alright now what 's our first song you ready the Welcome song it 's toddler time sun shining it 's time for some fun it 's put a time sun shining welcome everyone yeah welcome hello and welcome to 12 the time now our first song you know this one one of my favorites you ready heads shoulders knees and toes knees and toes head shoulders knees and toes knees and toes and eyes and ears and toes now can we try that one again really fast you ready ready really really fast hey listen toes knees and toes head shoulders knees and toes knees and toes and eyes and ears and mouth head shoulders knees and toes knees and toes oh well done everyone you all did so well doing that fast now can we do another one of my favorites you know this one zoom zoom to the moon you ready zoom zoom zoom we 're going to the moon zoom zoom zoom we 're going very soon if you 'd like to take a trip climb aboard my rocketship Zoom Zoom Zoom we 're going to them five four three two one blast off can we do it again can we zoom zoom to the moon again all right let 's go zoom zoom zoom we 're going to the moon zoom zoom zoom we 're going very soon if you 'd like to take a trip climb aboard my rocketship zoom zoom zoom we 're going to the moon five four three two one blast off well done everybody now how about a I wiggle my shoulders I wiggle my nose now all the Wiggles out of me and I 'm as quiet as can be so you all know what we do after the wiggle run we do it book our book today is called who sank the boat by Pamela Allen do you know who sank the boat let 's see let 's see if we can figure it out so we 've got some hills a little house a jetty out into the water and a little boat there and then there 's somebody just walking along there beside the sea on mr. peppers place there lived a cow a donkey a sheep a pig and a tiny little mouse they were good friends and one warm sunny morning for no particular reason they decided to go for a row in the bay do you know who sank the boat you see them walking along there they 're walking along the jetty [Music] was it the cow who almost fell in when she tilted the boat and caused such a ding look look what do you think no it wasn who thinks about you can look she is tipping it a bit isn 't she sitting in the boat there was it the donkey who balanced her weight who yelled I 'll get in at the bow before it 's too late see the cow is sitting at the back of the boat that 's the stone the donkey is going to get into the front of the boat and that 's called the bow so what do you reckon was at the donkey you know it wasn 't the donkey who balanced her weight do you know who sank the boat see how nicely balanced it is now was it the pig as fat as butter who stepped in at the side and caused a great flutter Oh at the pig no it wasn 't the pig as fat as butter do you know who Ben who sank the boat that 's not looking too good it 's almost underwater was it the Sheep who knew where to sit to level the boat so that she couldn 't eat do you think it 's the Sheep she 's got level the boat what do you think no it wasn 't the Sheep who knew where to sit see they 're all in there evenly now getting pretty close to sinking though do you know who sank the boat was it the little mouse the last to get in the lightest of all could it be him if jumping in can you say that can see him then jumping in Judea that 's it the mouse you do know who sank the boat look at that look at them all in the water and a little mouse on the or up there [Applause] there they go all walking back looking very bedraggled and a little mouse running after them poor friends they all got a bit wet there didn 't they so how about they were gonna go for a row in the boat bay do you know how to row row row your boat shall we do that one ready row row row your boat gently down the stream merrily merrily merrily merrily life is but two dream your boat gently down the stream if you see a crocodile boat rock rock rock your boat quickly to the shore if you see your eye and don 't forget to roar ah well done everyone well done now how about can you make a sea with your hand like me this is the see the wavy see this is a boat and this is me all of the fishes way down below flutter their tails and away they go wanna do that one again that 's a lovely one this is the see the wavy see this is a boat and this is me all of the fishes way down below flatter their tails and away they go well done everyone well done now we 've got one more about a boat a lovely poem about an owl and a pussycat in a boat did you know that one The Owl and the Pussycat went to sea in a beautiful pea-green boat they took some honey and plenty of money wrapped up in a five pound moat the owl looked up to the stars above and he 's saying to a small guitar Oh lovely Oh my love what a lovely isn 't that a lovely one now how about we look at some different boats I 've got some lovely pictures of boats here these are two different boats this one you can see is open this one see how it 's closed over the legs these are both boats that you could see on our River and in fact these ones I see when I take my dogs to the dog beach down here this is called a canoe and this is a kayak sometimes I 've even seen people with their dogs sitting on the kayak so a canoe and a kayak you can see both of those around Perth this the fabulous picture this picture would be about a hundred years old and this is a canoe canoe this can be made out of all sorts of things this is an Australian Aboriginal man and he 's made his canoe from bark he 's very carefully peel bark from a tree and he has made a little command with it and they can push himself around on the water that clever now this boat this is boats definitely on the Swan River they often have always at the side or a little motor at the back and this kind of boat is called a dinghy can you say that it 's a funny word a dinghy now they often have oars and they often have a little motors but this is a cool picture and I 've seen this on the Swan River this is just a little boat like a dinghy but it 's got a sail and so when the wind catches the sail it will go really really fast and they race them you can see this some more there they 're racing but look what happens it starts to tip because of the wind so see how they 're leading out the side I 've seen them doing that on the Swan River on little dinghies with sails when they 're racing they make sure it doesn 't tip over by leading right out the side now this boat this is one of my favorite words for a boat this is called a catamaran I think because it has the word cat this boat is a catamaran it has two holes the hull is the bottom of the boat the bit that goes into the water so you can see one hole two hull that 's a catamaran this one would have sails and it would also have a motor but you can get them when they 're smaller just with sails and they 'll rest them like they did with that Dean now here 's another one that you would see of our ocean if you 're driving along the coast and you look here and you can see ships in the distance they 're big enormous ships like this with lots and lots of boxes full of stuff it 's called a freighter or a cargo ship they 're huge sometimes you can see them if you go down to Fremantle they 're coming to get unloaded or to get stuff loaded on now this one this is another really big boat this is a yacht now this yacht has a motor and it is huge you see all the rows of lights like one two three four and then a story on a house you know when you see a two-story house so this would be like a five story boat and I hope you can see it that little thing there under my finger is a helicopter this boat is big enough to land a helicopter on now this one is also a yacht you can see it 's a lot smaller and it 's only got sails and because of the way the sails are this yacht is called a sloop that 's a funny word that one sloop now this is a type of boat that you can see on the Swan River if you 're going over any of the bridges on the Swan River you can often see boats doing this it 's a speed boat it 's got a little motor there and you can see the fun 's coming the water because it 's going so fast very very fast as fast as cars those ones doing okay now we 'll look at some very old boats this boat these have been around for hundreds of years maybe thousands of years you this but I think you can get small ones with and they probably have motors on them now too and this boat is called wait for it a junk it 's not rubbish junk it 's a boat junk isn 't it cool I love the shape of the sails on a junk okay now this boat this is pretty impressive that is a very big boat you look at all the sails it 's got all over this boat a sailing ship and it 's called a schooner now this schooner is modeled on one that was called the end wrecked that came to Western Australia from Europe 400 years ago one of the first European boats to come to Australia looks like this schooner and the last one I 've got have any of you seen how to train your dragons gee no Vikings now Vikings aren 't around anymore and their boats aren 't around anymore but like a thousand years ago 2,000 years ago a sail some oars very long and carvings at each end and this was called a Viking longboat very obvious that one how 's that alright everyone that was pretty good how about we saw some interesting boats now we can do twinkle yep twinkle twinkle little star how I wonder what you are up above the world so high like a diamond in the sky twinkle twinkle little star how I wonder what you are now we 're almost done but before we go I 've got a great idea something that you guys can do at home you need some help from mom and dad look at this this is a milk carton this was a big thrill eater milk cotton and I cut out all of that you need mum or dad definitely have to do that bit if you do a 2 litre milk carton you just cut this spit out and if you 've got a cardboard milk carton that will still work you just cut one strip out then if we don 't cut out I made a sale from and a little masked enough just sticky taped it on I 've put some blue tack in each corner here and that is ballast ballast is you put this in the bath I 've got Daphne duck if I pop her in there and I get William whale shark and I pop him in how 's that they can go for a sail in a boat maybe you can give that a go today would that be fun do you reckon and you can keep that in your bath that will last for ages in the bath and be good fun well almost done now I hope we see you again soon and now it 's time for our goodbye song okay now our time is we 've had a lot we 've sung a lot two rhymes and songs good bye to everyone we wave goodbye like this we wave goodbye like this which left patterns for all our friends we wave goodbye like these _"

    "text": "and it 's my pleasure to introduce Anthony robot of them the development side the general manager of development wa4 lend-lease lend-lease of course the people that manage the largest shopping center here in Western Australia of course we know it to be the best shopping center as well neil gerard otherwise known as jerry the president of the journal up businesses association is also a local business operator and last but minor no means least gavin hignett founder and chair of gavin hug me property a member of the CEO of city of journal up doodle up stakeholder group and owner of a number of properties here in the city some of you have submitted questions ladies and gentlemen and we will endeavor to try to deal with the number of those the the approach will be to ask each of the panel members to input and we 'll see as many see how many questions we can actually get through first of all I 'll start with you Anthony if I might can you share an example of how covert has impacted your business organization and the sector lend-lease is a global business so it 's had its eyes on many many experiences around the world over the last three months and those experience has acquired varied even right across Australia when you can see variations in the experience in how lend-lease can adapt to those experiences locally but it 's been it 's been foremost in the businesses mind about health and well-being for everyone it works with its tenants and also it 's its team members and so we 've taken that on board and I think one thing that we 've considered and we can see trending through the world and mark made mention of it is innovation in workplace and it 's something that has definitely been accelerated over the last three months and the use of technology and that is eased the pressure on business in continuing to stay open quite considerably Gerry could I ask you to deal with the same question if you might but from your particular perspective as the president the local businesses Association which is essentially small business and also as a relatively small business operator yourself yeah just having to deal with working from home downsizing hibernation and working through what the different issues are for your business every industry has been impacted differently every industry has got some level of uncertainty and having to work through that and Gavin if I might pose the same question to you from someone who gives advice in the in the in the Commerce field in particular in terms of investment and property development yeah thanks Gary and in a very small way I do a lot of talk so in public and I 've had you know crowds of people in rooms that 's now off the agenda and now we 're doing things like webinars like what we 're here today so if I 'm rusty on webinar skills today I apologize up front for that so that 's just one small example how I communicate with the people who so with the information the research that I have and how do I get that across so that people can make better informed decisions that 's one example I know many businesses will be faced with the same what are some of the strategies that you 've put in place in your organization particularly in relation to the supply chain during this particular period yes so the the big thing is the the the fact that we haven 't been able to meet it 's definitely the social media the zooms working from home making sure that you 're still able to meet with your suppliers discuss with them and communicate with them getting your message across has been a big part and having to pivot on ways that you would normally do things tour groups and things like that in the small business that would normally have face-to-face they 're having to do things online social medias webinars much like Gavin said Gavin have you had to adapt your business model because of the covert 19 I mean you 're very personable individual we have a lot of interaction with people what 's been the change for you yeah well I suppose if I could answer that question by not answering you Gary in the sense that one thing that is that is common in the business are in the business we 're all affected in the same way and what I 've found is very quickly you work out who can you who you can really rely on and who steps up in times of change and who doesn 't and it 's sort of a bit of a sifting process but an exam if you like and and so therefore I know that there 's certain people within the organization that I can rely on and now I do more so than ever and I think that it gives me great hope because it doesn 't all come back to me and there 's many other people there that can actually do the things that are necessary to create the new future business which is not replicate the past but to create the new opportunities in the changes because change always equals opportunity how do you capitalize on that I don 't have to come up with every answer to that now because I know there 's certain individuals there that didn 't really do it better than what I can so Anthony from your land lease experience I think you 're right Gavin I think you know the ability to find out who you want to be doing business with will come to the top and I think that comes with the transparency and the way that you communicate and not only internally with your your business groups or your internal silos or however you want to structure your business but also your customers as well and we 've found that a lot of our customer facing businesses have had to look at different ways of coping with covert and isolation measures but you have to really step out of your comfort zone from some time ago it 's interesting um and you know it will have different businesses that we operate in different ways and affects everyone differently I noticed there 's quite a few tourism businesses that are tourism operators owners that are registered today and yet I look at the inbound tourism where 's that gone domestic tourism from other states gone but we is a country lose twenty billion dollars every year to outbound tourism so we actually have more the people within the state to come and see me and how do I cultivate those out inbound tourists which are not coming today which might be coming next year or the year after how do I give them that experience and cultivate it so when the borders open then they know about me and I think there 's the opportunities that are really staring us right in the face right now that we need to do things differently what we 've done because there 's plenty of business there if we can actually change the way we do things and capture it it 's an energy comment you make because we 've just done three online videos of operators in the tourism sector and and it 's been really really impressive perhaps Jerry if I can ask you from your perspective what was the one of the key take outs for you from from the presentation that mark made around the data and the analytics that have been provided yeah the the big takeaway ID from mark was the varied recovery states of different industries and how hospitality is the heat that 's coming through now and that 's you know you with these stimulus packages that are coming out and all the the the government 's help that we 're getting and relying on at the moment how they 're going to phase that through because people are filling out different times if I might enter you move the the question along terms there was a comment from mark about national cyber attacks which has been very very focused in the last few days of course we are the cyber hub not only of Western Australia but Australia here with the Edith Cowan University so in terms of those recent reports in the critical aspects of infrastructure in your business what is Lindley 's having to do with its customers and its tenants in terms of cyber security I think starting with the lend-lease workforce first and foremost is considerable training we 've undertaken a lot of training to get insights and to develop mechanisms and systems to best avoid any cyber effects and it 's something that we share with our businesses that we do business with best way but it is a very very common and dangerous position that we could be in if we don 't take up that training and that knowledge particularly as we move to a more high-tech communication base with various methods of communicating or meeting virtually so we 're opening ourselves up to being vulnerable if we 're not careful Jerry in terms of both your business and the myriad of small operators that you represent how are you encouraging them to take the cybersecurity issues is very very serious oh very very serious the thing with the cyber is that it 's everyone 's responsibility it 's not just the business owners responsibility all the staff members that have an email social media zooms everything is accessible from there so I mean the there 's organizations around that are providing very good education and tuition on how to be cyber safe making sure that you 've got things in place in your business policies you know I think it 's cool it was slight but check me as I think is the ECU 's platform and I think it sure that they 're safe Kevin we talked a little earlier about how you 've changed your business model because of having to use technology and it 's a very personable one-to-one business in lots of ways what have you had to do in that cyber security space yeah I suppose it 's revisit the purpose while you 're in business in a sense that I 'm my role in business and one the key purpose of the business is to help people make better informed decisions so then I don 't get wedded to a particular channel I get wedded to a purpose and I suppose I want to encourage any business owner to come back to why you aren 't why are you in business and what is it that drives you and come back to that purpose rather than the mediums or the channels or the things that you 've been using through repetition and so hence I use different mechanisms and helping people make better decisions I 'm finding myself a lot on the phone these days I 'm texting a lot I 'm putting out reading stats and researching and and and and that 's providing people with more information make better informed decisions one thing I would say is that you know in this world we 're supposed to always hadn 't be experts on a on a virus individually and we 'll get around the table and we 'll chat about it we all you know become self it experts one of my rules for the for the year ahead that I 've implemented is to only talk to people who know what they 're talking about so I 'm not an expert in the virus I can 't advise you on that but in property that 's one my expertise find the people in the areas that you need for your business drive forward and talk to people who know because they can assist you so if I could just push you a little further with from lend-lease in in terms of the supply chains and the approach to business both now as we come out of the will the post what we call post covert period and then of course there we go forward and there in particular issues that came out of Marc 's presentation that you think particularly relevant or probably more so around our construction business I think Gary that that 's the the big issue or businesses who we may operate with relying on other supply chains that 's something that obviously we need to consider when sourcing product and and items for our businesses but it 's it is something that we have considered in our procurement methodology and it 's something that we look at in all of our projects prior to commencing that procurement methodology and in in terms of your particular area Gary any changes that you need to make to the procurement and the supply chain for both yourself and the businesses that you represent I just think it mean you 've got to maintain the lines of communication I think that 's the biggest part and an understanding which industries are actually declining and what the impact of that 's going to be further down the line and actually pre projecting out what 's what to expect okay what I 'd of pursuing a little in relation to the role of academia business and and the overall economic recovery and I 'll start with you first Gavin in terms of the government 's put out various things at the moment some of which are being embraced very quickly but there 's a lot of conversation about what happens in September when a lot of these things start to cease under the current arrangement yeah I think for businesses at the moment you 've got most of your staff being paid for by job keeper if you 're in if you 're in damage control that 's given you a window of opportunity to actually do something and if you and if you sit by on your hands you think was in this great you 're missing the opportunities presented to you and September is a scary thought so September really for those that you can make some changes it becomes secondary or almost irrelevant so while some of us is paying your wages bill use it and do something about it secondly you know everyone 's got some sort of plans business which you know if I G you know I could always do this or I could do that and there 's certain opportunities to present it now is the time to make those real rather than just having them sit in the bottom drawer so find the people that you can rely on use this opportunity where you 're funded for a period of time and get cracking because we will be in a different world this time next year and growth and opportunities come just ask anyone who didn 't buy under the share market or in the lows of the share market in the Senate increase how you feeling now fear of missing out don 't be the same way in your business get cracking do things now don 't have fear of missing out when September comes that you haven 't used this opportunity jury from your point of view in terms of government and academia because the academia is a big issue for us here in yeah absolutely I mean there 's the programs that are out they 've been made one of the big statement to the jba was used this time much like Evan said but learn there 's always things that you 've been intending to do you need to go and learn there 's places that you can go you can go to the TAFE you can go to ECU there 's postgraduate courses that you can do you can get onto the business ready program you can get onto the business engagement program for assistance there 's all of these things out there and for those businesses that are you know in hibernation you 've got the time available so it 's the NASA time to use it and in the case of lend-lease which is more of a top end of town in terms of the size of the business and the magnitude of the business but a lot of your tenants are very very small operators but I think the key Geary 's certainly from a lend-lease perspective is business planning and it 's very much what you 're talking about Gavin and Jerry you know you 've got to have a view of where we 're going for that knowing that the world has changed compared to our three months so it 's completely different dynamics and being resilient in that time but I think what we 've seen and what has surprised a few people is the reaction by government to collaborate and all levels of government to collaborate to try and set the tone for where we will be toward the end of the year be a housing stimulus planning reform or reviews of DA 's and trying to ear my shovel-ready projects that 's that form of collaboration I don 't think I 've seen between business and government for 35 years well probably well that 's as long as I 've been working anyway Gary so I think it 's tremendous that business and certainly government have been able to get together and and pave a way forward for everyone I 've been around a little bit longer than you I 've never seen it I started work in 1971 and I 've been through a myriad of different employment programs I 've never seen the level of cooperation and conversation honest conversation that you actually have to use debt for a while to drive the economy to get back to where we need to be Jerry there 's a question that 's come through what are some of the long and short term priorities the dual of business associate it sounds like a free kick to me but go for it a bit of a selling point here now so short term plans we want to get our events back up and running one of our main pillars of the the jba is to network and refer and the biggest opportunity to do that is when we 're actually back to face-to-face you know just bumping or by bumping you know our local and business businesses around long term we want to get back into a place where we can start to you know celebrate and get awards going on and we want to be able to advocate and start working with the city in actually getting some of these plans and these new sort of red tape things that get thrown around and parking and we want to have those discussions can start to progress how we can grow small business so given if we can pursue with you in terms of the next three to six months the the property market in particular there 's lots of money about extending leases requirements to look after your tenant etc what 's your prognosis for the next six to twelve months in the property sector yeah well I think it was a leading leading decision to come in and and for landlords and tenants to come together and negotiate on rent and negotiate on on a pause in rent for those that needed because I think at the end of the day they both share the same thing they 're both trying to survive and and I think that unites rather rather than divides but things are opening up people are moving people are spending and people are starting to do things they 're out and about and it you know people are either going to come out of lockdown feared or excited somewhat and I reckon the general public 's coming out and they 're looking for things to do and know from my point of view and in the business you know one thing that 's revealed to me in this downturn is the property is important to me but people are more important and maybe it 's because it 's a health issue or maybe it 's because I 'd really didn 't grow a business I grew Pete _"

    "text": "hi my name is Julie hall share and I 'm from wiring kids I 'll be discussing tips for sleep for toddlers and preschool today I will weave the science behind sleep and nutrition into the presentation just look at this photo for us 2nd toby is reading the night story to his sister Isabel this is their family tradition every family sleep traditions rituals are unique in what we do so what to expect between 15 and 18 months our toddler transitions from two sleeps a day to one sleep this may be challenging for mums and dads as they don 't know until the morning if their child is going to need one sleep or to sleep sometimes our some time after your child reaches to your child may try and break out of having a day neck all together however a toddler or preschooler still needs to have downtime during the day so encourage your child to rest in their rooms for an hour after lunch or lie on the couch with no TV on but may have a toy to get some more energy up and child will feel secure as the parents and caregivers are responsive to their needs most of the time during the toddler years children may still have separation awareness and be clinging at times this phase may only last a few days or weeks if it lasts longer talk to your child health nurse and get some strategies research tells us a lot of children in the toddler and Beyond years and they protest about going to bed but we know our children have about 12 hours sleep a night regardless frightening dreams start to occur at about 00 and peak between 3 6 we know children 's imagination increases during this time so the dreams are very vivid so look at what your child is reading the book books like um because maybe totally suitable for their age group but they may be one in a hundred children that finds the book stressful or they worry about it or find out what 's happened in Early Learning Center during the day because that may cause the vivid dreams or they may have seen something on TV so think about why too hot have you got them layer dress with too many clothes on think about there 's some of the reasons why we had these bigger dreams so sleeping context it 's gorgeous little boy Harry is got an amazing imagination he 's obviously camping with a tent in the lounge room and he 's obviously cooking having a barbecue or something like that right now for health-wise it 's your child will have they got a cold have they gotten upper respiratory tract infection have they got allergies or any other medical conditions they may interfere with their sleep we can 't start changes while a child is unwell children will be getting their 18-month our teeth and their two-year-old molars will be coming through at during this period of time very normally around your issue for a couple of days each after that if they strip your children are still waiting it then can become a habit hereditary ask your mother or your partner 's mother what type of sleepers you both were as researchers at some Insomnia 's outer edit area also know that some children may issue can be a familiar and could affect your children sleep so consult your doctor if you 're concerned that this is the reason your child is having broken sleep temperament peoplement is how a child reacts to situations and stimuli this includes their moods their ability to calm themselves as well as how active they may may be what type of temperament does your child have are they laid-back are they children that need a lot more work to get them to sleep ages and stages developmentally your child 's brain is undergoing significant developmental changes in the second and third year of life children start to protest about sleep particularly at night and around 18 months but that will change over time we know toddlers need at least one hour a day of outdoor play and preschoolers need two hours of physical activity outdoors this is to blow up steam and then they become tired we know the outdoor play boosts our endorphins that 's our happy molecules and also increases dopamine and serotonin and this all helps our children sleep better Satomi again he 's learning to lean muscles so children are learning through their senses what is your child hearing about sleep from you does your voice sound like it 's party time or do we sound scary or does our voice mean it is big time kind of that voice sound it needs to be boring and straight to the point it is bedtime now mummy loves you good night this is what a child needs to hear from their parents what is your child 's scene is he seeing you looking anxious as we know three-year-olds can read every emotion on their parents flat face do you look confident about your child going to sleep because that 's what he needs to see what is your charm feeling about sleep he 's he overwhelmed due to tiredness has he had a rough day and does he just need time with his parents for a cuddle before bed and really winding him down what have you taught your child about sleep has he been taught that he can 't go to bed and they sure in bed with you has he been taught that if and bring him out again so we have to think about are these sustainable what we are currently doing with our child because our child is learning from us about your child 's will the sleep environment if your child 's room too busy is it too noisy is it too light is it too cold all of these can 't impact on our child 's sleeping milestones we know that children sleep cycles have matured by the time they 're into their second year of life so they are 45 minutes to 60 minutes but we also know that children are fighting for independence during the toddler and preschool ages and their favorite word is no some parents think their child should move to a bed during this stage I think that we should leave our children in their cots for as long as possible because at least we will keep them in bed unless they are climbing out then you have no other alternative but to move them into a bed we also know that toddlers don 't eat a lot in the second year of life they that they are practicing the skills that they are currently learning continuously even in this Lee nutrition the second year of life food becomes the most important nutrition for your child and we know that they only require six hundred mils of milk a day or dairy and we also know that children get very tired and they often refuse to eat so if that 's your child try offering them the meat and veggies which needs more chewing in the morning for breakfast and the mushy food for dinner at night sleep so see Asians you know are a sustainable is what we 're doing sustainable for life or do we need to make changes to a sleep associations to get our child to sleep I 've talked about separation awareness language but just increases massively in the second year of life as a second or third year of life and we start to need to use open-ended questions with our children the carers children learn what each Kara does for different rituals and routine you know grandma does something different from early learning center and then they do children are learning from their parents that we are all different Todd signs what is your child 's time signs children are all individuals but when they become overtired it is more challenging to calm them down and to get to sleep children in the second year of life later in the second year of life start to have tantrums and get very frustrated with things they also when they are tired they don 't want to eat they just whinge that 's perfectly normal so the types of sleep there are two types of sleep one is the rapid eye movement which we call the REM sleep we 're toddlers practice what they are learning during the daytime in their sleep and so they do repetition repetition repetition so if they are learning to walk 12 months they will be walking if they are learning to make animal sounds they will be making animal sounds around 18 months of age like it might be a cook of our that type of noise and in about three to three and a half they are practicing negotiations you 'll so you not doing that you think who 's in the house but it is just your child practicing the non REM sleep is the very deep sleep this is when the body repairs itself regrowth tissue builds muscles and bones and it is more difficult to wake a child in this very deep sleep we do know true this deep asleep for children and for us too is before midnight so the earlier you get your child to bed the better so we have longer time in the non REM sleep before midnight and we do it any other time during the night toddler sleep patterns we know that children their sleep is before midnight which I 've actually said so we need to think about getting our children to sleep earlier rather than later so and I know that can be a challenge if they 're at Early Learning Center and you 're at work and picking them up and having some downtime but making sure you 've got a ritual and a routine is really important for helping your child may manage that we also know that we need to lay addressed and put them in a sleeping bag as they won 't be able to keep any big clothes on until they 're about four so we need to make sure we are layer dressing our toddler to keep them warm and we do know that toddlers don 't sleep very well if they don 't have any food in their stomach so it is important that we try to give them food before they go to sleep we know at night that the stomach doesn 't move very much it 's like ask don 't appear Celtic movement hardly occurs so that 's why we don 't get hungry in the middle of the night so what we need to be looking at is consolidating our short child sleep cycles and teaching them to go back to sleep such as we have 45 to 60 minutes and mature sleep cycle II is for a child and we 've got to try to meet those sleep cycles so we go 60 minutes link it to another sleep cycle of 45 minutes link it to another sleep cycle of put yourself back to sleep in the middle of the night you need to teach your child to be able to do that so questions to consider are you ready to make challenge that is the most important thing are you ready to make change and what is your plan so some strategies that we have out there I 'm making small realistic changes are more achievable for most of us than big changes what do I mean by that if your chance having difficulty going to sleep we deal with that first once we 've achieved that we move to the first whitening of the night and we work hard to get our children to go back to sleep we may borrow a book from the library so that we are starting to teach our children to go to sleep there are lots of sleep books out there for children that you can read their children 's books not adult books of how you do it but it tells the story of going to sleep if you 've got a preschooler that is temperament wise is going to sleep we 're actually going to sleep we also know that rituals and routines are so important in a child 's life and change takes time so if we are breastfeeding or bottle feeding we need to breastfeed in another room other than the bedroom before bed and if we bottle fed feeding or giving it baby a toddler a drinking a cup we need to do this thing clean the teeth as we know that the milk light remains on the teeth and causes decay so parenting as a team I love this photo how did this happen this is what steps saying about Harry how did it happen in there you don 't have to be on the same page as your partner but you need to be had the same parenting goals your child already knows what both parents do however to discuss your plan with the other carers grandparents Early Learning Center 's is really important when you 're making changes and I suggest that you most probably think about making the change but if you have the weekend off starting on a Thursday night move through and then slowly move through pushing a little a little bit each week to achieve the final goals so today we 've covered a lot on sleep I just want to say enjoy the ride there 's no right and wrong way of doing sleep but remember to be persistent and consistent you will have setbacks as your child gets sick or you go on a holiday or a major change happens but just implement the changes again and you will achieve enjoy your baby and your child _"

    "text": "hi and welcome my name is Julie hull share and I 'm from wiring kids today we 'll be discussing tips for baby sleep in the fourth trimester you cannot separate sleep from feeding so I will be weaving information about feeding into this presentation as well as sleep this is beautiful baby Heidi here asleep in the photo and she can see she is wrapped this is what we call swaddled and why do we need to swaddle babies is because they are born with the startle reflex and the startle reflex means if they get a fright their arms flail so we like to put their little hands close to their chest and to swaddle them so that they are feeling cocooned in the fourth trimester so what to expect each baby is unique each set of parents are unique and the parents need to learn from their babies what their babies need does your baby need to be fed does your baby need to be coddled does your baby need a nappy changed parents are learning up from babies what they need so if we look at glamorous after a long labor and dad looks absolutely exhausted but baby Heidi needs to feed frequently so she needs to have somewhere between 6 to 12 feeds in a 24-hour period but we also know that her sleep is irregular and she will sleep in blocks from 20 minutes to 4 hours in a 24-hour period so mums and dads ah don 't get the normal sleep that they have had but we know mums of being prepared for this broken sleep in the third trimester so mums have to be patient because she 's just not learning to breastfeed baby 's also learning to feed as well so it 's a you have to learn to do that tandem together babies also need mums and dads to calm them to help settle them and to help them go to sleep so it is really important that during this trimester you particularly care for each other as you both get quite tired babies learn about the world through their senses this gorgeous photo here of Heidi looking at us wondering who we are where do we fit what is senses or these are all the senses that we have ever so it the first five senses you 're quite familiar with but the two at the bottom you may not be but I am going to talk about and go through each sensor the sense of smell when your baby is in the crook of the arm they can smell what do don 't you have on they quickly learn that mum smells like this dad smells like that grandma may smell like this and they memorize that smell that goes into the brain and that 's hardwired in very quickly that that 's the smell of my parents hearing babies have been listening to Mum and dad 's voice throughout the last few months of the pregnancy so they find that voice very calming taste when a baby takes milk from the breast the taste buds are absolutely stimulated because breast milk absolutely changes in taste and every feed depending on what mum has been eating beside baby is looking intently at your face trying to connect the hearing with the smell with the sight so they are is really smiling back saying I love you too so touch baby has learned in utero about this is mum 's touch this is dad 's touch this might be baby brothers touch which is a hope in there so that when you hold babies they are very calmed at you and they are learning to connect what you smell like with what you you 're doing touch why 's the movement and balance sense is a sense when you rock baby you are aiding your baby to learn about space awareness and this helps your baby with their posture and muscle tone so every time you rock baby and babies love to be Brock this is helping this sense to to develop so the body awareness sense is when your baby is learning where their limbs are and what they can do with their limbs so in the first um first 10 to 11 weeks baby will move their hand towards their face they 'll poke their finger in their eye and then by the time they had 12 weeks they are learning to get some control of that and forwards in front of their eyes so sleeping context what does this mean well all the things play a part in helping your baby go to sleep and your baby 's health is a part of that so you know what type of delivery did your baby have you know what type of birth did they have not done every mom does the delivery baby does the best so what type of birth did baby have were they a preemie baby you know all of these can have play a part in how your baby is sleeping hereditary ask your partner 's mum ask your mum what type of sleepers you both were you know did were there any sleep issues that she was aware of in each family that may be hereditary the same with temperament we need to ask that too and ages and stages of development in the first 12 weeks the baby 's development is getting to know you they are starting to smile at about 6 weeks and then about 12 weeks as I said they 'll be moving their hand backwards and forwards on with your baby in that fourth trimester attachment we all worry at times about whether we are attached to our baby the way we should be if this concerns you please talk to your child health nurse or your doctor about your feelings we do know as long as baby has one carry parent in their lives who detachment is occurring the types of sleep there are two types of sleep the REM sleep and the non REM sleep but let 's just focus on the REM sleep for a minute this is the very light sleep this is where babies are practicing what they 're learning in their sleep so whatever your baby is learning at the moment is what they will be practicing in their sleep so they do repetition repetition you know when they 're smiling you 'll watch them smile in their sleep when they 're moving their hands purposely you 'll watch them moving their hands in their sleep the non REM sleep is the very deep sleep this is sleep where babies where we all do is repair and regrow tissue and build during this very deep sleep it is very hard to wake babies up and so when we are trying to wake babies up is a challenge it 's just like when you get kicked in the middle of the night by your partner who says the baby 's crying and you go who 's baby what baby because you are in such a deep sleep you didn 't cry so tired signs every baby 's tired signs are unique and we really have to observe our babies to learn about their tired signs so no baby does all of these they do it a few of these or they may do 70% of these signs for tired signs so this baby is yawning and we 've also got the fists clenched in there in this photo so we do know that if your baby is crying because they 're tired you have missed tired signs so what does that cry sounds like it sounds like a cry you might do when you 're sitting on the couch and you go to sleep but I want to watch the end of can 't go to sleep same thing happens to baby you have to wait for the next cycle to come around so if they are if you 've missed that cycle to get your baby to sleep so please watch the cues for your baby 's tired signs and then pop your baby into bed and help them go to sleep so the feed sleep what we know about this is if babies are getting less than average sleep in a 24-hour period we need to really watch their tired signs and then help them go back to sleep will go to sleep and then when they wake up after a sleep cycle help them go back to sleep by rocking or patting to sleep so that we can try and help baby increase the amount of sleep they 're having in a 24-hour period feeding sometimes babies just have short feeds and don 't want anymore and then you pop them down and and rock them and they go to sleep and then they wake up a few minutes later we need to try to wake babies up to able to go back to sleep how long is a good feed every baby is unique so some babies may take 40 minutes some babies may only take 10-15 minutes to feed crying babies we do know that crying increases during the six to twelve week period and the crying increases up to two to three hours a day this is normal your baby isn 't sick it is perfectly normal development so you have to look at some strategies that you can do to help your baby when they are crying and this might be to give baby a bath to rock baby to take baby for a walk or to put baby in the sea position that we call it or fetal position reading the back of the head goes into your cleavage and then baby 's little legs are drawn up so they 're in a fetal position and this puts that legs pressure on their tummy so that they can pass wind or have a fart or they can have a burp but every baby cries and please look at some ways for you to stay too much but baby down and walk away have a glass of water and then come back to baby so some strategies that we might be able to implement is babies don 't need too many play times in the first eight weeks being held by parents and bathe in language is play for your baby because your baby is getting to know you however when you observe those time I had signs decrease the stimulation no TV change the tone of your voice to be dull and boring and to be able to wrap baby up and to put baby down in the cot so that they are able to go to sleep what baby wants from parents is to be persistent and consistent with their settling so not do lots of different things try just do one thing and use the same cues about going to sleep such as you might sing the same song when it comes to to just sleep time in a dull boring voice that might be baa baa black sheep have you any more it doesn 't matter what song you 're singing to to let your baby know it is sleep time so parenting as a team it 's very important that you really take care of each other and talk about what your heart says and listen to what do you both talk to each other and say what does my baby really want from us if you have family around and you are finding it quite tiring to ask for help but the help isn 't a whole baby unless you want them to hold baby help is to be able to do the washing the ironing the cooking the cleaning this allows you to care and get to know your baby you babies need your help to learn to feed settle and sleep enjoy your baby it isn 't a race to get your baby to sleep it is a race to get to know your baby thank you _"

    "text": "morning and welcome my name is Julie hole share and I 'm from wiring kids and I 'll be discussing tips for sleep for babies four to twelve months old today I want to take a second for you to look at this photo of cliff he 's asleep in the pram parents have different sleeping arrangements for their children at different times during the day Tiff 's a mum has a three-year-old so she does a lot of settling of cliff in the pram and then she moves cliff once he 's asleep from from the room where she settled he in the family room into his own room so she 's not disturbing three-year-olds_._47.379 play so what to expect well gorgeous Alex here is certainly telling us he is tired but what we do know and what to expect from what research tells us that babies need to have somewhere between 15 to 16 hours in a 24 hour period but don 't panic if your baby only gets 10 hours in 24 hours as you can work to help your baby increase the amount of sleep they figures we also know baby may need somewhere between five plus fees at 12 months of age and we also know that each baby is unique and each baby is an individual so it 's important to write down what you are noticing with your baby sleep wake cycles as well as the deserving babies body language so you are learning more about the changes occurring and baby 's development and it 's important to discuss what you are noticing with your partner so you are both being on the same page we know babies start to spend more time awake during the day as they get older and they start to let pen let 's know that they like to be held a lot more and be with their parents constantly separation awareness starts at about nine months but some babies will start this earlier you will notice that your baby will go to only you today where yesterday they were happy to go to Grandma this separation awareness comes and goes through the first year of baby 's life babies learn about the world through their senses baby balloons you will also notice your baby 's hand-eye coordination is improving however let us talk about the senses and sleep a baby is learning about the tone of your voice your soothing tones make your baby stop crying but they also pick up the excitement in your voice so that means playtime so when it means bedtime be consistent and have a voice that they recognized you mean sleep this is a dull boring voice we also know at this time everything goes into your baby 's mouth so if they have a dummy for sleep they may start to lose this as they go from the deep asleep to the light sleep so you need to be teaching your babies how to find their dummy and put their dummy back in their mouth if that you can 't do that you may need to think about removing the dummy altogether from four months to twelve months sometimes they are very babies are very fussy with their feeding they pull off look around go back on the breast it is really important though if you have one of these dull and boring with the feed so that your baby is able to go to bed with a full tummy moving in balance your babies are learning where their body is so they will be rolling around at four months this can be frightening for your baby as they roll over on their tummy and they don 't know how to get back the same with standing they often don 't know how to sit down so you have to practice these skills during their play time during this rolling around they also can get trapped with their limbs through the railing so do try and teach your baby to move their limbs back from the edge of the railings sleeping context this is about the things that wraparound sleep to make us good sleepers or not to good sleepers so I want you to consider these health if your child has an upper respiratory tract infection they 're not going to be sleeping very well people will tell you teasing causes sleep issues research shows that teething issues are only a problem for one to two nights per tooth partner 's mother and your mother what type of sleepers were you and your siblings and are there anything in the family that may interfere with my baby 's sleep the temperament also ask your partner 's mother and your mother about your temperament in there as we know genetics can play a part in baby needing more help with settling and sleep than other babies attachment babies are born to engage with people the don 'ts between a baby and their parent is a delight to watch as they talk cuddle kiss however not all parents enjoy being with their baby if you are one of these parents talk to your child health nurse or doctor about your feelings your babies world safe sleeping babies once they start to roll around the cot at four months they need to be placed in a sleeping bag to sleep not swaddled remembering babies cannot keep big clothes on and talero about four so we need to lay address them if they want a toy please give them a toy that is size the right size and not too big and not 've talked about will be going through different milestones at this time so what are those milestones that we expect our babies to be do the physical ones the the rolling the crawling the standing the slowest type of milestones we will be expecting our baby to and they practice these milestones in their sleep so brain development we certainly know babies brains are developing rapidly and they are practicing what they are learning during their their sleep so they 're connecting your own to newer and nutrition and growth you will hear people say give your baby a some solids they 'll sleep better that is a myth completely babies won 't sleep better milk is the most important nutrition for your child in the first year of life tastes and textures is all solids are but we do know your baby needs to follow the curve and by following the curve on the graph and if your baby gets sick they will drop below the curve and they will want to feed more frequently we do know sleep associations [Music] what is the sleep association and is it babies will feed their babies to sleep some babies will pack their babies to sleep some babies will drive from Joondalup to the city and back again to get their babies to sleep are they sustainable no we have to have sleep associations that are sustainable long-term we 've talked about separation awareness and language it 's really important that you bathe your baby in language so talking to your baby but also looking at their faces and pausing allowing your baby to respond back so tired signs tired science what is your child 's signalling to you or showing you that they are tired these are some of the tide science that children have but I will be the first to say each baby is unique and each baby will have different tired signs but we do know the grizzling and the crying is a light side and if that happens it 's much harder to get babies to sleep because we 've missed the tired signs and we have to wait for the next sleep cycle to come round same as us watching TV at night we winch want to see the end of the program then we go to bed and we can 't sleep because we 've missed those tired sighs and so we have to wait for the next sleep time to come round so the types of sleep there are two types of sleep there 's the rapid eye movement sleep and there 's the non REM sleep the rapid eye movement sleep is where babies practise what they are learning during the day so whatever skill they 're learning during the day this is what they 'll be practicing in this light sleep and we do know that babies spend about fifty percent of their time in each sleep as we get older it decreases so we spend as adults more in our non REM sleep the non REM sleep is the very deep sleep where the body repairs itself rigorous tissue and builds muscle and bones we also know that your baby immunity increases during this thing we know babies like us are more difficult to wake in this very deep sleep baby sleep patterns what do we know about baby sleep 16 hours in a 24-hour period we know that they have now have blocks of sleep up to 5 hours and that 's what we want at night so we don 't let our babies sleep more than about 3 to 4 hours during the day because we want them to have long to sleep at night we also know that babies still need to have somewhere between 5 to to 12 feeds in a 24 hours so they have to be fitted in somewhere in that period of time we also know babies may cause signaling during the night they may need they do need to be still fed during the night on the whole so what do we need to change you 've written down what needs to be changed and then you need to discuss it with your partner what we can achieve early change alright and once you 've decided on what can be you can change and you have to work out when you can implement it that suits the family you know changing jobs going on a holiday may not be the perfect time and both members of the family or for all three members of the family must be well to be able to do this strategies baby Hardy here has started to roll so her mum has now placed her in a sleeping bag but is a sleep sleep recommendation as she prefers to sleep her on the tummy and as you can notice she just has a small sleep association and it 's her little giraffe in the cot with her so it 's not too small not too big so what 's your family ritual if you 're picking your child up from Early Learning Centre you need to have time to reconnect with your baby you also need to have some dinner with your baby it 's some quiet time and then have a bath and a feed and then to bed you know so what is the rituals that you have in the family around sleep because these are what you are trying to build these superhighways in your child 's brain around your good rituals baby has the right to protest and parents have the right to please only do so until baby 's eyes close and then hold they will cry repeat keep doing this because we need to be teaching your baby to go to sleep once we 've achieved teaching our baby to go to sleep we then may need to teach our baby to mean sleep cycles together that 's what our aim is in the first year of life that 's what your parents taught you and you have to teach your baby the same parenting as a team babies thrive when parents work as a team and share the same goal it is hard making change so be supportive of each other during implementation only implement change when as I 've said earlier when the whole family is well and ready to make those changes I hope these tips will assist you and your baby sleep sleep better and you enjoy being a parent thank you _"

    "text": "hello and welcome to the city of joondalup libraries special school holiday session this session is all about the magic of music my name is Ruth and I love listening to all different types of music and I love playing music too and making it at home music is really really powerful do you know it can help us to tell stories even when there are no words in the story music can also make us feel different types of emotions so different types of classical music and different types of ways that they play the music can make us feel and change our moods so some music can make us feel happy and some music can make us feel really sad some music can calm us down like lullabies and some music can make us feel really really energetic and it 's really important for children to be able to understand their emotions and to be able to name and label what they 're feeling now music is sometimes more important than words and more powerful than words in expressing what we feel inside I would like to share about how different types of classical music can help us to feel different types of emotions now this little boys called Allegro and that 's the title of the book and Allegro is a little boy who 's trying to practice playing the piano but he 's very very frustrated he can 't seem to make sense of all the dots on the page which are all the musical notes but as he starts to practice and practice he starts to realize that the notes are actually like magic and they take him on an amazing adventure Allegro a magical journey through 11 musical masterpieces written by David miles and illustrated by Aneta buggy gyani one rainy afternoon Allegro set of the old family piano he was blink trying to bunk practice his latest bunk piece but saw him it just wasn 't going well I hate this music Allegro said he crumpled it up into a tiny ball and threw it on the floor there it laid like a pale dot against the dark wood but dots are funny things because if they grow lines and more lines and you to magical places away allegro went carried off on the sounds of enchanting melodies he danced with the favors of wind tossed ships [Music] he walked in the fragrant meadows of morning 's first light [Music] and he explored the shores of Uncharted lands [Music] [Music] some melodies were sad and made his heart ache [Music] me [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] some melodies were triumphant and made his heart swell [Music] [Applause] [Music] at times he wanted to dance a jig [Music] [Music] at times he wanted to March and see [Music] and at the best of times he wanted to stand up and shout me joy I am Allegro [Applause] [Music] [Music] and then slyly slowly like the dimming light of the Setting Moon the music faded [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] an Allegro was back home it was still time to practice so he did and he did and he did [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] what an amazing book that was I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did the music that we heard in that book was a selection of really by an orchestra so how did the composers create an emotion or a feeling or a mood in their music well there 's a few things they can use different types of instruments because different instruments produce different sounds some instruments are very light and fluttery and high like a flute whereas other musical instruments are very gravely and bacey like a tuba or a double bass composers also use tempo which is the speed of the beats or the rhythm so fast beats are usually associated with action excitement dancing and happiness whereas slow beats are usually associated with sad or calming or soothing emotions another thing composers use to create mousse is dynamics which means the has soft or how loud the music is loud sounds can excite us they can surprise us and they can scare us whereas soft sounds can be soothing or they can be a bit spooky sometimes now did you know that music is actually all around us most of the time we 're so busy that we don 't even notice all the wonderful rhythms and melodies that surround us every day think the best sounds and the music comes from nature comes from outdoors so I want you to take the time and listen really carefully to what you can hear it outside it 's also really good to do this when you 're feeling a little bit anxious or worried because it helps calm your thoughts down so take the time to listen take a few deep breaths sit nice and quietly close your eyes and just listen what sounds can you hear there 's music all around us it 's the whooshing of the wind through the trees it 's the crash of the waves on the ocean it 's the pitter-patter sound of the raindrops on the roof on the pavement and on the car it 's the beautiful sound of all the different bird calls that we can hear outside composers have often been inspired by those different melodies and sounds that birds make I wonder how many different types of birds you can hear when you listen really really carefully as well as being all around us music is inside us all and you don 't instrument because the best instrument that we have is actually our own bodies our bodies can make amazing sounds and the first thing to notice is your own heartbeat so if you put your hand your fingers on your wrist or very gently on the side of your throat you can feel your own heartbeat can you hear that can you feel it it 's going pedal but that is the rhythm of your life just like a ticking clock or a beating drum the next thing we have is our voice and our voice can do amazing things we can make our voice do lots of different pictures so we can make a very low sound or we can make quiet sounds we can make loud sounds we can whisper we can all whistle we can use our hands to clap a rhythm different and we can use our face to stamp out different rhythms and wear different types of shoes to make different sounds on the pavement so as well as using our own bodies to make music we can also use things around us as instruments and go searching in your kitchen you 'll find pots and pans you can look outside and see what sort of instruments you can make with sticks so I 'm going to have a little look in my kitchen and in my garden and see what I can find okay I found lots of really interesting things in my heart I found a tree branch that makes this sound I found a water bottle that when I say it makes a species splashing sound I found some old jelly that my children didn 't want to eat and when I shake it it sounds a bit really humid isn 't it I found a bottle and if I blow into it and I found a container and a wooden spoon I can make lots of different sounds so you might know a wonderful story it 's called we 're going on a bear hunt and it 's one of my favorite stories and what I thought we 'd do today was I 'm going to tell this story and I 'm going to use all the things in front of me you ready we 're going on a bear hunt by Michael Rosen we 're going on a bear hunt we gonna catch a big one what a beautiful day we 're not scared oh-oh grass long wavy grass we can 't go over it we can 't go under it no we 're going to have to go through it swishy swashy swishy swashy don 't don 't don 't we going on a bear hunt we 're gonna catch a big one what a beautiful day we 're not scared Oh a river a deep cold river we can 't go over it we can 't go under it Oh No we 've got to go through it splash splash splash splash don 't don 't don 't be going on a bear hunt we go to catch a big one what a beautiful day we 're not scared uh-oh mud thick Luzi mud we can 't go over it we can 't go under it Oh No we 've got to go through it squelch squerch let 's go out squirt pom pom we 're going on a what a beautiful day we 're not scared oh oh a snowstorm a whirling swirling snowstorm we can 't go over it can 't go under it Oh No we 've got to go through it don 't don 't don 't we going on there aren 't we going to catch a big one what a beautiful day we 're not scared oh oh a cave a dark narrow cave we can 't_''_1083.54 go over it we can 't go under it Oh No we 've got to go the right toe to toe to toe what 's that one shiny wet nose to big furry ears two big googly eyes oh it 's a bear quick back through the cave back through the snowstorm back through the mud spots weight well weight back through the river slice fish fish fish fish fish back through the grass swish swish swish swish swish get to our front door shut that all guard stairs oh no we forgot to shut the front door quick back downstairs shut the door back upstairs into bed under the covers we 're not going on so much fun making music out of a story and do you know it 's so much fun to do that at home you can get your siblings and your mum and dad and you can actually do a whole musical performance it can be like an ensemble and everyone can have their own part so all you have to do is choose your favorite picture book and then experiment with lots of different sounds from in your kitchen or on your body from outside and you can make the sounds to represent characters or settings or the start and finish of the book it 's wonderful and when we make music together we bring everyone together so I hope you 've enjoyed exploring how music can create mood and emotion and how we can use music to tell stories so during these school holidays I hope you have fun creating music at home and make sure you take the time out to stop and listen to all the beautiful sounds that surround us every day _"

    "text": "[Music] hi I 'm Jody Davidson welcome to the courtyard today we are going to be utilizing a woven ball that I made in one of my earlier videos and I 'm going to show you how you can use something that probably would end up in the bin to turn this ball into an animal what I 'll need you to do is get yourself a hammer if you don 't have a hammer what other things could you use you could use a brick you could use a piece of wood anything that can hit a nail to make a hole a roofing nail now I like the roofing nails because they have a nice thick round head on them you could use any nail and a piece of wood so that you are not nailing into the table the other thing that you will need is a plastic bottle and I 've also got with me some tweets you 'll see I 've done some pruning this morning and I 've taken all the leaves off my tweaks we 're going to use that as our joining I 'll get you on to the next step so you should have your plastic bottle and what we want to do with it one thing I didn 't mention was you will need a pair of scissors so we 're going to cut your plastic bottle so the first thing we need to do is to pierce a hole in the side now you can use your nail to do that you could use a knife sometimes I do use a knife and just poke that through just to get the start of the hole or if your scissors are sharp enough you can open the blade and put that in once you have that you 're going to cut around your bottle all the way around until you 've got this does that look like anything yet maybe maybe not and then cap down to the bottom part of your bottle and also cut that off now I like to keep all the little off cuts of plastic if they can be used for lots of other activities so now I 've got my two sections now what is where your roofing nail comes in and your hammer piece of wood so using the bottom of your plastic bottle we 're going to put a lot of holes in so you can see why I use the piece of wood underneath and I 'm just going around and around in circles and I 'll put some in there in the middle as well now you want to make sure those holes are big enough so what 's your screw back in can 't_''_230.37 keep it a really good twist just to open up the holes the reason we are doing that is because these holes are going to be used for our sticks to poke through so depending on the thickness of your stick will depend how big your hole is the other things that you will need on your bottom because your bottle is going to piece together like so to create the head of your animal now if you 're wanting ears you need to be able to make a slit sit years to go in so what I will do again is I might make I 'm going to decide which way they 're going to go and I 'll do a little start point and a little end point and then I can cut between those again on the other side again I will poke my nail through you 've got to be a little bit gentle you don 't want to slice the plastic down and then once I 've got those there we go you also might like some eyes so you will have to put your please together and work out where you 'd like the eyes do you want them to sit right up front or on the side you decide and put a hole in for your eyes I 'm going to put mine quite wide apart on the side off the head and again I 'm poking that true and turning that around [Music] there you go the next part is to put this together Matt some bottles will just slide in this bottle is the same size so part of it we will need to put a little cut in just so it can fold inside and so it can fit inside of that bottle you 'll also need to know you 're also going to need to spin it around so that you can get your ears and your eyes in exactly the right place it should hold nice and firm like that this is going to fall the head of your animal so go ahead and do that come back and I 'll show you stage three now I 'm using a bigger bottle just because it 'll be easier for you to see so I 've changed from my small one to my big one the other reason is my ball is actually quite large so when I put this together it is more in scale so what we 're going to do I put some holes in the bottom of the bottle and I 'm going to push it together making sure that my eyes in the right location to my ears now you can have it straight you can tilt it down a little bit it 's completely up to you how you would like your face to look I 'm going quite firm in there but what we need to do is to be able to attach this to the body if you 're wanting to do eyes we can do them afterwards but sometimes it 's just as easy to do it before depending on what sort of you would like to use you might like to use a nut or a seed or you could also use bottle tops using your roofing nail to put a hole in your bottle types what I might do is I might use some nuts later because that 's going to go nicely with my woven form and I 'll put them on at the end the process will be the same and you can do it either way so we 'll put this a little head-on if you can find our eyes again okay so what we 're needing to do is attach this to here and we want it so that it 's not going to come off so we need the two parts to push together we 're going to use our tweaks so I 've got a selection of so we 're going to pipe them through and you can take them right to the knives if you like and then we 're going to poke them through our poor you take that off and we 'll put the N bit through the end so that it 's going across the ball always good fun to see if you can get it in the right spot so it 's been true all I can find that last piece they do like to bend up and around so you 'll have to get your little fingers in there and then we 've got a piece coming out this is going to form the tail on this end if you don 't need to you could have it just sticking on the inside it 's completely up to you you could wind it back through weaving it back through so I 'm going to put about I 've got five holes in there if your holes look quite big you could put multiple sticks through and just poke them continue to poke them through making them as long as you like go and it thought it 's important just to keep an eye on the size of your sticks sometimes when we 're hiking them through you can see I 'm poking through the soft bendy part that can go up and down a little bit it might be easy for you to poke through from the back with the harder part of the stick the thicker part through to the front don 't so depending on how many holes you have in yours continue putting those through until you have the same number to match the holes it 's a bit of a sorting process as we go and that goes through the top so now the job this will form your tail but we 'll add some more to that and you 're going to poke these through the head if your bottle is quite loose what do you think you could do take a little bit of masking tape around I 'm going to try not to use the masking tape and instead just use the pressure of the two pieces pushing together because it 's going to pushing that through this is the thickest part of the branch so it 's taking a little bit off the edge of the branch I should take that off because that 's going to enable me to push that down and through some of our branches coming off this I can pull that off and push it down and then my next piece continue this all the way around remembering that your ears the bits that you 've marked out for your ears need to be at the top there 's nothing worse than finding that you put all your sticks through and your ears are actually sitting at the bottom so go through and do that until you 've got all your sticks through I can see already one of my sticks is going to be quite thick so I may need to make that hole just a little bigger with my briefing nail and I 'm going to turn it around and try and just give a little bit more space for this one to push through okay and then I 'm going to put still got my touch my face on you can see that pushing through then you need to stop pulling your sticks back so that your head is coming back two wards the body make sure your sticks aren 't just poking out the ends you really do want them to poke at the end because then we can attach a tie on there just to keep them in place and then with your tail now I might want my head to go down a little bit so what I 'll do is I 'll take my sticks okay and weave them so they go up and down with our tail we can then grab elastics together but we can also put some more sticks through now if you don 't have our woven egg-shape like this then have a look at one of the earlier videos where I have made show you how to make the egg shape okay push that through there what I can do with these is actually weave them around wrap them around and now I 'm starting to get a nice thick part of the tail so I come back and let 's have a look how they 're looking you might have something that resembles this yours might be a little bit different that 's perfectly okay what I 've got is I 've fixed my head on and I have my twigs sticking out the back so if you are making a tail on your one what we 're going to do is actually we 're going to wrap these sticks around each other so what I 'm doing is under and over and if I turn this to face the camera I 'm just wrapping them and and over each other going in like a spiral down towards the end of the tail so I 'll wrap one around and then I might wrap them around on themselves just to hold them in place and then I do that with another one and you can see that tail starts to come together so it 's that under and over technique it begins to hold things together this is the same technique that we 've used to make our all just move it a bit closer you can see I 'm just going under and over and again wrapping around to the bottom you could also start to wrap the string around to hold it together if that is easier for you and you can bend them a little bit too but make sure you just give those branches a little bit of a wiggle just to loosen up the fibers so again I 'll just quote that one through and you keep going until it 's tight enough that you might your tail might not want to be this long so you can cut it off at the end you can poke it back in on itself so it 's a bit like using the branches ever string and then you can poke these through then I 'll do the same Eclipse I 'll bring it back in here and and and over have a go at that with yours and then we still need to do something with our face because we don 't want to be able to see a plastic bottle the plastic bottle just gives us that really great shape for have a look around whether you have some old fabric that you can use sometimes I use an old t-shirt and I tear it into strips and I 've also used in one of my earlier videos I showed you how to make some string from an old cushion that was ready for the bin anything like that you could also use bark if you wanted to we might even have a go with some bark anything that you 've got just tear it into strips so it 's in Nice long strips and then I 'll show you how we are going to cover up our face the nicest thing about doing this is that there is no glue we haven 't had to use glue for anything we are just using things that have found either in nature or around your house and giving them a new purpose so you can see that tail is starting to come it is very long though so I think we will be cutting that a little bit shorter I 'm going to continue weaving that and then when you have finished back and we 'll do our last little bit so I 've finished off my tail and it 's getting a little bit windy out here so I 'm going to try and just complete this before things start blowing around the last bit we need to do is our hair covering your head you have a few options one is for the ears you can get a stick and just bend it and poke it through the holes to making it whether they be long ears or short ears you could also get a nut I 've actually got a honking up there org am not and I 've drilled a hole in it but you can do anything with it I 've put a piece of wire on and threading it through which we might just do that moment the exact the same process for the eyes one on here I can find fun bit is always trying to get the wire through at the very end we 'll leave him like that for a minute then you need to get I 'm using some Hessian that you anything cut into nice strips like this and you 're just going to wrap it around so what I 've done there goes an eye and it is I have tied it on to the the branch here and then I 'm just going to wrap it around the head now you have to wrap on a diagonal because it is a brown surface and you continue to wrap until your entire head is covered now I could just join my other piece on with a small knot and I can continue wrapping and continue that until your head is completely covered it 's starting to come together you can see the stars come together our eyes for our ears depending on what you 're putting on if you get yourself a pencil or anything round should we use a scissors you can just wrap that around and that can become a little eyeball you could also use a button and putting the black button on or you might just want to draw a little eyeball on that he then he 's actually quite heavy and quite firm depending on than suitable to sit outside or you could use him inside I 'm thinking this one he might sit on my front window sill so that he can see everything that 's going on in my garden [Music] you you [Music] _"

    "text": "you [Music] welcome back to this fourth installation our arts and isolation triple threat you 're acting component my name is Nicola Renton and thank you for joining me today we 're going to be immersing ourselves in Shakespeare now if you 're a true lover of Shakespeare welcome have fun with us but if you 're new to Shakespeare be brave I promise you by the end of this fifteen minutes you are going to love the way I do think the thing you 're going to enjoy the most about Shakespeare from an actor 's perspective is the physicality of it when I worked with central theatre we got to do all the sword fights in Romeo and Juliet turn into stick fight it 's incredibly physical when I turn much ado about nothing with them I played five different characters I got to be this judge who a white wig in little glasses and you know kind of these kind of hands this year 2020 will mark the four hundred and fourth anniversary of William Shakespeare 's death he is largely regarded as one of our greatest directing Shakespeare and in November every year my company the actors workshop auditions for our Shakespeare true that will perform throughout January throughout Perth there are a range of amateur actors all the way to semi-professional that come together and really immerse ourselves in the beautiful Shakespeare text and perform it outdoors through summer we have audiences ranging from 50 to 150 and they bring their wine and their blankets and their cheese platter and they watch this wonderful romp in the park please follow me on Facebook the actors workshop and you keep a lookout for those auditions that are coming up it is a great way to meet like-minded people and really have fun performing Shakespeare I promise you I 'm a wonderful director and I will help you all the way through which is what I 'm going to do now I like the speech when I was about 10 or 11 years old at school I had a wonderful teacher called mrs. Gerber in South Africa and not quite sure why this is an appropriate beautiful for young women but it has stayed with me my petty pace from day to day to the last syllable of recorded time and all our yesterday 's have lighted fools the way to dusty death out brief candle life is but a walking shadow it is a poor player that struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more it is a tale told by an idiot full of sound and fury signifying nothing this is the monologue that you choose let 's put it in context it has been a long road travel from a bet very emotional he conspired with his wife to kill the king and then he himself did the act they covered it all up there are supernatural forces involved and manipulating what 's happening he then has to kill his best friend to keep going along this road of ambition he slaughters or sends the order to slaughter entire family this raging ambition and need to quiet all the critics is become all-consuming his wife feels that she 's losing him and she 's tried to pull him back she 's used everything to say please come back cannot he is his force now war is raging he can look over his battlements and there there comes the forces from England from Ireland from France all coming towards him to take to take down his reign and then he hears that his wife is dead it 's a lot it 's a lot on his plate let 's have a look at those words repeat after me tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow creeps at this petty pace from day to day beautiful say those words now face to the last syllable of recorded time and all our yesterday 's have lighted fools the way to dusty death you out out brief candle [Music] life is but a walking shadow a poor player now player was another word that they used for actors it 's just an actor we 're walking around like actors a poor player that struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more it is a tale told by an idiot full of sound and fury mmm full of sound and fury it means nothing signifying nothing in my speech and tomorrow and tomorrow creeps at this petty pace from day to day to the last syllable of recorded time and all our yesterday 's have lighted fools the way to dusty death out out brief candle life is but a walking shadow a poor player that struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more it is a tale told by an idiot full of sound and fury signifying nothing beautiful other than getting this small bit of training that I 'm going to give you today there are great ways that you can get some experience with Shakespeare and that is watching great X 's perform Shakespeare essential theater comes to Western Australia every year to pass and they perform at a winery wonderful follow them on Facebook another way to watch it is live streaming The Globe Theatre and the Royal Shakespeare Theatre due to isolation or making some of their performances available for free which is incredible and there are lots of wonderful movies for you to watch much ado about nothing with Emma Thompson and Kenneth Branagh Midsummer Night 's in it great way to learn there 's a wonderful resource on the internet called no fear Shakespeare I buy their books a lot but they also have it online for you to see it 's incredible because it has the Shakespeare text on one side and it has a beautiful translation on the other side of every page all the way through so very often people listen to the words that Shakespeare has written in his plays and are very confused by it because it sounds like a totally different language let me give you some hints about this so Shakespeare wrote in a rhythm cause I am bit pentameter and it sounds a little bit like this rhythm Oh Grimlock night Oh night with you so back all right so this rhythm he writes throughout all of his plays which is amazing and what he 's doing is he 's actually putting the emphasis Beach on the important word grim night night hue black hue meaning the color of blackness oh the night is black or the other words on the lesser beat I 'm not as important that sunlight sounds like a heartbeat of course and of course a horse galloping as well beautiful just like with rap or with some poetry this rhythm keeps the pace going beautifully there are a couple of places where he chooses to mess up the iambic pentameter sometimes when a character is going insane but generally all of his takes is a grim look night o night with hue so black o night which ever art when day is not so to fit into his iambic pentameter he tends to start moving things around what he can do is he can drop letters out of words squish words together make up words move words around in the sentence just to fit into this beautiful I am bit pentameter here is Hermia 's monologue from A Midsummer Night 's Dream my favorite play in the scene Hermia confronts Helena her best friend because she feels that Helena has stolen her love in fact what 's happened is naughty character called puck has put a love potion in her boyfriends eyes and when he woke up in the first thing that he so her Meera arrives on the scene and her boyfriend is kissing Helen his hand they started having an argument about this trying to figure out what 's going on and then her best friend calls her a puppet now in the scene is a great thing because they 're calling each other quite nasty words canker-blossom and deeper love and all of a sudden her friend calls her a puppet so she 's very angry anyway she 's trying to get to the bottom and her friend says you you puppet you puppet why so high that way goes the game now I believe that she had made compare between our statures and with her personage her tall personage or high pursuit she had prevailed with him and are you bronze so high in his esteem because I am so dwarfish and so low how low am i thou painted maypole speak how low am i I 'm not yet so low that my nails cannot reach into thine eyes mmm red lorry yellow lorry red lorry yellow lorry really get that mouth moving so you can get around are understood I 'm gonna talk very quickly about point of focus where you 're looking definitely in Shakespeare everything that you do on stage is incredibly important because we 're strong so hard to understand what you 're saying so really I want you to embody the text and and show as much as you can the feeling that you 're doing your point of focus is where you look and it 's really important because we need to know are you talking to yourself are you talking to somebody are you having an internal monologue and struggle with something that you 're doing if you are doing this a lot and moving around a lot it 's very confusing for us or if you 're aimlessly walking up and down it makes no sense walk talk a little bit walk somewhere else with purpose talk a little bit we want all your action to have meaning this has been a lot of fun adventures with Shakespeare as I said please don 't be an actor who won 't do certain things actors have to be able to do stuff there are things that I won 't do as an i OD gambling adverts and I don 't just smoking adverts I teach a lot of young people and I don 't think any of those are healthy for me to put my face on and endorse there are certain saucy scenes that I need to read first and see where I 'm comfortable with so always you will respect yourself and make sure you are in a safe environment but you are not to shy away from things where you just don 't feel like you have the right stuff because I promise you being in a Shakespeare production is honestly some of the best fun work that I 've ever done on an amateur level and in a class and on a professional stage as well so please watch some movies and when that opportunity comes up maybe your community is putting together something really fun that you are going to go in there and audition remember we know as directors and casting agents we know how difficult Shakespeare is your director is always going to help director didn 't explain something to me I 'm out I don 't get everything right and they go you know that word that you 've been saying that 's not how you pronounce it or you need to put an emphasis in a different place set for that sentence that make sense that 's what we 're here for directors and teachers so know that you are in kind hands and you don 't need to know everything about Shakespeare you just need to be adventurous and I promise you you will have a lot of fun parting is such sweet sorrow that I should say good night till it be morrow thank you for joining me in this fourth video for arts and isolation for the city of Joondalup and have a wonderful time this week immersing yourself in all things Shakespeare my grandma and your grandma sitting by the fire my grandma said to your grandma I 'm gonna set the world on fire talk about hey now hey now I go I go on they break it down I come on feet ha I 'm Nanda banana hey hey come on banana hey _"

    "text": "[Music] hi everyone its luck and welcome back to yet another very special edition of City tuna luck odds and isolation dance edition this video is going to be a little less open active and more sit and talk we 're gonna be sitting here for a little while what I 've done for this video is I reach down to as many working professional dancers that I have access to and I 've asked them to give me some of their advice about what it comes to auditions auditions don 't just happen for dances an audition is just like a job interview and everyone in their life is going to eventually go to a job the thing about going to a job interview is you 're demonstrating a set of skills that you practice for studying for and experience to gas be able to help your employer when it comes to working in a professional situation or even in an amateur preparing for an audition who 's a lot like preparing for an interview you want to make sure that you look your best you want to make fortunate that I 've been able to work as professional in the performing arts industry for the past nine years now every working professional remembers eath anything that first audition there that went and wished that they had the knowledge that they have now when it comes to go into an audition so this video is for you the person who has never gone to an audition before whether it maintain you auditioning for something you school maybe it 's audition for something in your wider community maybe you are auditioning for tertiary education warming arts maybe you 're going for it basically this is for you to give you the bit of advice to help you for your best self you 'll be prepared when it comes to additions now this of course is going to be skewed mainly towards dancers but the tips and tricks that I have got possible but every singer oh you 're a mixture of the three the true Triple Threat as they say to work in musical theater whatever your case is I hope that you find some relevant and interesting informations that do before you even go to the audition is get on that trusty little jingle good you want to get on the internet anymore first thing you when you look up is what is the show you 're auditioning is it something that 's already existed before most shows have already been conceived and so you have access to such things as the plots the characters and also there 's certain style or genre that may be used in this particular show unless it said original show you 're not going to have as much information but what you can do is you can look up the company that is holding the audition so this company might be known for a very particular style or genre that you can best prepare your and thirdly try and find out who is the creative team that are working with this particular knowing the gritty creative team and what they may have worked on before will give you a little bit more of an insight into what they are now once you 've done all that you want to make sure that you silly in a little bit like a chronometer but how many times in your life have you gone to check something was in your bag that we were meant to take with you on a Saturday hi my name is Lachlan I am so one thing that I like to do is create a chance now my checklist involves a couple of different years and I 'm gonna read it to you now first thing that you want to have in your bag is a copy of your headshot and you also want to have in the resume whether your resume is this long this long it 's always good to have a spare one with you because sometimes there can be over 100 200 people in your audition the best way to be remembered is to be organized and prepared now on your resume you want to make sure that you have the contact information a little bit about your training or your education and also your experience now this is something that is quite like a normal resume except the best thing to do it 's the list beforehand and go on reverse chronological order most recent to the oldest one you 've done most companies and most auditions only want to see the most risk the four or five most recent projects in my bag you want to have the essentials as well you wanna have your water bottle you definitely wanna have snacks sometimes auditions can go over twelve you also sometimes want to have something to keep yourself occupied when between rounds I always like to have a book always breathe if you 're following a charger you never know when you 're going to new and sometimes you also good to bring with you spare clothes street clothes and also specs my dance way yet quite sweaty if you want to be able to change brush with that you also want to make sure you have a town with you because same thing following that it 's also really good to bring your speed dance shoes I like to always carry with me a few just in case you freshen up or look to be your best self throughout the day also simple my your the right side but never spray your deodorant if you are using a spray on deodorant in a room full of other people you don 't know how many people in that room could be in a snake so it is really helpful to bring either a roll-on deodorant or a sense break because I can set people off that 's unfair they 're they 're just as much as you hoping to get the job something that 's also really important is making sure you wear the clothing which best showcase me you know I 'm not saying that you should walk into my audition wearing a three-piece suit or a tuxedo or a whole new ballgame however that 's why we 're going to spare clothes I like to wear something bright and by coaching if in terms of dancing you also want to show your alignment you are showing technique up and you also want to show that you are working to maintain a healthy now when I say healthy physique that doesn 't mean you expect but it does mean that you are maintaining healthiness rehearsal process and the performance AC it 's really important for professionals to maintain insurance and that 's again a little bit of advice when it comes to going to an audition for Julie 's yeah I know it sounds a little bit far-fetched you 're amazing every casting agent ever spoken to has told me one thing they want to hire you they 're not looking for people to come into the audition and in any case they 're looking for what they perceive to be the right person for the right group of people to be in their shop and you don 't get to determine whether you are the right person or not that 's why when it comes to this industry the best thing you can do is remove any sort of judgement and what you did in the room determines you that 's very difficult just like arts is for everyone not ivory sure is forever as you begin to explore working in this industry or even going into it as more hobby you 'll understand that directors producers choreographers music directors they 're all moment a bit unfortunately when it comes toward issues more often than not you 're not gonna get any feedback in addition and that 's uncanny feedback is for learning feedback is something that we get from our classes for in our group situations when we work with others an audition is a much more individual experience so one thing that I was recommend after original audition is grab a pen piece of paper or just get out the note snap in your phone and write down your experience of that audition now something that a lot of people do I have a lot of advice about getting through my personal advice is I introduced myself he 's what I usually say hi I 'm lovely shake hands with anyone that I can do I thanked them for the opportunity to audition with them in that day I tell them how old I am I 'm not telling you and then my most important thing is to look around the specs how much room do you have if it 's a dance audition you might not have a lot of a solo audition you could have a use of a whole room now you could be auditioning for just one person or a group of you and that 's great the best thing you can do is to give your focus to as many people as possible now there are different schools of thought in this now you could be auditioning and be projecting that energy into the whole space here 's the advice that I wish I would say you 're not in an audition just to show that you have skill to be able to walk that 's not making requests but you 're also doing is you 're showcasing you ask first do you have the skills to be able to work with other people to think creatively to work within constraints of time and deliver product vision there 's no such thing as a perfect audition there 's no such thing as an imperfect it is exactly what it is it 's an audition and you 're showing that you have the abilities that you have and remember so the next part of this video I instrument what happens if you get the job yes you 've gone to the audition you 've gone with you 've gone through all the stages you 've met the people you got the phone call congratulations they want you to be in their shot or their program amazing congratulations now here 's the thing the hard work hasn 't even begun yet so this next part of the video is what happens when you actually get a job the three pieces of advice that I have any person [Music] or if they 're walking into a room to be in their first music you remember ek ID number number two watch number three do the work I know it sounds far-fetched but often when it comes to living our dreams of getting it wrong a show like this we can forget it simpler skills such as them do the work when you walk into a room there 's something that you need to you are meant to be and you don 't need to prove that anymore what you do need to do is you need to consider their lucky you 're so fortunate to have this so if you can take small piece of advice and I have learned from working in this industry is to listen watch and do the work you know you 're gonna have a great experience you want to listen to your directors you want to listen to your other classmates you would have watched sugar enemies your choreographers you want to watch and have other people women as well so you can maybe pick up some tips and tips and tricks to apply in your own words really the most important is to do to work probably recent or just remind yourself oh just remember me and if you ever forget that you are well I want to thank you so much for sticking around and listening to me talk to you on this camera you want to get up and do something a little bit more active maybe check out one of the other videos that I put up on the channel or you can check out one of the videos by Stephanie or Nicola which cover a wide range of much for checking out this video and as always just keep dancing wait now before you go anywhere Stephanie Nicola and myself are taking online submissions for our upcoming masterclass you might be wondering what a masterclass is so in our master class we 're going to be taking individuals from the community and work with them to develop their skills in the arts while still remaining in isolation so if you would like a little bit of extra help from me when it comes to your dancing or in developing your performance or working on your personal style or anything dance related whether you have never danced before or you 've been dancing your entire life doesn 't matter we want to help you I especially want to ask any of our future trippled threader 's out there that 's a singer a dancer and an actor all in one to let us know how we can help you send a submission video of yourself doing a little bit of movement and also asking for a little bit of help for something specific to the arts and isolation project a couple of people in their coming weeks whenever you need send this video link and we 'll help you out remember everyone just keep dancing you _"

    "text": "hello and welcome to your fourth singing lesson as part of the triple threat project well we had some fun last week getting our vocal folds to vibrate I 'm going to be staying in the sound source again today and going into the topic of range now before I do that I want to begin with a very important message and that is that there is no one in the world that has a voice like yours no one your voice is unique and it needs to be loved and cherished and celebrated so often I come across singers who are desperately trying to sound like somebody else instead of embracing what they sound like and what their set of experiences brings to their performance so I want you to love your voice now it might not be in the condition that you want it to be that 's okay I certainly know that my body is not in the condition I wanted it to be after being isolated for so many weeks but the point is that I can change I can train and try and get my be in you can do the same with your voice you can get vocal lessons you can join a choir you can set aside a time for yourself to do some regular practice so that you might be able to find what your voice is capable of doing on a regular basis so with that said let 's move into the area of range what is range basically range is the lowest note that you can sing and the highest note that you can sing and all those notes in between now if you 're not sure how to find your range really easy way would be to get in front of a piano or a piano app and just start to speak and play around with those keys and start to find somewhere around there where you sort of hear it sounds a little bit like you 're speaking tone and then try and sing through that with that more elongated breath and from that I would use that as my marking point now you don 't even need to know note names you can just maybe designate a try and go up from there and find out how many numbers you can hit so for example to try and find my low note from there I would just continually go down until my voice just Peters out and it 's no longer making that song sound so I think that 's about it debatable whether that 's the same sound as well it 's definitely sung whether it 's Pleasant that 's debatable so from there I would go cool I know that this note here was really probably the lowest one I was comfortable saying was in my range and then I would go all the way up the other end and try and find what my highest note was and then I would mark the date and go cool on this date this is my range now that 's very different to what I call your singing performance range and that range should never be those notes that are hit and miss so if you 're finding that you can hit a bottom note on some days and not on others I personally would never include I don 't want to be there second-guessing myself if that note is going to work today so you might find that your performance range is just slightly in from your entire range and you can think of it a bit like a stereo you never want the volume right down on the zero because you can 't hear anything and on the flipside I don 't want it on the 100 and blowing my eardrums so you want to make sure that your singable range is just within those realms that you know that it will always work for you and that it 's not going to give out because it 's one of those notes that 's maybe maybe note sorry I 'm just going to quickly go through the most common voice types and I 'm gonna start with the gentleman so gentlemen if you are a base or a baritone and you just did that range exercise you might find that you were able to sing a note somewhere that was around about let 's have a look you would have had one that was probably was more comfortably around this area and then your top register would have been maybe somewhere around here or even a little bit higher than that maybe here so fair distance and those voices belong in what we 'd call our base slash baritone area tenors you are generally higher than the baritones and again all of this there there are exceptions and there are extensions but I 'm just going to give you a rough guide so for the tenors you might find that your bottom note that you were comfortable singing was maybe around about here and then your note that you 're comfortable maybe here for now and for some of you you might have even been able to go yeah and that 's my tenor range moving into my Altos and Metsu so Altos you would have really kind of been around about this area that met size maybe is slightly higher and then for your Altos you might have peaked out and depends on how much breath pressure you had as well but maybe somewhere around there and for the and for the met so area would have been your lower one and then anywhere up to here possibly higher and those are generally our sort of choir ranges if you like so if you 're singing in a choir you would have seen that you 've got the the basses the tenor the alto or they might have called it the met so line and the Sopranos now why does range matter well it matters because if you want to think of it like a runner if you are running in the wrong distance you 're just gonna feel uncomfortable you probably can still do it but you 're probably going to feel uncomfortable for most of the race and then if I let you run in a distance that really suits you that your body is designed to do you 're just going to love it and feel super comfortable sorry some runners are designed to run a hundred really well or a kilometer really well or marathon or an ultra marathon yes they can run those other distances but one of them is going to feel really easy and organic for them to make sure that when you 're singing it feels like it matches you and your capabilities at that current time today 's exercises what I 'm going to do is focus on the two common ones that I come across so I 'm going to give you some range exercises for those of you that are singing in choirs and finding yourself to have to sing higher and possibly higher for sustained periods of time or even lower for sustained periods of time and then I 'm going to turn my attention to those of you that are singing maybe the contemporary and musical theater repertoire where you 're trying to take some more weight into that middle upper register and maybe you 're finding that you 're really struggling to get up there so I 've got an exercise for you as well let 's get crackin lip trills lip trills are such a fantastic exercise regardless of what genre you 're singing now lip trill sounds something like this like a really happy horse if you find that difficult to do you can absolutely use your fingers you 've just been botoxed I guess so if that helps you use it now in this exercise we 're going to go 1 3 5 8 10 and then come back down so they arpeggio we 're going to add that 10th note on so it 's going to sound something like this now the wonderful thing about using a lip trill is that it 's going to open up your neck muscles and it 's also going to show you if you are stopping your power supply your breath because it just won 't work if you cut that off so you want to try this one with me I 'm going to take you pretty high on this exercise especially to help those of you that are having to sing in those upper ranges such as tenor and soprano in particular here we go and [Music] love your work keep going [Music] [Applause] go one more this way come back down [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] excellent keep that power going last to [Music] did you make it the whole way through if so fantastic work if not practice now this one comes with a warning it 's not particularly pleasant to listen to it 's gonna be a case of Matt technique brings all the dogs to the yard so dose I didn 't warn you now in this one we 're going to play around with vocal weight or the mix so for some of you you might be finding that you 're hitting a wall for your high notes and that they 're just not working and sometimes that 's due to the fact that you 're still in this really heavy position from the bottom and haven 't allowed enough of the change in the vocal fold to happen so they can get into a slightly thinner position so it can hit that pitch so we 're thinking of this is like baking a cake we 're trying to find that right ratio that means that I have still got that power but I 'm also able to hit that note that I 'm trying to achieve so it 's a bit of a yodeling exercise we 're going to transition between singing a feeling and letting it completely yodel and flick over into one that 's a much lighter sounding color and if you are struggling to get that yodel to happen well that 's a sign that you need to work on it to try and get that vocal agility happening for yourself at the end of the exercise I 'm going to see if we can incorporate into one of the most beautiful songs of all time somebody to love so it 's going to sound something like this we are going to go up into thirds now we are going to start our beginning note with a lot of heaviness and then we 're basically just going to let it pop over when we go for that third and go into a much softer sound so it 's going to sound something like this [Music] oh so I 'm gonna play with the white I 'm gonna do that again [Music] or sounds a bit like a foghorn next one I 'm gonna keep going up heavy switch heavy heavy first switch baby you same deal Oh [Music] JMO [Music] few more to go [Music] heavy Cena heavy [Music] by the right notes last one coming up [Music] what did you discover did you find that you weren 't really able to go into that softer mix or did you find that it was quite easy and you discovered then that you could add a little bit more of that feeling to those heavier notes we 're looking at trying to find that mix now that right mix where I can add a little bit of that softer feeling into that full of feeling and apply it to somebody to love so as an example you could try singing now [Laughter] so you 're going for that really delicate mix once again now we 're going to add a tiny bit of that feeling as we come into that full of mix as we descend now through the other passage sorry [Laughter] let 's see if we can do that one again la Oh Oh I feel like we just channeled Freddie Mercury _"

    "text": "[Music] hi everybody welcome back to bolognese TV my name is Papa Bologna and I 'm so excited that you could join me today we 're going to be seeing one of my friends who 's been spending a little bit more time in his laboratory over the last couple of weeks and to see what he 's been up to before we can get started we want to make sure our brains and our body are ready to do the things that we need to do today so I 'm going to show you a little bit of a warm-up if you 've been sitting too long or if you 've got the fidgets and perhaps you can do it with me and there 's a couple of really tricky coordination exercises in there are you ready okay let 's start off nice and slow we 're gonna rotate our wrists circle that 's it going outwards back the other way very good flicking our hands out forward and out to the side and back forward we 're gonna fight tech palms facing forward like this I 'm gonna again from in index finger middle finger ring finger and little finger and out very good okay give him a shake already we 're going to put our chin to our chest and back up and get to the side and back the other way and looking over our left shoulder and looking over our right shoulder and gently just looking up to the ceiling and back down good way or a nice little row excellent we gotta take one arm across that body just like this and one on my request other but just like this and when I 'm behind a head looking down looking forward that arm out and take the other arm through that 's it good work okay how are you feeling a little bit warmer now that I hands are nice and warm up I don 't know my brains a little bit so here we go this one is called nose and ears some other friends of mine on the circus taught it to me okay so you can place your hands on the desk or on your knees and all you 're nose just like this not too hard and then crossing your arm over grab your ear just like this easy right place your hands back on the table and then put your opposite hand on your nose its opposite end of what y 'all_''_185.05 yeah that 's it so it looks a little bit like this so place hands on tap nose ear tap no yeah okay not that we 're gonna track together let 's see if we can do it nice and slow then if you get really good really fast did you get it ah too easy I 'd love to see some attempts at how you went to see how fast you go I 've got lots of coordination exercises that I would love to teach you over the next couple of episodes to see how you go well I 've got to tell you I 've been really missing some of my friends so I thought I 'd call a very special friend of mine and he 's a scientist and performer and he does all sorts of things let 's give him a ring oh it 's great to see you how are you doing I 'm really well how are you and what do you want to I tell you what your timing is fantastic I was just about to do a little demonstration here because we 're all stuck inside of a little bit of science how about it yeah totally oh great okay well here 's what you 're going to need you 'll need a bottle you don 't need a fancy chemistry bottle like me just a bottle some vinegar some bicarbonate of soda and a balloon ah yes you may also need a rubber band depending on how big your bottle is so here 's how we do our experiments so first we take our [Music] take our vinegar and pour it into the bottle then we take our balloon and I 've already taken my bicarb soda and poured it into the balloon so this balloon has a bunch of bicarbonate soda already inside so now I stretch the top of the balloon over the top of the bottle oh I won 't need the rubberband for these two mix I think this balloon is going to blow up all by itself are you ready ready do yo all right mmm three two one oh boy that that is a lot of gas look the balloons blowing up all by itself see what do you think puppy would you be able to do that at your house yeah we should do some more experiments oh of course there are hundreds more science experiments for me to show you oh well I 'll see you next time you want to call by the mag lab and I 'll show you what 's going on oh well I 've been a lookout I think I have a lot of cleaning up to do it mmm I 'm gonna get this lab back in tip-top shape just remember there 's lots and lots of experiments that you can do at home anyway oh go let 's say goodbye I 'll see you next time puppy have a great day bye see you Magnus thank you bye that was great um do you want to give it a go with me what we need we need some balloons just one for our experiment a bottle some bicarbonate of soda and some vinegar now I 've used about a hundred meals here and some teaspoons I think as well okay well let 's start with the easy bit shall we take your bottle and your bicarbonate soda now remember to ask saw some help from your parents or your carer we 're going to be pouring vinegar into the bottle nice and slowly like that use white vinegar cleaning vinegar all sorts of things here alright to pop that window over there and a bottle over here I 'm gonna take a bicarbonate of soda and a balloon all right and we 're gonna try and put 2 teaspoons of bicarb into the balloon now this is where it 's a little bit tricky but I 'm going to show you something that I look plant and I 'm gonna pull the balloon over the neck just like so over the spoon it 's going to help me put some of the bike up into the spoon okay so I 'm gonna just like that and you might need some help this is the trickiest bit probably gonna make a bit of a mess and maybe do it over a bowl a chopping board whatever you can find it step one in let 's bring out just like that in now you could use a funnel or a piece of rolled-up cardboard to try and push the bicarb in there as well I 'm gonna put in a little bit more just a bit more see if we can get a big reaction okay that 's all I 'm gonna get in there bicarb up my nose okay put our lids on put that bicarbonate over there alrighty let me take a balloon over the top of that bottle like so alright and then we tip a balloon up see how it goes blowing it up isn 't it it looks so great that 's a good reaction alright well I think that 's all the time we have today and thanks so much for joining me we 'd love to see your experiments at home and remember the science can be there if you 'd like to see us do any specific kind of experiments please don 't hesitate to get in touch and we 'll see you all next one next time thanks everybody goodbye [Music] _"

feel lots lots better and also seeing their friends I really love that story did you enjoy that story do you know sometimes when I 'm feeling sad it 's good to be with some friends but then I do something else I 've got a special little poem that I do when I 'm feeling sad would you like to do it with me are you ready we 've got to start off sad like me when I 'm sick of being me I like to pretend that I am a chimpanzee I 'm swinging in the jungle and when I 'm sick of being that I like to pretend I 'm a fluffy cats I 'm cleaning myself and when my cat has gone to sleep I like to pretend that I 'm a hungry sheep yum yum yum I 'm eating up all the green grass and when my sheep is really full then I pretend I am an angry bull and when my bull has run a mile then I pretend I 'm eating all the Flies pretend that I 'm a happy seal and when my seal has swam out to sea I have another go I 've been me and I do feel a lot better too how about you do you feel good too it 's really good to find out what our feelings are to name them and to work out what we can do with them well I think it 's just about time to sing another special song because miss Polly is feeling something too she 's feeling very oh so tired miss Polly it 's time to sing a lullaby song have you got your babies with you everybody get your little babies give them a kiss and a little pet and let 's sing a lullaby song with Miss Polly are you ready lavenders blue dilly dilly lavenders green when I am King dilly dilly you shall be queen who told you so dilly dilly who told you so it was my heart dilly dilly that told me so miss Polly 's going to sleep give your babies a kiss and pop them in their cots to have a 've had a really lovely time today seeing with me and talking about our feelings you can keep talking about your feelings with mums and dads too because it 's actually one of our early literacy skills that 's all the things we learn before we start to read and by talking about our feelings and identifying them is naming things well Ted bear has had a good day he did start off a bit sad but he 's decided now he 's going to join the party can you see my party over there there

need to teach the old mean blue teapot a lesson this it so as the blue teapot strutted around his high high shelf the cups and the sauces huddled together and hatched a very clever plan from one side of the shelf to the other and the winner would be crowned king of the cupboard I am already together cupboard being placed with care on this high high shelf but sits on the fastest anyway I accept the cups and saucers chose the speediest yellow cup and the fastest green plate to run on their of the room was asked to judge the race and she had a good view of both the bottom and the top shelves keeping an eye on the yellow Cup and the green plate on the lower shelf and the blue teapot on the highest shelf the candlestick yelled up ready set go Oh three began to sprint as fast they could across the shelf but the tape up quickly ran in ahead look at me so fast so hot you can 't catch me I 'm king teapot but the cups and saucers plan I said near the end of the shelf the yellow cup and the green plate slowed down while the blue teapot revs faster he ran faster and faster and faster until he ran straight off the edge of the cabin down down down he felt dang pong ping the teapot landed on a shelf beneath the cups and sources have wedged himself between a toaster and a biscuit tin and slowly a big crack crinkle along the blue teapot starting from the chip of his handle to the end of his spout the cups and 'm very happy at taking the mean old blue teapot a lesson and the blue teapot never said a mean word to anyone again as he settled into his new home on the lower shelf

    "text": "lost Perth is published by London publisher pavilion books The Lost series covers around 50 towns and cities in the United Kingdom America and Australia I was invited to write the Perth edition in 2017 and what follows is a small selection of subjects from the book it 's tempting to see this presentation and the book it is based on as evidence that Perth has thrown away its history but I would encourage a rather more considered approach and a nod to the positive as in every age attitudes to what constitutes our history and heritage change and these days we are very prone to looking at history through the wrong end of the telescope judging decisions of the past by the criteria of today with a few notable exceptions the places activities and events recorded here were at the time of their disappearance considered inconsequential by the vast majority of Perth 's population we now have different attitudes and the evident interest in our past and our architectural history is to me a great encouragement that the decisions of the future will be better informed from the demise for nothing else it 's for guiding our future this is the home of one of Perth 's first lawyers alfred stone alfred and his wife arrived in the Swan River Colony in November 1829 and in early 1830 he was granted land at the eastern end of st. Georges Terrace stones house the first private residence on the street others soon followed and by 1833 since Georges Terrace was a fashionable residential area in that year a regulation was passed requiring owners on the terrace to build houses with a value of at least 200 pounds thus ensuring only the well-off families could live in the area the plans for this house were drawn up by Alfred and a spacious house typical the period resulted alfrid stone was one of Perth 's earliest photographers and in this photo from about 1860 Fanny stone his daughter is seen in the dining room at alpha cottage with the family 's pet cockatoo kaki in his cage behind her separate buildings a short distance from the back of the house linked by a covered way contained the kitchen store workshops table and of an outbreak of fire from the kitchen in the early days of the Swan River Colony families had to be almost self-sufficient in the production of food for the table alfred was a keen gardener and in 1838 drew a plan of his beloved and productive garden a large vineyard fruit trees and a vegetable patch as shown in this plan potatoes radishes and other root vegetables were the main crops for shade and utility the front garden contained a lilac to mulberry trees and a number of olive trees the stone family continued at Alpha cottage passed Alfred 's death in 1873 and it 's not known exactly when alpha cottage was demolished but by 1896 it had changed hands and it was probably at that time it met its demise Lionel Samson was a merchant from a wealthy London family he and his brother William arrived in Western Australia in August 1829 within hours of disembarking they had set up a shop on what we now call bathers beach this was followed by the establishment of a wine and spirit merchant auctioneers and import business Lance Samson Australia in 1842 Samson built one of the most substantial residences in Perth at that time on the northwest corner of st. Georges Terrace and barracks Street according to the Perth Gazette the new house was more in keeping with the fashionable houses of Sydney than the simple dwellings of Perth at a cost of over 3,000 pounds it must have been the talk of the town and Lionel celebrated the completion of his mansion with an ostentatious supper and ball attended by 150 people [Music] Larnell Sampson moved back to Fremantle in 1875 and the building was leased to the newly formed world club as their clubhouse at an annual rent of 75 pounds the club moved into its own premises in 1892 and the newly formed exchange club moved into Samson 's old home five years later this club moved next door and the house was sold as part of a Supreme Court order to settle a property dispute after that it was demolished and the site was redeveloped because of our weather covered malls have been a popular feature of central Perth since the opening of the was being constructed on a lane between Murray and Wellington streets opposite the railway station central arcade was conceived by Robert McMaster an architect from Melbourne who settled in Perth in the early 1890s construction of central arcade began in the middle of 1903 and under the title go ahead Perth a report in August of that year published in the West Australian record spoke excitedly if the new development quite a new and important development is proceeding in the midst of Perth almost as yet unnoticed by the general public mr. McMaster with a busy staff of workmen is transforming what has seen hitherto known as Station Street into an up-to-date arcade although the arcade was not officially opened until 1906 advertisements published late in 1903 indicate at least one trader had already moved in the commercial trading company a well known local firm of tailors seems to have opened before the building was finished part outside the Wellington frontage of this arcade can be seen a 1918 Dodge Dora and a 1912 Ford T tourer after the official opening in March 1906 the arcade was heralded as a strain ish a report in the following day Sunday Times infused the new central arcade was opened for business last night and proved to be quite a feature in the amusement of the city all the stalls completed to date have been occupied a mr. McMaster expects that all will be taken up by next Saturday the air of absolute cleanliness about the place makes it look inviting the building was a tall barn like structure cladding corrugated iron with glass sky sites along the apex of the roof the Wellington Street frontage had an elegant Federation style facade with an iron canopy and balcony initially instead of individual self-contained retail units the building was divided into stalls stable light from which each trader operated very similarly to Fremantle market this photo shows the butcher 's store on the day of opening the sign hanging amongst the meat says do not ask for credit as the gun is loaded with the stalls eventually being replaced by shop fronts the arcade thrived until the outbreak of the First World War even boasting a live band giving a discourse of music on from the City Council suggesting that the arcade was unhealthy in order to improve the surroundings for the new GPO building the central arcade was demolished in 1922 and a new Street officially named Forrest Place was created in 1923 the decision caused some complaint as the australian of the 18th of August 1922 shows the pulling down of the picturesque old central arcade to make way for the new GPO Street has meant a general far and wide scattering of tenants who have been clustered together for many a long year most of these people run small businesses that do not advertise to any extent so that they will be certain to suffer a considerable loss of clients by the break up an unavoidable departure from the long-established site white city also known as Kui city or ugly land was an amusement park originally established around the time at the first world war in Supreme Court Gardens probably best described as Perth 's first theme park White City was a popular place of entertainment for a wide section of the community and the venue enabled local charities to hold land because the ugly men 's Association managed many of the charity events there the gardens were often used for other purposes and white City had to be dismantled and reassembled at regular intervals the cost of constructing and demolishing the structures frequently and complaints about noise from the neighbors resulted in the amusement park being moved in 1922 to the bottom of Williams Street the opening event there was reported in The Daily News in November 1922 from next Friday carnival Square at the foot of Williams Street will be thrown open for the benefit of those in need of light amusement fresh air unrest amidst Pleasant surroundings and under comfortable conditions white city will be a representation of a big recreation park where concerts Punch and Judy open-air dancing hoopla and the latest American games in addition to other forms of amusement will be presented nightly light refreshments cool drinks ice creams lollies and an endless variety of pleasant elements will be available with a carnival atmosphere their amusements including wheels and swings games of chance boxing log chopping bands and dancing a serious incident at the ground a result of the recent deaths in connection with snake-charming exhibitions the Secretary of the State Gardens Board has notified the tenants of white city that exhibitions of snakes and snake charming will not be permitted on the premises in future the venue was popular with Aboriginal people as well as the European population this was something that chief protector of Aborigines AO Neville did not like sadly the 1927 prohibited area declaration compelled Aboriginal people not on lawful business to leave the city this gave Neville the excuse he needed to make the name White City poignant Lee relevant White City was popular with many other groups and individuals much to the annoyance of many who considered it an extremely immoral concern in an article White City why it must go the West Australian leader writer Raffles complained that the venue contains a large open-air dance floor on which youths with their hats on their heads perform intricate and sometime in modest steps with young women whom probably they have never seen before the newly established Town Planning Commission called for its demolition so that my quote beauty and white City closed in 1929 within months of its closure white city had been redeveloped as gravel tennis courts with a Tea Room alongside today the area is the site of esplanade underground station at the western end of the Esplanade in Delpy close to the now close to wory Center was the Dalkeith hot pool this started its life as a hole filled with hot water from a burst artesian bore the bore had been discovered by a builder boring for water to supply Sunset Hospital on the escarpment above the hot water was piped up to the hospital where perversely it was put through a refrigeration unit and fed into the cold water system in the early 1920s a faulty cut off valve caused a back pressure which cranked the pipe the escaping water formed a large pool which was promptly named the hot pool and rapidly became popular with campers yachters and youngsters from the locality the pool was soon christened a spa but analysis showed apart from some traces of salt there was nothing of any therapeutic value in the water the pool gained a notorious the mirror was a weekly newspaper published from 1921 until 1956 and was the paper everyone loved to hate using scandal and titillation to increase its sales with headlines like high jinks at the hot pool the mail would cover the not infrequent court cases for misdemeanors that probably wouldn 't even be noticed today for example on the 7th of December 1935 the mirror wrote under the title nudity at Dalkeith in the early hours of this morning the police descended on the hot pool at Dalkeith and there discovered two young men bathing in the nude also present were two girl companions who wore only one minut garment each quartet was charged in the perth police court this morning when one of the men was fined five pounds and the other four pounds on one of the male 's also a further penalty of two pounds was imposed for tendering a false name the girls were fined one pound each incidentally in the nude or nearly nude has been going on of warm nights at the hot pool in Dalkeith for so many years many people will probably scores who go there their bathers in 1938 the mirror wrote the hot pool at Dalkeith has become notorious for its attraction to nudists and rarely as this secluded haven without its birthday suitors at night and in the early hours of the morning during the Second World War the pool reached the peak of its summer night activities probably because the military were using the area for pt instruction which would have introduced service Magnum women to the nighttime possibilities of the pool by october 1945 the military authorities had decided enough was enough and were threatening to fill in the hot pool such was the popularity of the pool that one enterprising young patron created housings hangout a probably unlicensed bar after the Second World War the Netherlands rode board took over management of the pool from the state gardens board newspapers in 1946 reported a new hot pool large enough for swimming in place of the old one was to be constructed complete with changing sheds which it has to be said usually gained an air of redundancy after about 10 o 'clock at night in the made to the changing sheds and in November of 1952 60 Jehovah 's Witnesses were baptized in the pool nobody reported whether they were closed or naked even with these improvements there was still complaints of men 's swimming in their underpants the pool finally closed in 1957 when an application to use the water from the bore for swimming purposes had been refused by the state government in the 1950s silver chain produced an extravaganza of flowers which became one of the most popular events of its time the concept was created 20 years earlier when South Australia 's silver chain Volunteers started national flower day in Adelaide this raised funds by covering every possible City space with floral displays and selling flower buttonholes to passers-by the concept proved very successful and the idea of a similar festival being staged in Perth was first mooted in 1949 plans began to be made for a festival to be held on the 15th of September 1950 around 200 representatives of participating organizations met in the shell building on st. George 's Terrace to begin the process of creating the largest Flower construct floral displays at the foot of selected trees on st. George 's Terrace and in many other locations around the city additional decorated stalls were to be positioned on as many city intersections as possible flowers both wild and cultivated were sent to Perth from all over Western Australia their transport being provided free by the government railways and the Midland Railway Company despite blustery winds the day before almost every building in the city centre made an effort to produce a colorful display the West Australian reported all forms of transport were heavily taxed yesterday morning and the streets were soon crowded with sightseers as the day advanced schoolchildren flocked into the city to see the displays the day raised 2500 pounds primarily through the sale of floral badges and buttons and was deemed a great success over the following years the festival grew in size and not only spread to the Perth suburbs but also to other Western Australian towns by the mid 1950s the event was raising in excess of 5,000 pounds a year by the late 1950s the format changed to a flower show which the whole event wilted Viking house or the Viking buildings as it was originally named was a development project for the stirlitz Paul and Richard wood German and they initially emigrated to Victoria but the lure of the gold rush brought first Richard and then Paul to Western Australia they established strelitzia shipping agents of Perth Fremantle and Kalgoorlie in addition to their core business Paul was appointed the Western Australian consul for the Netherlands and his brother the equivalent for Denmark and Sweden why the name for the building was chosen is unclear although it 's likely to derive from the brothers diplomatic links with Scandinavia to represent the theme the stern the head of a Viking warrior was carved above the main entrance and glowered down at all passes by the very fine building was designed by local architect Joseph Allen Allen seemed to be the strelitzia choice having worked on other projects for them around the city the building stood 115 feet tall and was described as a skyscraper by the newspapers at the time of its opening all terms are relative and although modest by today in the early nineteen hundred 's it cost 25 thousand pounds to build and had over 50 offices either in Suites or single occupancy each with its own strong room each floor had its own bathroom facilities the main entrance and fry a had a nautical look with decorative tiles featuring ships the top floor was leased to the amateur sports club and had an ornate oak ceiling with complementary furnishings it also had one of the first automatic lifts in Perth following the first world war the building was renamed national house for patriotic reasons and during the 1920s it was the venue for many grand gatherings this photograph was taken at a women service guilds luncheon held in the amateur sports club on the top floor in of 1929 later the building became the venue for Perth 's first nightclub the Miami Club which opened in August of 1937 it must be said however that the concept of a nightclub in the 1930s was so different to the current examples the West Australian reported the inaugural dinner and dance of the Miami Club Perth 's first a nightclub national house a week later the mirror had the headline the Miami nightclub is a Perth man 's dream realized somewhere to go for supper and to have a cherry dance with attractive appointments and luxury surroundings sadly the mirror didn 't elucidate whether the attractive appointments and the luxury surroundings were the building or the ladies the men were dancing with national house continued to be a mixed-use building with offices and club rooms such as the Navy military and Air Force club until it was demolished without any fuss in 1970 the site with its neighbor remained vacant for 16 years in 1986 the entire area was acquired by the superannuation Board Western Australia the Bond Corporation and Laurie Connell and partners who planned a 51 storey skyscraper where Viking house once stood the MP Plaza and Western Australian Visitors Centre now stands lost Perth is available at Olga bookshops priced 29.99 _"

    "text": "hi everyone I 'm Amanda Kendall from the thoughtful travelpod cast and this is a presentation series on how to be a better traveler for the city of Joondalup libraries a scope with 19 travel restrictions start to lift it 's a great time to think about how to travel more thoughtfully and this series will help you do just that this presentation is about how to be an authentic traveler and includes tips stories and resources to help you do that first let me tell you what I mean by being an authentic traveler and how I learnt to love this way of traveling so when I was 14 I was super lucky and able to spend a month in Germany as part of a school language trip it wasn 't billed as quote-unquote authentic travel which probably wasn 't even a phrase back then I guess but looking back it really was authentic and that 's one of the reasons I really loved it we got to stay with local families we went to school with our host brothers and sisters early in the morning at a very when I stayed in Berlin I even got taken to reunification celebrations with the family I stayed with we were there for the time when West and East Germany reunited so here are a few pictures you can see here I got to say in a farmhouse near Volk Braille in near Bonn in on the Left they 're very typical German there 's a picture of me and some friends in Berlin in the no-man 's land of the Berlin Wall at the time and then in these pictures you can see where I stayed in noise stat in Bavaria and some goodness I look young but I was saying with a pharmacist and his family in a pharmacy so I got to really see how life everyday life worked there actually it turned out to be very handy as well because I ended up getting an ear infection and he was right there to help me out with what I needed so all of this did feel very very authentic but what about authentic travel not as a student but as an adult so let 's have a some circles the terms being kind of really overused now and lost a bit of its meaning but I don 't really have a better term to describe it so we 're going to stick with calling it authentic travel and I think that authentic travel means having traditional local experiences getting off the beaten path being where fewer tourists are getting somehow getting a better understanding of the local people and their daily lives trying to see things that are not just purpose-built for tourism and usually not in a in a package tour or a big tour although it 's definitely true that some small group to us can be really authentic so let 's have a think about how you can travel authentically the first way is to find some ways to meet local people it 's not always obvious but there 's lots of tips and tricks that we can use to find ways to get in touch with locals and really connect with them when we travel one way is to use the greeter program and Paula from Sydney expert is going to tell us around the world back in 2010 we took a three months overseas trip with our then 11 year old daughter and I spent such a long time planning and I was using travel forums which were pretty new back then hmm and I discovered in this Paris travel forum something about Paris greeters and the fact that it was a free tour with a local and you know when you 're traveling for three months as a family you really kind of do need some free stuff yeah we decided to try and to book one and um I had read that it was quite hard to to get mature but we were lucky and we managed to book a tour for our very first day in Paris and that experience ended up sort of pushing me to keep looking for these sort of tours because we had a fantastic morning with an 80 year old gentleman who he 'd lived his whole life in the Marais and he strolled around with us luckily he we were his relatives you know he 'd never me and he took us to weren 't marked in my guidebook that would just you know like five little stalls in a corner in the back of a street and I couldn 't even find the places on a map that he took us over just really tiny little obscure spots but because it was our first day of a one-week trip he really set us up you know it was where we were staying and he kind of showed me buy your cheese here buy your bread introduce me to that Baker and she made sure we got really good deals every morning well just that level of you know insight there 's no way I could have had the same experience that week in Paris if I hadn 't met him if you 're curious about Paula 's description of the greeter program there 's actually greeters available in many parts of the world and if you 're traveling domestically within an Australia there are greeters set up in Sydney Brisbane Melbourne and Adelaide so far so it is a great way to for free connect with a local person and get to their perspective there are lots of other ways that you can meet local people and good ways to find locals keeping tours as well even if they 're paid tours you can often find you know the right company especially with you know really passionate experienced guides and that can be a really really lovely way to meet locals as well and to really get to know something about their their hometown or home city I actually recommend context to us as well they market themselves as scholarly tours for curious travelers so many of their guides have post-grad qualifications in very specific areas like architecture or you know Hart Fine Arts and so on and so they run really really niche fascinating tours either private tours or small group tours so that 's a really fun way to explore a place as well and otherwise just google and look out for you know small tour companies other ways to connect with local people to show that they 'll show you around their city and yeah lots of different ways to do that now another way to travel authentically is one of my very favorite ways is to stay with friends in other countries and other City and luckily from lots of travel experiences I have a wide network of people who are willing to have me to stay and vice versa of course and so that 's for me one of the best ways but there are lots of other ways to find locals who can stay you can stay with as well one of my favorite ways has been home stays and I 've done that each of the two trips I 've made to Russia here are some pictures of my mum and I when we were staying in San Petersburg with a lovely woman you can see there in the in the center picture called valentina and it was such a such a perfect way to introduce my mum to Russia she got to chat with a woman who you know could explain all of the local you know the local attractions we got a great cafe tip we went back to the cafe she recommended I don 't know how many times at least three that can be amazing across Russia I got to stay in some really interesting home stays with with widows with families with all kinds of interesting locals and it 's definitely a very different way I always remember my very first homestay in Russia landing in Vladivostok in the in the Far East of Russia and we were there in summer but we entered the flat and we could see all of these thick six-week fur coats things like I had never imagined and she said yes quite often the electricity goes out and it will be minus 30 degrees so we need these coats although oh I 'm glad I came in summer so but that was an insight that I wouldn 't have had in a regular hotel or somewhere else to stay so I think that that was well worth the effort it 's a great way to to get to know the local place so any other ways you can stay with locals sometimes Airbnb is is a good way as well there 's often either you know shared accommodation with the host I 'm just it 's advertised that way but in the reviews you can tell that actually they don 't really live there and it 's just a kind of a you know it 's more of a business than anything but if the reviews say you know it was great to spend time with the host and that kind of thing then you can know when I was in Denmark last year I got to know several fabulous locals by saying you know they in their apartments or in their one had a converted basement so we had quite a separate area but we got to chat to them each day as well that was perfect for me because I do like to have my private space especially when I 'm traveling with my son but great to get to know them as well home exchanges can be another interesting way to meet locals you might not meet the locals your home swapping with but you often get to meet their neighbors and stay in a really local area where you 're likely to get to know them and also couchsurfing so incredible setup actually it 's been going for I think nearly 15 years based on a website where people offer up you know so to speak their couches you know anything spare in their house where you can come and sleep for free it 's you know based on a kind of a spirit of spirit of exchange you know if you travel somewhere then you can stay and you know you 'll happily have people come and stay with you as well so actually I now have a little extract from Craig and Linda from the indy travelpod cast who talked about some of their couchsurfing experiences from around the world we have lots of that staying with locals for you there are huge fans of couchsurfing we we didn 't really get into it until that that trip to Chile so we were traveled for about three years in the back to New Zealand and we learned about couchsurfing we 're back in New Zealand for a year and I thought well why don 't we try this we 'll give it a go I think we 're trip in Chile or through couchsurfing and it was spectacular Kosar things been really good to us and the way that we travel we often go somewhere for a few months at a time and so couchsurfing is a great way for us to get into a city stay with locals help have them help us to kind of get oriented and quite often they 're more than willing to tell us that an apartment over here is a terrible idea or you probably want to stay in this area and so that 's been a really useful way there 's a practical example of how we can get under the skin of the city quicker and more easily than we would if we were just kind of booking something on here B&B before we arrived when we were moving into we were traveling around Spain and we were going to be in two places for three or four months each both times we we stayed with the couchsurfing host for the first three or four days and then we moved into an apartment and it was absolutely brilliant in and Diego and then we moved into our apartment and Anna and Diego State our friends and they 're still our friends they kept to visit us one more thing in Berlin and and we 've seen them in Madrid so we 're still friends with them and I think that 's really great another way you can travel authentically is to take some classes when you 're traveling there 's lots of different options and I 've done quite a few different kinds of classes as I travel here 's a couple of examples this is when I was visiting Cambodia and I was in a village outside of Siem Reap and the local group there took us through a quick in class and it was great because it was just the kind of food that they eat regularly it wasn 't you know very fancy and and difficult it was something we cooked together outside and then we all ate together there people from the village and and the group of us who were visiting as well that was both delicious and just so lovely because we got know often some language barriers we had a couple of people there who could translate but you know we also managed to communicate despite the language barriers and they would tell us what to do how to chop what vegetables in what way and so on and it was just a really you know just a really lovely way to really get to know what their daily life was like here 's another example of a class I took this is in northern Thailand up in Nam and it was that a kind of a cultural house and we were being taught how to make these beautiful offerings that they give as offerings at temples so it was tricky as you can see lots of concentration involved but it was just a delightful morning as well so that was something really fun something I wouldn 't have even thought of without you know finding out about it while we were there but that lot of fun and cooking classes probably are some of the most common classes that people take because you know you get to eat something as well home the ability to cook something from another culture so here I have Eva from not scared of the jet lag I found a website of a place called beta city which means my grandma 's house it 's in Amman in the capital of Jordan and it 's actually like a cooking school type place where three sisters inherited the house of my grandma when she died and they wanted to preserve the really really beautiful house in a sustainable way and also kind of do a community project out of it so now you can take cooking classes where a woman from the neighborhood who usually don 't work I guess cook with the tourists cause I think s they offer it for locals and one of the three daughters or granddaughters sort of facilitates the whole event so they translate and they explain a bit here and there and they also take photos which I love because I had my hands dirty but what I 'm so that my camera and with my phone in between so that was really nice yeah and the house is so like she embroidered the furniture and there 's family photos everywhere and it 's such a nice place so if you think taking a class might be a great way to get to know a location more authentically here 's a few ideas for you obviously cooking classes are definitely very popular and I think you know more and more widespread these days arts and crafts you know some of the you know local cultural arts and crafts can be a lot of fun and language classes can be great I 've spoken with lots of people who 've spent you know a few weeks or even longer in a place learning languages in the mornings and then exploring in the afternoon that 's a fabulous way to to have an amazing trip an amazing experience I myself learnt Japanese in several countries around the world in Japan obviously but when I found myself working and living in Slovakia I just found a local Japanese guy there was one who was happy to do a language exchange and that was another great way to have a class and explore something green tea for example in Japan take a class in the tea ceremony with their amazing green teas and you might be converted and I 've also chatted with lots of people who 've taken dance classes around the world particularly in South America or Spain where there 's you know lots of amazing local dancers to try out and lots of classes who are really welcoming to foreigners as well so if you are thinking yes I really want to try and travel more authentically these are my main tips first of all do some research the best way to have an authentic travel experience starts before you leave and evolves you know hanging around on the internet and searching for the kinds of things that you think might be interesting make some personal connections if you can there 's lots of ways to do that both before and during your trip and you might also want to consider the idea of slow travel there 's another video in this series that talks about slow travel so you might want to look at that too because I think spending experience and remember too that authentic doesn 't mean it has to be traditional it doesn 't have to be you know the old customs and habits it can also be how people typically live today and experiencing their everyday life which might be surprisingly similar to your own or it might be really different have a think about how you could be a more authentic traveler on your next trip with a bit of research and preparation you can really dig deeper into a destination and have a much richer experience for it this applies equally whether you 're traveling abroad or domestically within Australia as well happy travels and thanks for watching _"

    "text": "hello friends and welcome to your third singing lesson as part of the triple threat project I hope you 've had a great week and had a chance to practice those new breathing exercises super-important that your power source your breath is feeling really flexible and strong because we 're about to move into our second phase today the sound source so in this video that 's my cat you 're like of course she has a cat she 's a singing teacher I had to start the video again because then my cat went on to make all the noise in the world so I 'm going to try and describe how sound is produced and then how it relates to us as singers so let 's just even start with where the sound comes from so you have a larynx your larynx is connected to the top of your windpipe and it 's responsible for a few different things namely sound production it also serves as the passage the air passage to which air can get in and out of the body and its third function is that or cookie crumbs or water can get into the lungs when you 're swallowing so when you 're eating or drinking and inside of your larynx two beautiful looking bands of elastic tissue called your vocal folds and they lie next to each other and they can open and close and come close to each other and that space between those vocal folds is what 's known as your glottis so that 's your your glottis area and they 're your vocal folds and so those folds love love moving open when you 're taking a breath in and that 's what 's known as been abducted and then when you 're breathing out they have a tendency to want to come closer to each other and also especially when you 're going to be speaking or singing and that 's what 's known as abducted so that 's the area that we 're looking at that actually produces the sound so let 's start with what is a sound so a sound is made when we have an interruption of of the flow of air so when any object enjoy other particles around it and those bump into others make them vibrate and so forth and so forth and we can think of that vibration chain in terms of a singing sound as being sound waves and those energies those vibrations will only happen for as long as there is an energy source to power those vibrations so when you think about dropping a stone into water you 've got that energy source it causes those ripples if you want to think of that the same way in that liquid but at some point those ripples are going to stop because that 's that energy source is no longer producing energy so now the question is how do we get our vocal folds to vibrate so if we come back to that water rippling idea and we were thinking about that in terms of sound waves we can now think about how the sound is produced for us so we have the energy source which is our breath and we now have our vocal folds which are coming close together so that they can get ready to produce a breath is going to want to pass through those vocal folds now if those vocal folds are wide open there 's not much resistance and as a result I might get a very very breathy tone or hardly any toy at all so something like no resistance ah slight resistance ah more resistance and it 's in that effort of the breath trying to get through a really small space that small glottis space that causes those folds to vibrate so they 've got that pressure going gets them and that makes those folds vibrate and you can even feel your folds vibrating for yourself so if you just put your hand around your neck and you just start talking you can just talk or hum over the top of me most my students do I don 't mind you 'll start to notice that you can feel these vibrations happen in your hand every time you talk or hum I can even go one step further from that I can show you the difference between an unvoiced and voiced consonant so we 're going to make the Const in to be no closure of the vocal folds and the other they 're going to try and come together so consonant pare might be for example s and Z so make an S for me you 'll notice no vibration in the hand and now we 're going to make a Zed made in the same way but one where the folds are not resisting that breath and the one where the folds are coming in towards each other so the breath is trying to pass through that smaller space of the glottis you can even try them back-to-back and if you remember I put in a very sneaky exercise in our first video to help you with this concept so now that we know how the sound is being made and why the folds are vibrating we can now look at some of the ideas that are specific to singers so when you 're speaking your folds are vibrating at anywhere between a hundred to three hundred times per second I mean that is just so cool and when we sing a higher pitch they vibrate even faster so higher pitch my vocal folds have to accommodate for that and to do so they lengthen and they get thinner and so I 'm able to hit a higher pitch at the other end if I want to hit a lower pitch they want to shorten and get thicker and so if you 've ever picked up a guitar and how to look at it you might notice that the strings that produce the lower notes are slightly thicker rather than the ones that are at the top that produce those higher notes so that 's a good little way to think of it as well if you 've ever seen any of those or any of those string instruments to compare that to now when we are looking at this vocal fold closure ideally if we can get it to be as efficient as possible I 'm gonna get a really clean sound and by clean sound I mean one that doesn 't have a whole lot of air passing through it now why is that of interest for singers well number one it helps us with our projection that sound to travel in a room or a space or or wherever if I 'm unamplified is going to be hindered by that amount of breath passing through it so the difference between ah it 's not very loud compared to something like ah much fuller time you can think of it like blowing up a balloon and grabbing the edges of that balloon and if you pull those those edges really really firmly you 'll find that that balloon will make a really high-pitched sound as that breath or that air inside the balloon is trying to get through those edges on the flipside if I let go of that tension and that gap with which the air can pass through gets larger we get that sound so that 's why we 're looking at trying to get a beautiful closure of those folds so you might have heard it as being called vocal fold closure or we also refer to it as approximation so if I 've got a big gap unintentionally then I 'm definitely going to be having a breathy sound so maybe you 're 't really have a lot of breath in us in the sound but for some reason when you go to sing you find that you 've got a lot of breath in the sound one of the other things I should point out aside from the projection is you run out of breath you can run out of breath a lot faster so again when we 're looking at this idea of trying to sing through these elongated phrases all the sudden I 've just wasted bags of breath maybe in my first three or four notes and then wondering why I can 't sustain the phrase today 's exercises are going to be focusing on that vocal fold closure and trying to find a really lovely balance through there exercise 1mg we 're going to use a sung ng so for example when you say the word sing sing mm we 're gonna use that lovely song ng go through this phrase now the reason we 're using the ng is that it 's a wonderful tool to be able to figure out the breath balance and vocal fold ng should really highlight to you whether you 're using too much pressure or too little so the patterns going to go like this all on ng and you want to feel like this area is nice and loose to you here we go [Music] lovely [Music] fantastic few more this way [Music] one mole and then we 're gonna come down [Music] right down now and [Music] wonderful [Music] few more [Music] last one gorgeous exercise to the goldilocks on set when referring to onset we 're referring to how the vocal folds are coming together to produce a sound I 'm going to take you through three different types of onsets one is going to be a soft onset so where the breath is passing and then the vocal folds are meeting over the top of that the second one is going to be a hard attack or where we 're using a glottal stop to start the sound and then the third one we 're ideally going to have a mixture of the filling of the two of those on sets so the first example what I breath start moving and then the folds going to come over the top of that breath movement so who on an e-value ready and wonderful now we 're going to do a glottal stop now God will stop is exactly what you 've heard any tennis player do on a tennis court it almost sounds like we are plucking the sound at the vocal fold level and it sounds like this oh I 'll do that again oh let 's see if you can give it a go [Music] did you manage to find it now we 're going to try and put those two on sets back-to-back so who now if you manage to do that you should have had a sensation of where it actually feels your sound is being produced in your throat which is pretty fabulous for a singer because often we 're like I have no idea so now after you 've done those two on sets I want you to see if you can find that one that has a feeling of that breath moving but also a feeling of those folds coming together would have a sound like this oh so it doesn 't have the breath but it doesn 't have that glottal stop that 's starting it as well I 'll do it again oh I 'm gonna give it a go [Music] did you manage to achieve it now we 're going to try and go through the three different ones so who Oh and glottal Goldilocks did you manage to do all three you can practice that on any note so that you 're starting to feel what it feels like for you to bring those folds together in a really lovely balanced _"

    "text": "[Music] hi and welcome back to this our third episode of this wonderful series brought to you by the City of jindal app my name is Nicola Renton and today we 're going to be working on the scene work so a lot of auditions involves scene work and of course when you 're in a play or you 're in a film or a short film this is what you 're going to work on a scene work scene work happens when you and another person or you and lots of other people have a scene together we 're going to specifically be working on do logs it 's a lot easier to do that so it 's you as a character having a conversation with someone else so when you are filming this very often the person is just standing to the side of the camera so we don 't like to look at the camera so I 'm standing to the side of the camera here and you were having that conversation but I don 't want you to do is when you film your audition scenes 't want that at all a nice closed head and shoulder shot will show me your range of emotions so we 're going to look at theatre scene work and we 're also going to look at film and television scene and today you 're also going to hear from a wonderful actor who used to be a student of mine and now is a world-class amazing actor he was in green fields which I got to be the acting coach on which is 147 international awards fleein Graham and he 'll be speaking to me now one was a short film and one was a play so I did a I was in Macbeth and then I also did a short film called growing Jacob 's gold which was through Central TAFE when they and no actually it was actually the only thing that I 've done shot on actual film it 's just the first film I 've ever done on real film so it 's got that graining look and it 's amazing so I found it really exhilarating actually I really just loved working I realized what the audition was like going for either of those both of those I old how old were you I was 12 I was a late developer so I was playing a 10 year old I mean both and so I 'm trying to remember it 's quite a while ago but I was I auditioned for growing Jacob 's goal came through the actors workshop so they contacted Nikola the producers and they were asking about it 's 12 there was a 2 2 kids in it Japanese well for Japanese girl and a mole for a pleasure and so Nicholas sent a whole bunch of kids for to audition for this some really I feel south of the river this is a long time ago um I I auditioned for that and then I got the role and then for my death I might need your help on this one because it was also through because I was playing Lady Macbeth yeah Nicola was playing Lady Macbeth and that 's how I heard and I was playing flounce yeah which is like a minor character and it 's even and they would do it to child actors and it was a lot that you guys had to do a lot of evening performances was amazing fix what was that experience for you you were working with a lot of professionals there was a lot of stage combat that was happening on that on that stage fake blood you know really big personalities that were in that play it the experience was just so enjoyable because I 'm someone who likes learning new things I 'm a curious person so I like to know how things work and especially when you 're a kid the whole world you 're you 're discovering with screens has the preparation for them preparation for them it 's fairly simple you just need to have a blank wall behind you and you need sufficient lighting on your face and a tripod and you can just film on your phone your iPhone smartphone any smartphone any that 's what people in the States film their self takes from home on a clear image with clear sound is all they want and clear lighting really above your head just a little bit above your head that 's because they just want to know if you can act and and what you can bring the facial expressions all that kind of thing I think acting mainly is reacting apart from whoever delivers the first line in a scene I think that 's the only real acting part the way that I think about it because the rest of it it 's sort of there for you you react off that first line this is the first scene that we 're going to look at today between Donnie and Jared and this is the second scene that we 're going to look at today between Cecily and Gwendolyn I would like you to push pause and choose which script that you would like to work on and either take a screen shot for me or print it out and now we can start chances are you 've been asked to read or audition for one of those roles but I 'm quite happy for you to choose either one of those roles as Liam spoke of before 't want two people in front of the camera just one just you and your reader just behind the camera when looking at your scene as Liam spoke about you might not have any context at all for where this has come from which quite often happens in television and film and even short film local short amateur film they 're very protective over their writing and what they 're about to make so very often you just don 't get a lot you might get a little bit of a character description but you might not ii see with Gwendolyn and Cecily is from The Importance of Being Earnest from my favorite place I 've directed this a number of times and I 've been in it as well it 's a it 's a great play lots of information available there 's a great movie you can get the whole script very easily so there 's a lot of ways that you can do research on this the first thing we 're going to do when we get our scene is we 're going to find out the this as we go that 's probably a really great idea what kind of scene is this what type of scene is that theater musical theater film TV is that a drama is it a comedy is it realism is it melodrama this of course will affect the dynamic of the scene the pacing the rhythm and the style of your acting and the choices that you make so it 's really important straight off the bat that you know what you 're auditioning for all right next we 're gonna look at conflict and objective what is the conflict in the scene it 's quite obvious these are both really great scenes with good conflict in them so what does your character actually want I want you to write at the top of the page I want you in the character I want what do you want and of course there 's changes all the way through and so halfway through you might need to change that and say now I want this now I want this it 's important to know what drives your character because that 's is your character 's relationship to everyone else in the scene so in our first scene Donnie is his friend how does he feel about Donnie they 've obviously known each other for a long time best mates I probably think especially if they 're in the same industry they 're invested they 're passionate about the same things what about people that aren 't even present in the scene Jared speaks about Durham and Donnie speaks about Dora what is Donnie 's relationship to Dora what is Jared 's relationship to Dora do you think Dora 's called conflict in their relationship before and of course if you 're doing Importance of Being Earnest this is very important so that we 're talking about Ernest Cecily and Gwendolyn how do they feel about each other definitely with Gwendolyn she 's slightly older than Cecily yes he 's very pretty she walks onto this beautiful country estate and how does she feel how does she feel about this very beautiful young woman who is around her fiance of course feelings are what makes the world go round Liam spoke about is the subtext so with the feelings right in the top of the left corner of the page I feel annoyed I 'm in love I am jealous remember feelings also change all the way through what has happened to your character and just before the scene this is interesting so write down what happens before the scene starts if you don 't know imagine it and try and write it down is it a traffic jam bus long walk fight with girlfriend long day at work delicious dinner with friends so Gwendolyn has traveled from London to this country estate there 's been a long drive possibly in a carriage driven by a horse it might be I was gonna say it might be warm but this is England that we 're talking about so it might be cooler but she was very dressed up she probably tired and here she is walking into the scene hoping to see her fiance earnest you start the scene with an extra layer of context and believability when you walk in with the backstory next thing we 're gonna look at is at the top of the page treiber 's shy nervous to tree confident naive defensive nothing is in auditions I really like it when people dress for the part when I am casting or I 'm looking at an audition piece that 's been sent to me or somebody is auditioning in a room for me I really like when they dress for the part it gives an extra hint to how they are seeing this character but also sometimes I audition for things that are really out of what my agent would normally send me for I remember going for an audition where it was for a mother who was a drug addict and my agent said to me look it 's not really it 's not really for you they don 't really want to see you for this part I just come off a really big tour of a play where I looked really healthy and I was Sun tanned and this really character who had it all together and I had to play this character who had nothing together and everything was falling apart and she said to me I 'll take it as compliment and it and I said it 's not a compliment I 'm a character actress that 's what I do please just just get me that in that audition room and I went to the part so badly and I bruised myself and and made myself look really unwell and dressed for the part and I walked in there and the casting director said to me cut nicly you don 't look well and it 's it 's makeup I I 'm acting I just want to get this in she was like amazing I I was really worried about you and I went in there and I got shortlisted out of lights of actresses to the to the second last person and they didn 't go with me in the end but the director actually phoned me and said I didn 't know you had it in you that that was awesome this is one of my favorite subjects the layers and the subtext I 've touched on it briefly before I mean Jarrod says angrily you don 't get also disappointment himself shaming letting his friends see that he 's quit determination in his decision write out what your character is thinking and the left column throughout the scene even when he 's not speaking one of the greatest thrills of my career is I 've got to see a copy of nicole kidman script from Moulin Rouge and and you should see you should see that that the amount of pencil work she did on her script incredible amount of work that she did on exactly this the layers and the subtext the inner monologue helps you understand your character and what he 's thinking and feeling at any given moment and whether or not he 's saying what he means or he 's masking his emotion I think that is these both these scenes are very rich in in exactly that there 's ah oh so a witness he didn 't tell me that he had a ward how surprising handoffs are very pretty and we 're going to be the best of friends she is feeling very vulnerable at that stage jealous really concerned and confused threatened but you still try to hold that that very particular English upright and facade that she wants to keep on her all the time the words are born out of these thoughts and feelings the subtext it is what spurs on what you say aleem gave us some great information about about that first line he feels as the only acting line and after that we are reacting action reaction is is wonderful to see and that 's really what you 'd love to get in your in your scene that you 're going to send to me or that you 're going to audition with all that you 're working on a play or a short film excellent work again from everyone this week I 've really enjoyed scene work with you so keep going lots of really great scenes that you can find on the Internet to play with from all your favorite TV shows and just keep practicing you 're doing a wonderful job and I will see you next week my grandma and your grandma sitting by the fire my grandma said to your grandma hey now hey now I quite go on they break it down oh come on peanut I 'm nan de hey come on feed on it hey hey come on banana hey hey come on banana hey _"

    "text": "[Music] i 'm jody davidson and we 're going to be working on how to make a three-dimensional form just using some twigs and sticks that you can find when you 're rummaging around in your backyard i have done some pruning recently and I have some really soft wood twigs you will need to get something like this you don 't want them too hard because if they had what 's going to happen as soon as you bend them they are going to break what you 'll also need to do is strips your leaves off something that 's really good about working in the backyard if you don 't have to scraping through the rubbish bin it will all biodegrade and it makes great mulch so get yourself a selection of these are really big grass I 'll break those bits off break off the little side shoots we won 't need those but we might need them later so we 'll just put me down to the side and strip your leaves off you 'll need probably around five or six of these some of these tears out you can also use it a pair of scissors if you like some of this softer ones we 'll just pull off and again I 'll strip those moves now this is quite a long one so we probably won 't use the full length it 's a bit you can see there it 's getting a bit hard to bend so if I 've been there did you likely you can hear it 's starting to break that 's what you don 't want we want this soft about now what we 're going to be doing is making a set of circles so we 're going to turn them into a circle keep them really just a little push it just seems to break up the fibers and then you 're going to twist them around until you get a circle when you get to the other edge just sit around and what you want to do is make up about five circles of the same size like that I 'd like you to go away get your collection of sticks and come back once you how we can piece those together to start making our three-dimensional form by now you should have your collection of sticks that you 've made into a circle I have done a few extras but I 've also done some small ones these are because these it 's always handy to have a couple of different sizes and I 'll show you why when we start to assemble the other thing you might like to have is some string you can do it if you 've made your own string and I 've done another workshop where you can make your own string but sometimes it is easier if you got a ball of string you could also use wool you could use them cotton anything that just enables you to tie it together so I 'm going to catch just a few lengths of those who don 't need to be too long about the length of your hand is usually enough now on there quite a few so I will cut maybe ten pieces but them came for two ends here it 's an easy capture the time is your join so where your circles are crossing they 'll be a joint so this join this join every way that where there is a join you need to time it 's a bit like a jigsaw you want to find the pieces that fit nice and snugly so that one actually fits a bit better than the other one so I 'm going to tie those in together when you 're tying it 's like doing a Christmas present you need to wrap around and then you need to cross over and go around again and then tying a knot so you want to do that on all your crosspoint I 'll do another one here you can if you want to tie it in a single knot that way and then go around on the diagonal and tie it again now don 't worry about this bit because we 're going to weave that bit in I 'll get another one and again now this is where you have to figure out what can you feed it on the outside of your circles or sometimes you might doesn 't matter but you want to be where there 's the most pressure so you want it 's sort of pushing out or pushing in on itself so again I 'm going to do on the cross points I 'm going to wrap it around again and tie and this just stops it from sliding it makes it much easier to work with but you might like to keep these as a ball as a circle put in the garden you could actually utilize this technique and turn them into maybe birdhouses to hang you could put some little battery-operated tea light candles in there 's lots of different ideas for them you can also make them they don 't have to be round they could be more oval you could make it flat face so really use your imagination for they go magic for another one through the middle I 'm doing just moving it around so it 's to swish against the other ones she what I might do if I 'm going to rather than go at the top here I 'm actually gonna tie these bit bigger when you 've finished the string that we 're using you can actually go through and cut it a lot because it 's only there at the beginning to hold it together [Music] not you 're smaller tweet that I said at the beginning about cutting off these ones we 're going to use these to weave in so this is where you start to get the structure of your shape or your circle I 'm just taking the leaves of some of those and we also I didn 't mention this our smaller ones so this we 'll go either on the top see on the inside of the higher part of the circle now you can see I 've got this little bit I 'm actually gonna weave that through I 'll just attach these and if you 'd like to go away and start putting yours together and then come back and I 'll show you how we then start weaving and making a structure loss of it all right so we have now done vertical and our horizontal supports and I 've put the the smaller one at the other end but I thought I 'd show you how you can just weave it through instead so where we 've got a little gap you can just poke it through the gap just like a pie a little bit and poke it through this is where our weaving starts to happen you 'll see I 'm just pulling that around you don 't want to bend your sticks too much because if you bend them they 're going to break so just like we did our first circles what I 've done is put that around that top section then I 'll get in and join up exactly the same as we did when we 're making uh circles by wrapping it around what is good is that you can actually wrap this around your joins as well so just crossing over so you have your ball now we still have this bit don 't worry exactly any bits that are sticking out like that we 're going to weave in your idea now is to make this into a solid so using our to do is under and over you can go in any direction you like just making them a Neela if you have a gap and you want to put it through the gas well you 've got two pieces that have woven together poke it through that it just holds it in place and keep pulling it around under and over and what that 's doing is it 's putting resistance so it 's pushing or pulling all the different parts when you get some really soft bits like this you can again just wrap them around to keep the new place I 've actually got a really big one here so I 'll show you that this is really large when you get the thicker end you need to be careful like I said they will break just give them a little Bend just break some of those fibers on the inside and then again you can start with the end and and over and you 'll feel it starting to press against the structure you wouldn 't keep feeding it through because as soon as you 've been to break keep feeding through and when you get to these elusive sections then you can start the idea is to continue this you can twist it around you get to know the tweaks that you 're using and how much they will Bend you just keep twisting under over under over and again if you 've got any bits that you 've twisted when you paint your circles you can take them into that as well they 're quite firmly held together so they 're really good for holding your pieces now if you have something like this bit as your form starts to become full you can then step to the pocket underneath in places you want it to be giving that resistance so that it 's not going to come out again you want to be able to wrap it around a little bit this one here will do the same and you can see you 're starting to get this three-dimensional form you can continue until it 's solid you can stop partway through it you might like to have a solid base and just have this to make a vessel so to make a 2 Bowl so if you 're going to do that we do the same thing you might have your sticks that go up and you can fold them back in haven 't_''_843.149 played with that I 'd love to see some of the structures that you cannot breathe you 'll find it 's quite addictive I love it and in one of my other videos I 'll show you how you can use this along with some other found objects to make an actual creature [Music] you [Music] _"

    "text": "[Music] hi everyone it 's Lachlan again and welcome back to another city of jewel of Arts an isolation project dance edition this video is all about turning and how dancers can do so many turns make it look so easy before you think I can 't do this I 'm gonna skip it anyone can learn to turn all you need to do is learn a few simple tips and tricks the one thing you need to know above all else stop turning it 's science we 're using a term called centripetal force think of turning like a toy spinning top that you might have had when you were younger like this now there 's some things that we notice that helps this top spin as its spinning on its axis gravity is sending down however usually made out of plastic it 's forcing itself back up so this is idea that force is going against itself that helps return also you notice that as something turns it is compact and strong meaning that it is working inwards of itself because normally when something turns if you 've want to spread out but to control that you have to come here and remain compact and furthermore to remain compact and to be thinking up the catalyst for your movement or the way that you start your turn is just as controlled as the way you maintain it I 'm going to explain those three different concepts in this video today I want you to make sure that you 've warmed up using your cardio your stretch and your conditioning and then come and join with the rest of the beams okay so when it comes to turning the first thing that we need to talk about is something called spotting spotting is when you keep your eyesight focused on one particular point in the room as you 're turning your body and then you snap your head back to find that same point this helps you remain balanced and it also helps you not get dizzy when you 're turning one skill that you can do and you can practice is to just walk on the spot as you practice your spotting you can see that I 'm speeds to test that spotting Theory [Music] okay so now the fun part we 're gonna break down all the different things you need to think about as you do a turn so the first exercise is working on our general rises so you 've got to have strength in your ankles and your feet to be able to hold your entire body weight or one foot as you do a turn so what you can do is you can practice doing some risers on your toes as I 'm doing it I 'm not putting all my weight into my hands I 'm trying to just help myself balance and you see I 'm going up and holding and then coming back down now I would recommend doing this for at least sets of ten taking a little break and then going back again now as you 're doing it you want to think about what your core is doing as you 're rising up and coming back down you 're not always going to have something to help you go up and down so after you 've done risers try to take your hands out and test your balance you can see I 'm testing my balance by lifting my arms up and down something that 's really important as you 're working on this exercise is to find your stability in a parallel position that means that your feet are like that on two train tracks and they 're hip-width apart now as I 'm going up and down you can see I 'm playing with what I 'm doing with my arms as I work on my balance I 've got my arms to the side I 'm trying to above my head I 'm making sure to keep them in my peripheral vision now my peripheral vision it means that I can see it just from the side of my eyes something that a lot of people don 't really think about when they 're turning is what their back does so an exercise to test that balance is what I call pushing yourself out the pull you can see my back muscles are engaged and that 's going to help me keep my stability ankles a little bit more you can try doing some raises on one foot and the other remembering not to use all your weight forward on those hands another exercise as you go from two feet swap to one and come back down or just staying up and testing where that center of your balance is now there are different ways that we turn or different directions there 's backwards and forwards now ballet terminology we would use is this is an on day ORS meaning backwards and then under dawn which means to come forward before we get into our actual turning you want to make sure that you have an awareness of what your body does as you open up to do a turn alternatively what your body does as you come forward to do a turn where 's your momentum so what I like to do is just use my arms and my legs and not really worry about landing properly now don 't you forget about all the extra things we did when we were holding the chair you don 't want to stick that booty want to make sure that you engage everything and keep that strength remember gravity is pushing you down so you want to send the energy back up so we are thinking about the ankles the backs of the knees the hips and also what our back is doing now one thing that a lot of people think they need to do is send all their energy when they 're going to return rushing the energy from behind like a runner going forward that 's actually the opposite of what you should think about doing keep the weight as much as you can over the front leg and all you have to worry about is rising up and this actually helps with your turn if you try and send the energy from the back to the front then you 're actually sending too much of that force forward where you should be sending it upwards which is actually not helpful now an exercise that I like to do to really check how everything is in alignment it 's just a very simple preparation for turn so you see then I 'm me keeping my weight forward and then bring the other foot to raised position so we 're going to slow that down and I 'm going to talk about the mechanics as we do this together so we 're going out to the side in a parallel position this foot that went to the side then reaches behind the body as it reaches behind the body you 're sending the same arm as the leg that went behind you in front the arm that remains out to the side is still in that peripheral so you can see it from the side and then you 're sending your weight up and not forward remember a turn is only a rise which changes direction so do yourself a favor and make sure that you keep that weight nice and central and then back to a parallel position you can do this a couple of times on the right and on the left I 've slowed it right down so you can see how much detail goes into it and remember this much detail is really just to make sure that it turns sending that weight up and also bringing the arms the shoulders and the pelvis into a nice strong striving upwards position I 'm showing you from the back here as well you can see that my arms my weight my hips everything is in a clean line movement now the best thing about doing this exercise slowly is also a really helpful way to just sort of engage those muscles and teach them when to engage when we start to move faster and from the side there you can see my weight staying forward over that leg which is going to do the rising up and I 'm showing you just from the other side here I 've done a quick reverse on the camera just so you can practice now remember there is no such thing as doing some things too many times to be able to get that skill up today showing from the side here again my weight is forward my core is engaged I 'm sending the energy up as gravity is sending me down you can do this as many times as you like step that we 'll do is the same exercise except we 're going to add a slight rise and a controlled landing remember as you go up you 're still doing everything that you did from the earlier exercise which is to keep everything controlled we send our body out to the side the same arm as the same leg comes forward and we rise up bringing everything into a control position and remember to control down when exercise I like to do here is really think about what 's my belly button doing is it driving back and down through the back of the leg or is it going forward which is the opposite of what I wanted to do now remember you can do this as many times as you like and it 's okay if you make mistakes or have little wobbles because that 's what we do when we dance is we try and then we repeat so you can see here I 'll point out how I made my mistake I sent my body weight too far backwards so when I came forward I had I couldn 't fix it so when I did the same side again keeping that weight forward and up I go a much more controlled position and then keeping that control in mind as I send the energy out to the left side and keeping the weight forward you can see that I maintain that control again on both sides now the gradual graduation from this is to do a half turn we 're doing all the same things but all we 're doing is we 're picking up the body and snapping our head to do a 180 degree turn I 'll show you that on the left now you 've seen that I 've done a little hop there a hop is not an ideal thing to do because it 's saying to your body that you 're okay to fall out of your turns now I do that on that side but I want to show you that you can 't always get it right and that 's why we 've got to practice it and then we evolved from doing our half turns to doing our that we worked on together at the beginning and you can try and go for the double and it 's okay before well thanks so much again for joining in today 's video I hope you something interesting or maybe someone who maybe not thought about before when it comes to Tanya now remember this is only a small piece of the puzzle when it comes to becoming a better dancer so keep practicing these skills at home one thing that I can suggest to help you improve even faster by practicing home is to ask someone in your family or someone in your community who 's close by to be able to kill you as you work on these skills the best thing we can do when it comes to working on increasing our technique is to watch back how we 're doing if you 're not comfortable sharing that with other people don 't worry just set up the recording device that you have access to record yourself and watch it back don 't forget to do it from different angles from the front from the side to thank you so much for watching today and I look forward to seeing you all in class soon remember just wait now before you go anywhere Stephanie Nicola and myself are taking online submissions for our upcoming master class you might be wondering what a master class is so in our master class we 're going to be taking individuals from the community and work with them to develop their skills in the arts while still remaining in isolation so if you would like a little bit of extra help from me when it comes to your dancing or in developing your performance or working on your personal style or anything dance related whether you have never danced before or you 've been dancing your entire life doesn 't matter we want to help you I especially want to ask any of our future trippled threader 's out there that 's a singer a dancer and an actor all in one to let us know how we can help you send a submission video of yourself doing a little bit of movement and also ask them for a little bit project we 're really looking forward to getting to work with a couple of people in their coming weeks whatever you need send us video link and we 'll help you out remember everyone just keep dancing _"

    "text": "hi everyone I 'm Amanda Kendall from the thoughtful travelpod cast and this is a presentation series on how to be a better traveler for the city of Joondalup libraries as conferred 19 travel restrictions start to lift it 's a great time to think about how to travel more thoughtfully and this series will help you do just that this presentation is about how to be a slow traveler and it includes tips and stories to help you do that you might be wondering what is this thing we 're calling slow travel to start off with I thought I 'd give you a few definitions because there 's no one exact way to describe slow travel for some people it 's a mindset some people it is really about being slow and deliberate but I think that these definitions will give you some ideas of how you might become a slow traveler so this one 's from the Macmillan dictionary and they describe slow travel as traveling long distances over land and sea rather than by plane especially because you 're concerned about the environment or because you a fairly literal definition but one that definitely is part of being a slow traveler the Urban Dictionary says slow travel is a type of travel where a traveler spends a long period of time in one place whereby they grow a stronger sociological and qualitative experience by getting to better know a certain location and its inhabitants this is opposed to general travel work travel or holidaying or vacationing so I quite like this idea of getting to know a location and its inhabitants the local people better for me that 's a really important part of slow travel and there 's this definition as well from the art of slow travel calm and they say slow travel is a mindset that rejects traditional ideas of tourism and encourages you to soak in your environments and keep yourself open to new experiences so I think all of these sum up pretty well what slow travel means to me but if you want to be more of a slow traveler well what can you do I 've put together a few ideas of how to be a slow traveler with a slow traveler is to spend a longer time in fewer destination it 's hard to get used to at first because often we 're trying to cram as much in as possible but I really recommend trying it out and seeing how you feel here 's some examples from my own slower travels last year I took my then nine-year-old son to Denmark to Copenhagen now once we knew we 're going to Copenhagen we started to look on the map and think oh we could go and spend some time in Sweden and we could go down to Hamburg in Germany and see this other museum and we could do this and this and this it was really tempting but I knew that we enjoy our trips more when we spend a longer time in fewer places and so I did and we had time to really look around so you can see on some of these pictures from our Copenhagen trip we really got to know what it was a little bit of what it was so light was what it 's like to live in Copenhagen the apartment where we rented we could ride our bikes everywhere and we could see how other people live for example the bike with kind of I don 't know the big trailer on the front of the bike so they could do all their shopping or put their kids in it and we also had plenty of time to actually look around parts of Copenhagen and nearby so these pictures are from the Louisiana art gallery an amazing Museum about an hour north of Copenhagen but because we weren 't in a rush and we had a good chunk of time in Copenhagen we could spend the whole day here it meant my son could enjoy the amazing parts of the children 's house with all these incredible activities rather than rushing or and rushing through because we had to get somewhere else another way you can be a slow traveler is to challenge the idea of the bucket list or especially the ticking off of sightseeing spots way of travelling the kind where you think I must see the Eiffel Tower and the Arc de Triomphe and I London and tick-tick-tick just because they 're famous and you 've heard of them instead try and go for some experience you 'll travel for example in Japan a couple of years ago rather than racing around to hit all the main cities we didn 't even go to Tokyo at all focused on some of the experiences that are really a part of Japan so as you can see we made sure we got to ride a Shinkansen or bullet train and we got to enjoy a lot of the food so here is us eating some amazing ramen in Kyoto similarly if you 're going to go to the famous spots like here we are at fushimi inari a famous temple in kyoto try and time it so that you 're not with all of the crowds and you 'll feel a bit slower about it so we went early in the morning on a fairly overcast day and as you can see by the picture on the right especially there 's plenty of moments when we weren 't in a crowd and that makes it a whole the big bonuses of slow travel of course there are going to be times when you really do want to see one of those important sightseeing spots here we are in Cambodia visiting Angkor Wat and yeah there 's a bit of a crowd there because everyone wants to see and call what at sunrise but I decided we really did too so I think the point is if you want to go to those really famous places do it mindfully do it because you know you really want to go there see if you can find a better way to do it at a bit better time of year or a better time of day and just know that it 's something you 're going to do because you really want to see it for some reasons not just because it 's what everyone does the other way you can be a slow traveler is to make sure you include some unplanned time for some spontaneous exploration I try and get scheduled only maybe half of the time with vague plans even when I 'm traveling and make sure appeals to us at the time so for example last year I was in Cannes for a conference and I always make sure even if I 'm traveling to work for work to add some extra time and I had an extra day on the end of my trip where I knew I would have seen a fair bit of cannes and surrounds already but I just wanted a day to wonder and you can see what I wanted to I wanted to some markets the rust-eze markets I had an amazing almond croissant because by this time I 'd been asking around some locals and figured out what was the tastiest thing I could find there and I could stroll along the foreshore and see every swimming there as well and those are the kind of things that you often don 't get to see if you 're rushing around only trying to hit all of the main sights another example is quite a few years ago in Vienna I was traveling with my son who was younger then and he had an obsession with rubbish trucks now I a really beautiful and famous cathedral in the middle of Vienna and we nearly got to it we came up out of the metro and we should have turned left I could see the cathedral just nearby but he heard a rubbish truck and he 's like let 's follow it and so instead of going to Stefan storm to the Cathedral we wound their way through some of the side streets of Vienna following the rubbish truck and you know it 's kind of a crazy way to travel but it was a really lovely way to see some of Vienna and that 's a different kind of travel I think more memorable certainly more enjoyable for my son as well and that 's the benefits of some of the ideas of slow travel but don 't just listen to me I 've got some other voices here to talk about slow travel these are some words from some travel friends of mine around the world and what they think about slow travel what I love most about the about the hiking I think is that it 's sort can 't hardly go slower than that and so to me that 's where it 's also the most beautiful because you have the time to see all those details you know you have to watch what 's in front of your feet and of course sometimes you should remember to look up and you know take it all in but you can 't see all these details like all the animal tracks that we saw in the desert and you know I I would always make up those stories in my mind who chased whom and you know you can see a bird landing like the footprints of the bird and the tracks of that lizard suddenly stop and disappear so apparently it 's been eating and you know if you were riding a court or a motorbike through there you wouldn 't see any of that and you know walking is actually a nice speed to take and all these details and you know I don 't know look at the flowers and see the animals and because you 're also hardly making any noise as long as actually see wildlife here and there on my first trip to Morocco I actually saw desert foxes when I was just but that was when I was just hiking like just going for a walk with two off the crew to get some water or something and we had just one camera with us and we came over the top of the dune and on the top of the next one there were two desert foxes and you know they both of the guys just turned around and pointed to show me and I had already seen them and that was so excited and I think you know traveling any other way that wouldn 't have happened well one of the things that it was helpful for me dropping the kids to learn how to slow down yes you know I I was the type of you know when I was a solo traveler I was one of those that 's like you know I get you know pretty basic hotel room because I 'm gonna spend pretty much no time there except sleeping because I 'm going to be see absolutely everything I possibly can squeeze into this short vacation time that I have and you know just go go go go and I saw it won right you know by Tonya leave you 're just often you 're just kind of wore out and traveling with the child you have to do a different pace and you have to allow more time to have Chilton where they 're just you know going to relax at the hotel or you 're just going to you know do a shorter walk or you know find a closer place to eat or whatever you know this whole concept of slow travel which I could probably talk about ad nauseam but you know I was just reading something the other day and and it sort of miss I don 't know frustration builds up inside of me somebody had written oh yeah well you know how to do Prague in a day and I eat myself what do we sell how do we do a city like how do you do Rome in an afternoon like it so it 's just such know I think people want to because they want to go home and say well I went to Rome I went to Prague I saw Florence I would enter and they want to just list off place names it 's all I think that 's the unfortunate part and of course you know you know you got to be in Japan for two years and you know I got to go traveling for a couple of years just recently and so you know we had that privilege or at least we built it into our lives to have a very different travel experience and of course for lots of people certainly in North America you starred on two weeks vacation a year yes you 're just like whooping it and if you 're going to go off to Europe well already there 's a day there and a day back and and you 've got to do yeah exactly you do have to do Prague in a day I know so and I don 't think people would go let 's just go to Prague for two weeks you know except watch then you 'd really get to understand a lot more about a place it 's the opposite to how my husband and I traveled when we first started exploring the world we did the very typical early twenties thing of hitting Europe to eight weeks and seeing as much as possible you know and it was like what day is it oh this must be Amsterdam then how many churches have we seen I don 't like what church I don 't know what 's this I have no idea you know it 's like like sure we 'll figure it out later exactly you know and it don 't get me wrong it was amazing and we saw so much that we wouldn 't have been able to see we didn 't have the money we didn 't have time or the you know the experience or anything to to go deep into places like that we were very much on the backpacker trail and it was so much fun it was an incredible time but the older we got and the more I think it 's and the places that we go we really prefer to go deep into one place rather than shallow into a number of places so we just for example would spend a month in Canada and we base ourselves in one town for almost an entire month and we get an apartment where we like a proper apartment where we can cook all our meals and unpack our bags and live there you know and really really feel like we live there and what we discovered after doing that once was that we we get to know a place in a completely different way it 's not I 'm not saying it 's necessarily better or worse than then traveling through a big area in a shorter period of time but I think you just get to know a place in a different way you know I do things like go to the library if we stay in a place for a while like I love going to local libraries and just me too yes you know I meaning it is you really get a much better sense of the community place just by sitting around people who lives there you know and having conversations in the coffee shop and going back to the same coffee shop a few times and yeah I mean to me it 's and it doesn 't have to be spending a month in a place you can relate you can travel like that over a weekend I think it 's just more a willingness to give up covering a lot of ground in order to go deeper into a place and explore one or two things rather than ten have to think about ways you could be a slow traveler on your next trip it 's a normal feeling to want to make the most of it when we travel but perhaps you 're making the most of it could look different now I know I 'm looking forward to some slow travel trips in Western Australia in the next few months I just can 't_''_907.12 wait so happy travels and thanks for watching _"

    "text": "birth then and now is published by London publisher pavilion books the venom now series covers nearly a hundred towns and cities from all over the United Kingdom America and Australia I was invited to write the Perth edition in 2015 and what follows is a small selection of subjects from the book from very humble and difficult beginnings in 1829 Perth has evolved into an exciting beautiful and cosmopolitan city full of evidence of its past and promises for its future soon after the first Swan River Colony settlers arrived James Stirling issued a proclamation declaring that British statute law and common law would apply to the new colony with Stirling initially as the sole arbitrator at first Court was held in the rush church on the corner of hay and Irwin streets but in 1836 a courthouse to a design by Henry revelry was built the design of the building was described by Rev Lee as chaste and appropriate and cost 698 pounds to build the first court of general quarter sessions was held there on the 2nd of January 1837 for the first few years of its but also as the colony 's theatre concert hall school and church the Perth drill hall you can see in the photograph next door to the courthouse was built in 1896 as a response to a perceived need for better military training as the colony grew so did the workload of the court which often sat for 18 hours a day in 1841 it was reported in the Perth Gazette that a criminal trial ended at 3 a.m. and only after the accused had had to rouse the jury to listen to his defence by 1879 the caseload became impossible to accommodate in the Old Courthouse and judicial matters transferred to the commissariat stores next door the Old Courthouse then became the residence for the government Gardiner from 1905 until 1965 the building was used as the arbitration court but it eventually became the old courthouse Law Museum the drill hall next door was demolished to provide extra parking for the courthouse almost immediately after the foundation of Perth in August of 1829 the colonial botanist James Drummond set up a naturalization garden somewhere within the area of what is food crops he brought with him from England in order to discover what would and wouldn 't grow successfully in the unknown soil and climate in addition to the vegetable and fruit varieties Drummond propagated he also planted some acorns from which to oak trees don 't to be seen in the garden grew the garden was gazetted as a botanical garden in 1845 PERTs first public garden a year later it was leased to Henry coal until returning to government control in 1856 looking towards the river the governor 's jetty can be clearly seen on the left side of the photograph in the foreground are the early sections of the central government offices and beyond the garden of the courthouse on the left and the commissariat stores the park continued to be the city 's botanic gardens until the Kings Park Botanic Garden was established in 1962 three years later the old Botanic Gardens underwent a makeover with two J stone retaining walls and shallow pools one of which has a much photographed group of bronze kangaroos at the water 's edge the area was renamed Stirling Gardens minerals an obelisk erected in 1971 this consists of a 14 meter oil drill pipe threaded with 15 different Western Australian ores it represents the natural wealth of the state the two original oak trees can be found amongst the central block of trees in this picture the king 's head hotel the first licensed hostelry in central perth was opened by william dixon in 1830 a year later Dickson reassigned the property to William leader and it became known as leaders hotel which was frequented by the Gentry of the colony as well as the military officers the hotel had a very good reputation and many grand dinners and celebrations took place there the building was extended in 1845 and began to be referred to as the Freemasons tavern as it accommodated the first Freemasons Lodge in Western Australia still in the ownership of William leaders widow fire destroyed several outbuildings at the rear of the hotel in 1888 by which time it is said the entire property was in a very dilapidated State the hotel was sold in 1894 to jondor born an American property investor in hotel to design a new hotel of the highest quality no expense was spared in gathering the best materials from around the world to create the luxury establishment he envisaged the Palace Hotel as it was renamed proudly boasted electric light and gas laid on in every room the Commonwealth Bank Corporation purchased the property around 1972 and announced it was to be demolished this caused a public uproar and a campaign for the building 's preservation was led by the group known as the palace guards in 1978 the Bond corporation purchased the property and the adjacent ones building a 50-story office block which sits on the northeast corner of the original building much of the original hotel did however survive this addition and was used as a bank in 2015 the old building underwent an extensive renovation program converting it into offices amongst the most important permanent buildings required by the fledgling Swan River Colony was a commissariat store in which two gathered government supplies like the courthouse this building was designed by Henry revelry and completed in July 1835 it had a large door opening on the river transferred from river boats and barges and a rather grand a classical portico on the other side as a main entrance the building continued as stores until it was converted into a court building in 1879 however working conditions in the former store were not comfortable with complaints continually being made to the Legislative Council about how cold it was in winter and stuffy in summer parliamentary debate about the need or not for the new law courts dragged on throughout the 1890s with no firm conclusion being reached the death knell for the commissariat stores was finally sounded in 1898 when Parliament was told the jury room was so badly constructed that their deliberations could be overheard in other parts of the building in 1901 plans were made to construct a new Supreme Court building on the site of the old stores and reclaim a section of the river to create a new public park the new building was designed by the principal architect of the Public Works Department John Granger he was the father of the well-known composer Percy Grainger soon after the work began in 1901 difficulties much criticism in the local press and a Royal Commission to look into the problem the matter having been settled a foundation stone was laid in June of 1902 with the official opening eventually taking place omits much pomp and ceremony a year later this gathering on the esplanade reserve in 1898 was to watch a march pass to celebrate Queen Victoria 's 79th birthday the esplanade reserve was reclaimed from the river as part of a city council scheme to provide more spaces for moral amusement and manly sports work to create the new land between barek am William Street jetties began in 1873 by the dumping of dredging x '_''_534.87 from the river it was eventually completed in the early 1880s when soil removed to levelsand Georges Terrace was added initially an open drain running down show wood core made the ground a very unpleasant place to be once this had been covered in the recreation ground officially came into use in 1885 the Queen 's March passed attended by over six thousand people was one of the many such events which took place on the Esplanade in clubhouse of Perth Yacht Club and a very sparsely populated South Perth by the beginning of the 20th century the recreation ground was home to cricket bowling and tennis clubs with Perth Yacht Club alongside the ground also became the venue for civic and national ceremonies such as the celebration of Australian Federation on the 1st of January 1901 with some alterations in the 1920s the Esplanade reserve remained as popular as ever for sporting and cultural events in more recent times plans to redevelop the Esplanade were mooted to reconnect the city centre with its River in 2011 the state government announced the creation of Elizabeth key to provide a waterside amenity including an inlet from the river a pedestrian and cyclists bridge and other leisure facilities the key was officially opened on the 29th of January 2016 with spanda a rippling water inspired sculpture as its centerpiece eventually the empty areas will be occupied by high-rise buildings dwarfing the bell tower on the left of the photograph South Perth on the opposite side of the river has also grown since the earlier photograph was tight can the introduction the local labor force it also brought to our shores the personnel required to supervise and guard the prisoners the enrolled pensioner force traveled on the convict ships as guards on arrival in Western Australia they were offered a choice of 10 acres of land with which to make a living or the opportunity to continue work as guards for those who continued as guards accommodation was required and so a pensioner barracks was designed by architect Richard ropes Jewell and constructed mainly by convict labour working on laying the foundations commenced in February of 1864 and by April the Enquirer newspaper reported the pension of barracks is beginning to make a show the walls being several feet high the first families moved into their to room departments in 1866 each family apartment had two rooms about 13 feet by 11 with at least one fireplace later the building was extended to house an additional 21 families additional facilities at the back of the barracks included a cook house firing range and gun room washhouse stores stables and later a five escort this photograph was taken in 1866 just before is no glass in the windows transportation only lasted for 18 years but in that time some 2,500 guards and their families came to live in Western Australia the force was disbanded in 1887 and the barracks was slowly converted into government offices in 1960 the government announced the barracks was to be demolished to make way for the new Kwinana Freeway which runs in a cutting behind the arch this produced a public outcry on the raw Western Australian Historical Society formed the barracks defense council to save the building despite this demolition commenced and two Bay 's of windows were reduced to rubble attention then turned to saving the gatehouse arch after several polls to gauge public opinion all of which were conclusively in favor of retention a free vote was taken in Parliament and a motion to demolish the arch was defeated by eight votes this left us with an unoccupied building which is really Perth 's answer to the arc de triomphe defiantly standing in front of the Parliament House the first gold rush bought a huge population explosion to Perth which necessitated the creation of reliable public transport system became an imperative during the last half of the 1890s a number of newspaper correspondents suggested a tram system would fill this need after much debate about the initial route Hay Street was decided upon and work to lay the tram lines commenced at the end of January 1899 by early July of that year the Kalgoorlie minor was able to announce the first test run of a tram had taken place and the line would be open in a couple of months as can be seen from this picture the reason for the speed was the number of people working on the project the opening of the first tram service in Perth operated by Perth Electric tramways Limited took place on the 28th of September 1899 a report the following day in the West Australian suggests that it caused quite a stir the principal event in the city yesterday was undoubtedly the opening of the Hay Street tram cars to traffic from an early hour in the morning till late at night the cars ran at short intervals and with but few exceptions were crowded sprinkling of those who made the trip were induced by the novelty rather than the necessity to make the journey and this of course largely augmented the traffic the comfort and convenience of the trams coupled with the speed at which they traveled formed an almost universal topic of conversation amongst the passengers as the city grew so did the tram system which weaved its way through a number of verbs after World War two the system was considered old-fashioned so it was replaced by trolley buses with the last tram running in August of 1958 this isn 't Georges Chambers building on the site where it once stood was the old st. George 's Cathedral the old cathedral was opened to st. George 's Church in January 1845 and elevated to the status of Cathedral when the Anglican Diocese of Perth was formed in 1858 with the construction of the new cathedral 30 years later the old church was demolished in 1891 after the demolition plans were made to develop an office building on the site this would be both an administrative centre for the diocese and a source result it was designed by JJ Talbot hops and constructed in 1897 at a cost of about 3,100 pounds st. George 's Chamber remained until the late 1970s when it was demolished to make way for a new law chambers building which was opened in 1981 once heralded as Perth 's ugliest modern building two-thirds of it was demolished in 2012 as part of the cathedral square redevelopment in its place is the stunning new perth city library building designed by local architect kerry hill the seven storey purpose-built library is the first major civic building since the construction of the first concert hall over 40 years ago the new library which complements the classical and gothic architecture of the old central government offices and st. George 's Cathedral has helped to transform an area of the city formerly inhabited by down-and-outs and skateboarders into a vibrant focal point for community events and activities so Georges Terrace was initially called King George 's Terrace after King George the fourth by the time era Smith drew a map of the town in 1833 it was referred to as Sint Georges Terrace to ensure standards were maintained a regulation was passed in 1833 stipulating only homes costing at least 200 pounds could be built on this street and as a result it became a fashionable residential and business area various improvements to the street were carried out in the 1870s and 80s including leveling and the addition of a footpath but it was the newfound Gold wealth of the 1890s that transformed the architecture out of all recognition and removed most of the residential properties on the immediate left of this photograph stands the United Services Hotel and on the right is world chambers containing the trade protection Association following the first gold boom and during the Great Depression of the 1930s few changes were made to the late 19th century elegance of the terrace the Western Australian mineral boom after the Second World War was to change all that a need for a significant increase in office accommodation coupled with an internationally held disregard for the significance of 19th century architecture brought about the disappearance of buildings which today would be considered important examples of their time the United Services Hotel building weld chambers made way for the same Martin Center in 1978 and at about the same time the street name lost its apostrophe once the 19th century charm of the west and the end of the terrace has disappeared the area certainly gives the feel of a busy capital city CBD Perth then and now which went on to the Australian bestseller list soon after publication is available from all good book shops at 29.99 _"

    "text": "[Music] hi everyone welcome to my garden my name is Jodi Davidson and today I 'm going to show you how to make string or grow using some things that you probably have around the house at home I 'm starting weed and audition and also a pillowcase this was no good anymore it had some stains and marks on it so it would have gone into the rubbish bin but rather than said something to landfill I thought it would be much more exciting to be able to do something with it so what I 've noted you to get started is strip my fabric into thin strips just by cutting some little roots and caring you should catch them as well but I tend to be a little bit impatient what I 'd like you to do is go away and collect your materials get them together strip them all up and then come back and I 'll show you how we can use those to twist and turn and make them straight see you soon so as you can see I 'm back I have my t-shirt which we will then use for upstream when you 're making string you can use two strands three strands or sometimes you can use more than that depending on how thick your wanting to make it I 'm only going to make a two strand string the process is exactly the same whichever one you are doing but I find that using two strings is a little bit easier to manipulate a couple of pieces there so to start with what I 'll do is show you using our pillow case now this fabric doesn 't stretch it has no stretch where is your t-shirt we will have stretch so what you 'll need to do is get two pieces of fabric it is easier if you start with a similar length just because you can join them on to make all that what we are going to end up with is a ball of string like this you should be able to see how that is big Durant it 's always like a farm so getting my two pieces of fabric I 'm actually going to do it so opposite way here so that means when the colors meet I 'm going to get two times of the fabric I just think visually that looks a little bit better so to begin with we try not that 's just going to stop it from unraveling at one end now what you need to do is twist away from you so I 'm twisting away and then I 'm bringing that towards again twisting away from me and bring it towards me two or three tweeters it 's usually enough bring it towards me and I 'm pinching that part moving my thumb down as I twist twist away away and you 'll continue doing this technique if you say it out loud it 's a little bit easier you end up getting a little bit of a rhythm going and it 's almost like a drumbeat going in your hair twist away move towards twist away happen ease your colors such mix it is really nice during this with a stripy fabric but you might not have a striking summary you can use old scraps of fabrics tea towels great because they had big black marks on them they 've been outside for a while and they really needed to be replaced but I hate throwing things away it seems to be such a waste so you can see that I 'm twisting that away and you can see the colors coming together like that now when we get to the end of this what I 'll do is I 'll cut this off just to show you you don 't want to just have a nice short piece of string you 'd like to have a long piece like these so that you can continue making them into balls so what I 'm going to do is get my next piece and just hold it together and I 'm going to twist that and what happens is that with those two pieces okay and again I 'm twisting now I am holding with my thumb so it 's really important that you hold with your thumb that will stop it unraveling now what 's happening as you can see I 've almost got to the end of my joined you could tie a knot but then you get a big deal up and it can be a little bit bit difficult to twist the lump so there you can see now this one what I did is I stripped the fabric going down along the stripes so that we got lots of different colors so you get that different colored fabric coming through as you can see whereas these ones here I actually cut along the colors I said if you have a stripy fabric like that think about that when you 're cutting it up now if you have t-shirt II this is a stretchy fabric as I said you can mix this with a non stretchy fabric it is exactly the same process so again we 're going to start just by tying a little knot to hold it and then folding that between your two fingers we 're going to twist so twist away looking suckers get a little bit of a rolling action happening where you can you can almost swivel it between your fingers like that so what I 'm doing it 's but you can get it with the other one so I 'm just twisting so just twisting that rolling my fingers and it 's important sometimes just bring your hand down along the fabric to stop it naughty now I found that when I tore the fabric particularly this one the threads of cotton would come out and they would get all tangled so this way they 're not see same thing is happening we 're we 're getting back lovely color and then this straight now I 'll show you just how to do it with three what I 'm going to do is use a little bit of string I 'll use the ground stream just so that you can see how we get three different pieces just so they 're completely different and your eye will just see them so I 'll have to tie that piece of string normally you would tie all three of them together but I 'll just try imagine the end there so it 's like I said it is a bit trickier to eat three pieces but it is exactly the if you were to look closely at this string you would see that this is actually made up of two pieces of twine so what we 're doing is using our found materials and sourced fibers to make string like this this is quite thin we 're making it slightly cheaper one but if you cut your strips really then your string would be nervous so again I 'm twisting away holding that with my thumb and bring it bring it towards me so the top one is the one that I want to bring down and over the truth what gets a little bit tricky when you were doing three is trying to remember which one you have down in front of you so I 'm thinking I 've got the string I 've got the white I 've got the color that way if they get tangled I 'll remember string white string do you like to tangle have a go at doing that and see how yours does take a little bit of time to get the hang of it like knitting or crocheting and it becomes that if you 're a young business and you finding that difficult to manipulate your fingers [Music] he 's putting it under something and since to platic you could do the same thing so twist away and bring over the and bring over the top this is not quite heavy enough but a group or even someone holding the end of it would make quite a difference and then much like plashing where you 're just bringing over the top you twist and bring over the top it 's that twisting motion that gives us the string have a go at that come back and I 'll show you how we can do it with some plant fibers how did you go did you get your string twisted here is one that I 've made from some bits of plants that I found in the garden there 's lots of things you can try this with leaves of the tresina they 're like a spiky plant let 's try Titus again hold it with my fingers I 'm still twisting this but I mean a little bit because it 's also twisting these tweets really nicely again I 've got a twist and range Awards me twist the title you twist the thinner [Music] this actually works quite nicely because what the effect that you get is if the thickness of the Dracena contrasts really nicely against the vine this could also be quite effective with colors so this is a variegated receiver but you might want it is quite green so I 'm almost not really having to twist that vine you can see what starts to happen as that drama is because I 'm not having to twist that extra fine it is a much much bigger and what will happen is as their drivers each will that the water will come out of it and it will just get a little bit stiffer these are great to have on hand if you maybe don 't give an extreme I find it quite meditative to sit and do these when I 'm outside again do the same thing so we 're going to cross those two pieces over and twist them together keep twisting just to join the give it a twist away saying crossing over but I mean bringing towards me and you can just keep going with this what you could do afterwards true is you could put the ball itself once you 've made a big long piece or but if you 're wanting to make it into a ball if you could put that into the sink and soak it and that will make it more pliable so you can see now that 's coming together which is very similar to what we had here this one has dried but it 's a beautiful beautiful effect I love doing these I keep them in a box or as rolls like this and I use them for wrapping presents they can be reused time and time again and what you 're doing is preventing something from going to landfill I 'd love to see what you come up with I look forward to seeing some of your creations and I 'll see you again soon [Music] _"

yourself scooting forward to the front view Matt driving behind your thighs curling your pelvis under trying to rest on your sacrum all my words ago yes Oh really curving a spine you 're going to try and roll back one vertebrae at a time so the very lowest part of your bones back one of these slow just slowly pushing your hands into your your back well I hope your floor isn 't that a smoky is mine well clasping your hands behind your head letting your head be heavy in your hands please go to the roof let 's go you 're going to turn your legs out keep your toes pointed as your feet reach away now I don 't want my full flexibility I want it just off that because it keeps me working harder flex my feet heels come together breathing into lower breathing out to raise yours together breathing in and out you 're totally welcome to rest your head on the floor or a pillow if that suits you better thinking about pulling your belly button into your spine right now okay now I see you breathe in same thing but as you breathe out your knees are going to try and look towards each other and bring your knees towards one another notice that the rotation is actually happening straight from my hips and not from my feet and they 're not doing funky things on my feet my feet are still kind of reaching out like bending your legs toast you get a cute I don 't really worked out how love it okay knees reach away from one another now knees reach in so toes together knees apart as they go out knees together toes apart as they come back in you can see that just turnaround for breathing in and out in and out they were going to reverse it so toes lead away and toes lead back well breathing in breathing out so you 're internally rotating your hips to go out and externally rotating them to come back in breathing in and breathing out one more [Music] just let your feet to the floor for a moment put your hands on your pelvis see pubic bone Inge you to keep bones form a triangle we want that triangle to stay parallel to the floor so everyone is going to be a little bit different to one another except leaning on your pelvis shape but we 're gonna try and keep that as you bring your legs back up so knees are over the hips hands up to the sky my right hand me my head while my left hand reaches overhead come back to Center keeping that pelvis really still breathing it breathing out come back you can can do this if that 's nicer for you there 's no prizes for going the farthest or hurting yourself the most no prizes for that there are prizes however but treating yourself right there doing what feels right for you kind of myclass me hands behind your head map now as you right leg reaches behind your right elbow is going to reach this guy coming back and now you can totally curb your spine into the into the floor no problems with that breathing out breathing in back to Center breathing out to curve breathing in back to Center now I 'm reaching over my bottom so cool shoulder so I 'm trying to keep really open in my chest as I twist breathing out and still reaching my belly button towards my spine last one you know lockable keeping that spine really curved coming up to standing we haven 't done that leg work I thought we just added some more I 'm gonna push the air up as you go down breathing out breathing in push it back up so you can see if you don 't double bounce for anyone who is mindful of pelvic floor double bouncing is the bomb double bounce and so was the open and close exercise that we did earlier with you lying on the back and your necks going open and closing how do you two more going down standing down answer side one year raising Darren and up and down up and I 'm really pulling out with these other thighs so you 're not doing any funky stuff like that we weren 't good good stability good mobility and good structural integrity as a forward another side [Music] Michael shaking try and stay as relaxed as he can in your shoulders now we 're going to go double bounce and I 'm just one side and to go to a cut position double bounce cut [Music] now we 're gonna hold our cut 4 3 2 1 other side 3 2 3 do not see it 's not easy okay now what 's chest rolling death can engineers as much as he likes [Music] really clearly met spine magic I looking down I 'm I 'm pigeon toe yourself so you clean a nail parallel grabbing your ankle it anywhere on your leg that says helpful for you while you can maintain an arch shape place that pull your shoulder okay so you just go to and when they get it on really pulling away with your back they 're really curving your back as much as you can using your abdominals to support that [Music] something heads opposite handily just walking through the legs one day at a time in whatever momentum feels good for you I can say someone feels really good you can stay there for a few moments really breathe it in [Music] when you 're ready come to you better all that position you gotta roll up one vertebrae at a time shoulders back clasping your hands together when reaching you shoulders back chest to the sky classing the other way shoulders back chest the sky relevé imma just gonna do one final statements not circle this is smooth as you can reaching down at the armpit reaching up with the armpit side bent one arm sleeve over to the other side breathing our arm float now I 'm down being like bamboo go back to Center type it up I 'm sleep energy swing one each side growing tall through your head and rolling down bending your legs breathing in breathing out to the extent let me get you inverted V position one big way nice the floor chest open that 's with stretch going back into your Child 's Pose and staying here for a few moments just to absorb what you 've done enjoy yes

    "text": "ladies and gentleman we 're now going to have a panel session so I 'll invite Silvana Macri to come forward Sylvanas businesses state cyber safe is dedicated to educating empowering Australian businesses to protect themselves from cyber security threats ladies and Generals Silvana Macri our second panel or third panel member is Peter Caen of who is the chair of women in technology and WI who among other things is a champion for diversity and equality of women in the technical and related professions ladies and gentlemen Peter Knopf and helped me not feel quite so lonely up here Glen Murray managing director and chief executive of Sapien cyber whose unique cybersecurity solution has gained international attention ladies and gentlemen Glen Murray I 'm now going to move to and I think obvious I am working so welcome panel minister I 'd like to start with a question in relation to how the government intends to support industry in the development in innovation in the cybersecurity area and what you see of the potential benefits to the broader community can I say if they were prepared questions I haven and we do have a couple of representatives here from AHS industry I 'm a big supporter of oz industry because of the support that they can provide to individual businesses and to help them develop their capacity and and basically give them business advice link them into other areas where it being to export opportunities potentially through Austrade go through the various funding models that some that we have from an industry perspective what we are keen to do is look at the opportunities to grow businesses Australia so we do have a number of programs that are in place you touched before on the manufacturing modernization fund so applications have actually closed for that it was significantly oversubscribed but we are working through a process of support to develop capability that will be largely focused on building skilled capability and looking at how we can do technological upgrades to make sure that we can become more competitive in that area we are very keen to make sure that we are growing the links between industry and researchers we do that through the likes of the CRC programs cooperative from the establishment cooperative research centers that run for a maximum period of 10 years to focus on CRC Peas as they 're called which is Cooperative Research Centre projects which run generally for a maximum about three years but are very specifically targeted that 's where we 're starting to engage industry and researchers and do that very proactively in some of some key areas thank you this is a question for the whole panel perhaps each one of you could share with us an example of how you 've experienced or seen business transformation through innovation and I 'll start with you sivanna thanks Kerry and so in my current role it 's really leveraging innovation and what 's available to you to be effective and what that means in the bottom line but I also share so if I can acknowledge the minister as well and the government in the two programs that are really successful in stay smart online and the office of e-safety Commissioner as well because they very much support what we do and support business children and the elderly around cyber back to innovation I think the minister spoke about rpm so robotics process automation and that 's certainly that 's available to all of us in small business and an enterprise where you can actually automate and make tasks that are quite tedious take a lot of your resources time are quite mundane very easily to be an automated process that lets those staff do things that are a bit more challenging for them and they 're more likely to stay with you so there 's the element of cyber but also the element of using artificial intelligence through robotics process automation Thank You Glen yeah innovation is obviously in my industry is key we 're working to if you have a think about a very strange industry in cybersecurity you know it 's not an industry where you can predict what the customer is going to want in the future you know so we 're very reliant on what the adversary is going to be doing or do you know the sixteen-year-old kid who 's trying to impress Apple and downloads you know you know ninety give birth or sensitive files we do so innovation is key and so we you know it 's about creating that environment where you know the young minds and the minds of the world can come in and be curious in an innovate you know what 's the next detection technique what is the next machine learning capability that we need what is that next role in the future that we need that we don 't even know we we need it yet and it 's not just about the technology it 's not the ones and zeros is not everything in you know industry it 's you know I was speaking to somebody at RSA which is a national conference in the last couple of weeks and they said one of the best analysts that they had was someone who was a pianist not because you know the the ones and zeroes is because they 're good attack patterns mm-hmm so innovation is a wide variety it 's not just you know in my mind it 's not just you know a new novel thing it can be a process a procedure and could fabulous position and we 're seeing innovation across all sectors and I think that 's something we really need to keep in mind whether it 's agriculture that is really embracing innovation and technology and the next generation who come from farming families looking at their farm in different worlds he 's starting to solve problems differently bringing different skill sets to the table right through to I think what our traditional real strength is here is that we are very much a resources state we have some fabulous capability but now adding and bolting technology onto that makes us a world-leading hub in that automation and in that process of actually digitizing knowledge that we 've gathered over the last 200 years here thank you interesting in terms of your comments particularly when Glenn said about sometimes it 's a process and procedures we 've got a fairly sizable work for some time sheets everyone loves timesheets so we 've digitized ours and it 's transformed the workforce it also helped with the back-of-house activity as well so peer a question for you the importance of stem learning and you see the importance of that is how long do we have you set the scene brilliantly and you are example of stem role modeling so we 're seeing there 's a distinct lack in it 's a talent Ward this is not a question around gender this is not a question around diversity of female this is a question of how much talent can we bring to the table to make our community a better place for the next generation to live and quite frankly for us to grow old in I mean we all want to have a nice retirement I suspect there 's a huge gap and especially in the fiber space I mean in cyber itself women only represent 11 percent of the workforce and in the Asia Park area it 's 10 percent now when we then balance that with the conversation that the projections differ but on average one and a half to three million jobs are going to be created in this space in the next five to ten years where 's that talent coming from and how do we encourage our girls upskill and embrace real where they can actually use Filosa STEM skills thank you I think we 've got a pretty good role models this morning is the keynote yeah I 've found in life role models are very powerful way of moving things forward silvano perfectly good outline for us the changing perceptions of small business in the cybersecurity risk to their business and I I recall and I hope I 'm not quoting him too incorrectly but Craig Valle talks about it 's not if you 're going to get done it win yeah and that 's all around us Gary in terms of you know what 's happening we see it and we see it with ransomware attacks all the time so in the small to medium enterprise space you 're an easy attack vector it 's easy because you 're not generally spending as much money on your infrastructure and your defense mechanisms but I will talk to you can safeguard yourself as much as you can technically and we talked about the zeros and the ones but it 's the gray in Cades the people do present it because to take vector in terms of phishing which will be an entry point for route somewhere and then it 's a slippery a slippery slope downhill so from my perspective with smees don 't underestimate the value that your staff have to you and train them up in terms of their expertise around social engineering so fishing and things like that where which we take for granted because we see it in all aspects of our life not just at work but at home so that would be the where I would be saying that 's a focus for me thanks for that then perhaps you get outlined some of the cyber security opportunities that you see particularly in the area of collaboration and I I guess I learned a lot the other day when we had the the roundtable at the city where we talked about having a regular catch-up and I thought maybe they will maybe they won 't visit a resounding yes please and how soon one B yeah it 's interesting you know so my background is actually electronic warfare so and know everything has a defense clearance and so forth coming out an industry into cybersecurity industry quite had the same feel and so everything 's got a security feel about it as a classification and a lot of the areas that we look at does it really need to have a classification because what it does is it means that data information is not shared and so if you 're in a company that has had a cyber attack you kind of feel like I 've got to keep that to myself and so that that 's sharing that information so another company doesn 't suffer the same attack is not there so collaboration is king in this industry you know we 're up against adversary 's where they 're they 're very well organized they 're very well trained and we 're very reactive so we 're behind the eight ball all the time so by having continuous events having roundtables collaborating with other experts in industry is key to start to create an ecosystem where we can start to get ahead of the game and I can 't cyber attack you know there is ways that you can tell the world without giving away all the ins and outs and how it happened and you know any IP that may be there and so other parts of the industry or other industries can learn from that so collaboration is key thanks man Minister perhaps you might share with us what you see is some of the challenges and opportunities of your portfolio under the current situation and particularly in light of the announcements made yesterday about boosting industry look there 's there 's a lot of opportunities for business in Australia and I believe that the package that was was announced as being announced clearly will have some incentives for businesses support for businesses what we need to be very focused on as I said when I spoke before is making sure that we are playing to our strengths yeah so when I worked with my manufacturers my large manufacturers my peak organizations it 's very important for them and for the government that there is widespread support for all industry right across Australia and as a government some key strengths and that 's where we 'll probably be looking at using funding levers to grow in those areas but like with any sort of research for example particularly the blue sky research you don 't actually know what you 're going to find along the way and what 's important for all of us and particularly for government is that we are open to those opportunities as well so we will continue to do to provide support for all Australian industries we understand that there 's a very big difference in the support that 's needed for small medium and large businesses and if you look at the circumstances in which Australia finds itself now we have businesses that have been affected by drought then by flood by bushfires and now potentially the coronavirus so if you 're a large business particularly if you 're a multinational you are better placed to sustain those shocks and you have different access to supply chains than a small business which often keeps a fairly low inventory practices just in time to a critical point and then you 've got broadly categorize them as as levels requires different support now we know that small businesses major employers and that a lot of innovation comes particularly from our small businesses so what we have looked at is government is how we are going to support small businesses so that they can become medium-sized enterprises and potentially grow from there if they choose to do so so this is not you can on the conveyor belt as a start-up and then you become effectively a small business and you keep growing you can jump off that conveyor belt anytime you like and stay exactly where you are and we need that to happen we need our startups to become effectively small businesses and consolidate and we will be focusing on a government at continued support for a small business but also the medium enterprises which are suffering some difficulties right at the at the moment Minister do you think maybe that we 're changing visitors and industry about just in time I 've watched how movies to hold stock I don 't know we 've become so good with the logistics that there 's no stock at the other end there 's no logistics required and then there 's no stock do you think we might revisit that look I think there 's going to be a rethink in there already years by government and by many businesses about their supply chains their dependence on one nation in particular to supply the goods the raw materials that they that they need so I think that we think is already happening I mean one of the the instances but that I think is is quite concerning that I 'll share with you is that I am hearing stories of businesses that are saying that they have been able to find Australian manufacturers to support their supply chain needs at the current environment but as soon as China 's back on its feet they will go back to purchasing from China because it 's cheaper now I understand that I don 't agree with it and I don 't think it 's a smart way for businesses to operate and I think that having come through the bushfire the droughts the floods and now of this we 've actually got to have a seriously look at what our Australian manufacturing capability needs to be but that requires support from businesses because let 's be honest and let 's call this the reason that some of our manufacturing has gone offshore is because it did not get support from Australian and Australian businesses as well so I think that as businesses start to reflect on what has happened and they start looking at at what their models are going to be in the future I would hope that they look at diversification and I hope that Australian industry supports each other looks at where the needs are and and seizes those opportunities you might see a revitalization of the buy Australian program that we used to have years ago ladies and gentlemen would you please thank our panel Minister Andrews Peter Knopf Queen Marie [Applause] _"

    "text": "good everybody its Mike place it back again to talk to you about exploring your neighborhood with your camera during these unusual times when we live there still a few best fixes going so we certainly can 't travel overseas can we so or interstate so why not explore your backyard between your tourist and have a look around as if you are traveling somewhere now now we 're gonna talk about built landscape basically most of us live in cities pounds let 's face it that 's where most of us population though is based so how about looking at what is around us in the built landscape we looked at other areas but now it 's time to have a little closer look of where we live now it 'd be about me or though might be much because you probably what you know about me now if you 've seen the last couple of presentations photographer writer with my wife been around for quite a while now been doing freelance photography and I was a Press photographer in the early days and now I 'm doing this anyway let 's get moving because we only got 15 minutes trouble mindset at home this is something I 've come up with or we came up with is that when we go away we have a different mindset when we 're traveling overseas in the state or even in our own state we 're a little bit more adventurous a little bit more out there with more curious we like to try new things and and behave quite differently than when we 're at home and when we are at home we tend to be the opposite as I 'm saying so why not bring that travel mindset to where you live and live like you 're traveling your own backyard basically and we 're talking about and that 's what we 're talking about here now we all know our city most of us live in Perth or all these suburbs around Perth and we pretty well know our area quite well we know the build buildings basically we know where to drive to for coffee we know basically the things we do all the time and we transport or drive and these are all very familiar however this is an opportunity now with people especially ahead may have a bit more time not everybody has but a lot of people have a bit more time to actually get out and try new things and what I 'm talking about here is we 've reform II of where we are but why not look at these things with new eyes why not have a look around and explore areas which you may not know before during when we are in normal work phase and before cope at nineteen we would probably know the favorite of tunnel vision and just getting on with word and not really knows what 's around us but you know great city there 's lots of things to see that you may have missed otherwise so this is about looking for something a little bit different around where we live so for me now for starters well go through this usually I 've been talking about this and the other presentations but I 'll have to go through it again because it 's important probably stressed and we probably anxious and is uncertainty so how do we so when the prerequisites I think is to relax and get into the zone of being in the moment basically and to use less me our stress so this is partly what we 're doing here so first I get that mobile phone of yours on fight mode so you 're not distracted without they 're looking for things to photograph if you 're using your phone just use it as a camera not it for anything else slow down breathe we I mean this photographic mill but it 's not perfect but gives the example what I 'm talking about traffic the the stresses of modern living or the sky thing it bears down on us so this is not between you to slow down and take some deep breaths so when you get out there it 's all about relaxing deep breathing is really important just a few deep breaths and stop rushing around there 's no need to rush around take your time and at the same time of waking your senses in our we tend to be another tunnel vision we 're not seeing everything that is there better see and our other senses are dead and too it 's about awakening all your senses not just in visual sense as in photography it 's about smelling the smells it 's about feeling the feelings it 's about hearing the hearing what 's going on hearing the sounds of the city not always pleasant oh my dad but there are sounds that are out there which which quite pleasant it 's facing so that 's what you 're doing you 're trying to awaken your senses through everything so you look when you let your senses you tend to be in the moment and your stresses tend to go away it 's amazing things can happen when you do that and so that 's familiar place if you get out and find explore your backyard basically and it 's just it 's just a matter of driving somewhere or walking somewhere and you built landscape might be your local suburb it could be a trip into town have a little walk around feeling so the familiar place has become actually places to discover things but the other key thing that 's one way of doing the other way of doing is discover new places go to places that we haven 't been to before drive three places we haven 't been before you look on Google Maps or anything like that and maybe go a different route or walk down a different Street in your neighborhood check out the housing check out the gardens it 's basically gonna see things you 've never seen before so discovering new places can be very close or it can be further away element aces and travel being relaxed a bit so a girl a bit further afield now so try new places be a bit daring just discover these places that maybe not just photogenic but also may create a kind of sense of exploration I guess that you do when you normally travel I 'll briefly talk about some things about some composition and things and an important an important purpose oddly lights early morning light like this photograph is magical so getting out in starts so you know area where schools you can get out and early and have placed yourself except for any more exercises or might be around at the same time and easy as this traffic so give me a around sunrise there it is a fantastic time to do this and you get to see everything in a new light and quickly talk about one part of it so that 's the setting where your sensor your camera picks up light and it can vary so you can use high ISO number which allows more light into the sensor number so numbers vary to walk around streets in the evening or later take photographs without using the flash that special useless in this situation and use a higher shutter speed that therefore you can hand hold your camera that progress and get free creative with the I say chickens booklets instruction booklet and see how it all works like so and have a play have a playing your own place and have fun with that and do things differently I mean this is God 's Wendy 's coming into winter a big downpour in Claremont through the windscreen on the car abstract feeling about it say this is a good opportunity try different things have fun with it forms and shapes cities are designed in a way that I 've have forms different forms of shapes so get creative with that try different things look down on from the building looking down to the street level and check out the patterns and forms you can see again this is a really great option to get really creative again same thing here the 14 shapes and the and nothing around see stuffs got things like reflections in windows of a sunset example framing get fun with framing framing is a kind of technique which conversation technique which enhances many photographs if you play around with it and get creative with it the frame is a good way especially the cities where lots of archways and and that kind of thing where you can actually do framing shots change your angles I 've talked about a lot don 't just take one shot one spot change your angles get creative getting the architectural forms can be quite interesting so look closely look at the different forms getting close take photos of different patterns and that sort of thing and it 's very very rewarding so you 're recapturing the essence of where you live textures textures nature textures that are everywhere but also built textures for example walking in anyway in Perth there 's all sorts of potential to find textures and buildings and always worthy of comedy and enhance your experience photography obviously in streets of cheese take photographs this one in Perth but sir hi I saw a number that 's amazing what sort of photographs you can get of everyday life in a city in undercoated 19 times and my phone stops the position my court they knew against the Old Town Hall against a new building and the big kind of contrast at best a lot of fun and quirky reflections and a hubcap of old finished car you know your little things are really quick in different and creative that creates that kind of creative type of photography that we 're after and go black and white try black and white for change look for strong shapes and strong images geometric images that kind of thing which come up very well in black and white thinking black and white that 's a great challenge and finally have fun finally street art have found of the quirkiness of what 's around us is lots of things that can make us laugh or smile so it 's all about having fun in these times so get out there take lots of photographs explore your city and I 'm sure you 'll get life sex affects it affects any of that and I 'll get back to you in the near future for no one thank you _"

    "text": "[Music] and welcome back to cities June drives optimal isolation dance edition this video is going to be talking about things you may not know or may not thought about you 've never been to a dance class I 'm gonna put a big disclaimer not all classes are the same not on teachers of the same not all dance styles are the same so this is a very general remember disappointment is only when your expectations aren 't met so the first rule when it comes to going to a dance class it 's going with an open mind first thing they need to do research not all classes itself like I said you could be more of a jazz dancer you could be more a ballad you can be a salsa dip you can be attacked it 's just like going to school or academics dance classes teach to put styles so don 't expect to have everything want blocks a lot of people ask the question I 've never been to a dance possible for what are we agree if you 've never been to a dance you bring a water bottle gonna get thirsty in the dance class I like to bring a change of clothes is you don 't know how sweaty you 're gonna get this class now if you 've never been to a dance class before it might be good to bring with you options in terms of choose to wear different teachers and different places where you dance have different rules sometimes it 's good to bring sneakers sometimes it 's good to have absolutely jazz shoes slip on shoe or a ballet shoe sometimes it 's good to have bare feet and then there is more specific like in flamenco and tap you might need specific shoes but if this is your first time going to a class you have to go out and buy the most expensive data to go and try the class first you want to make sure that you 're also wearing clothing which is comfortable it 's dance and I 'm comfortable I mean not too baggy think again boss and not to tie and restrict it you wanna make sure that you 're wearing you 've never worked out just wear something affection feel second thing you need to make sure that if a dance class is starting at a certain time you arrive before just because a class starts at five o 'clock does not mean that you should arrive at five o 'clock in terms of dance time if you 're on time wait you 're gonna make sure that you arrive a few minutes early my personal advice is a minimum of five minutes early or anything like me I like to do my own savvy sort of warm up stretch before I walk into a class especially if I 've never done that class or just a really simple stretch to wake up my book you want to know how to do a simple stretch should go check out my previous video about warming up some things that you can do while you wait is being social I like to always say hello to the other people are brewing it 's an option to interact with some people that you may not have met before you can also ask questions style you can always honest people around what 's their favorite thing about why they like upper tooth class why do they like coming to the studio and if you 're not the type of person and you 're gonna ask that question to a stranger Tori you 're gonna simply wait remember you 're coming to this class not for anything when you walk inside the class you want to make sure that you pass questions introduce yourself to the tech tonight I 've never danced before boo a teacher really likes to know how much of spurious a new member in a class house so don 't be afraid to admit that you 've never been to a faster or you 've never done this star but what they 'll do is they 'll make sure to look out for you give you the support and advice your nature of class a lot of teachers like to create their Walmart somehow a regular tie performer so it 's your first time I mean you don 't have to stand back what you can do is stand somewhere in in front of you they follow and you 're close enough to see yourself in the mirror you want to make sure that you can see yourself in the mirror just like any sort of learning you want to make sure you can see yourself so you can pass the flap now when it comes to the warm-up in the class you want to make sure that you are pushing yourself as hard as if you want to push yourself this is your first time and you may not know the expectations of this class best thing that you can do when you 're in the class is just follow a lot and I 'm going to give you some tips and shrieks when it comes to following along choreography and instructions you should never compare yourself to another dancer in aspects if you 've not had to save opportunities for training as that person acts remember the acts there for everyone and that means everyone is different and everyone has different levels of experience so don 't compare yourself that but you can definitely compare yourself in terms of attend that you may come across in a class which you might not have now marking is what happens when you don 't do the choreography learning in pots for laps as if you were performing in front of an audience personally like to go full-out as often as possible as a testimony jerks but be smart you don 't want to be tired within 10 or 15 making crops with a survivalist best thing that you can do it 's just dry probably the most important rule is it 's not the worse than being a teacher saying hey come on you can be a little bit disrespectful however if you 're coming to the end of a class and learnt a particular piece of paragraph i love to film in here in self-reflection here 's the best thing to do ah most of the time teachers will actually want you to film and reflect and maybe share it on social media so you can get some feedback from other people remember to always ask permission I 'm sure they would love to have other people come and have and now the fun part I 'm going to teach you routine I want you to focus on one three different ways that you can work over now there 's no perfect way to learn choreography because like all people it all different ways of learning are unique to those things so these are just some tips and tricks that I have when it comes to learning [Music] the reason that we do this is most music is recorded with the beat of Paul begs to buck and we like to count those beats as a way to set choreography now you can have an even one two three sometimes choreographers can do these sometimes can help so what I want you to do is watch this routine and try and count along with one two three so when it 's 3 8 3 3 4 5 6 7 8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 1 2 3 2 easy another way by the body throughout try watching the choreography focus just on the shapes [Music] up down trying you stop on the left foot and shift your weight to the right oh that 's a really good way of thinking about pathway what I want you to do is I want you to watch the choreography for a third time and this time just look at the pathway left right up to the right to the left to your right turn to the left sweep to the right up kick left to the front scoop through right back on the left down up down head so how do you do did you think that working with pathway shapes or the rhythm was most affected for you here 's the thing though there 's no set way that you should learn co-op sometimes it can be a mixture of all three depending on the style depending on [Music] I recommend you check out some of the other videos on this channel like we 're Stephanie who 's teaching people how to see oh maybe you 'd like to work with Nicola these teaching people how to act whatever you do I would hope you enjoy these parts and isolation poems it 's bringing you closer together and the wider community across this map and hey where we can all be together hope you go and check out including dance classes there are so many on in this community so excited just keep dancing [Music] wait now before you go anywhere Stephanie Nicola and myself are taking online submissions for our upcoming masterclass you might be wondering what a masterclass is see what our master class we 're going to be taking individuals from the community and work with them to develop their skills in the arts while still remaining in isolation so if you would like a little bit of extra help from me when it comes to your dancing or in developing your performance or working on your personal style or anything dance related whether you have never danced before or you 're been dancing your entire life doesn 't matter we want to help you I especially want to ask any of our future triple threader 's out there that 's a singer a dancer and an actor all in one to let us know how we a little bit of movement and also ask them for a little bit of help for something specific to the US and isolation project we 're really looking forward to getting to work with a couple of people in their coming weeks whatever you need send us video link and we 'll help you out remember everyone just keep dancing you _"

    "text": "you [Music] I welcome back to the second acting workshop with the arts and isolation from the city of Joondalup my name is Nicola Renton and I 'm thrilled to see you again so today we are going to be working on the monologue finding the perfect monologue for you is very difficult I can tell you after 20 years of experience I 've tried all sorts of different ways of finding them but the very best way is just to read out loud as many monologues as you can get your hands on a best place to get a monologue is of course on the internet so I want you to put in monologue female monologue male and sometimes you can even get more specific and kind of put your age bracket that you can play in there of course in theatre there 's so many different ages that you can play with stage makeup and your beautiful acting performance in film it gets a lot tighter so you could probably play in so well you 've looked at yourself five years on either side I am 46 and name is Nicola Renton I 'm 46 years old and then you 'll take a moment and then you would start with your audition monologue what you 're looking for is something that can show a range so if you choose a monologue that all the way through you 're very angry and you just feel very betrayed and yeah there 's a lot of angst going on all the way through it 's a lot and the best way to do it is you want to show them that you can do a range so if you could find a monologue or even write your own and we 'll definitely encourage you to do there find a monologue where you can take on a character who will play at least three emotions perhaps you 're hurt at first but I don 't understand I don 't know am Irish all of a sudden I don 't understand you said you were coming back to me and and you 've changed your mind but I love you well then go go too far and and don 't come back no I 'm finished I didn 't mean that I love you I I can never be anyone else for me or something along those lines that 's quite dramatic so what you 're wanting to do is find a range that you can play now in saying that we 're going to be working on a monologue together today and I 'm going to put it up on the screen for you press pause and do that for me and then come back here is your audition monologue that we 're going to be working on today [Music] [Music] [Music] it was interesting when I was looking for a monologue for us to work on together I obviously tried to find one that I knew myself already but they were thoroughly inappropriate so I Blanche from streetcar named desire I won an award for playing her and I still remove her speeches really well that was a great one to read but a little inappropriate when we have the Ange rage that I am doing these workshops for and I also did just a couple of years ago a really were words in there that made me blush so so I found this one this I feel like this is a great middle-of-the-road one I haven 't seen the production before so it 's like we 're going for this audition together so it is a new monologue to me and here we go I 'm going to let you know some of my process I would have done the research which we 've had a look at already and now I 'm looking at this big piece of text that I have to learn in my busy schedule here is some clues what to do I use an app called line learner and it is great it saved my life on so many occasions with helping me get those lines into my head you can listen to it on repeat I switch it with a monologue that 's just great so just go go over and over and over and you just want to get those words into your head as quickly as possible the play is set in Philadelphia I have not ever done a Philadelphia accent before incredibly specialized accent coaches around the world but for the rest of us who can 't get hold of them we are learning on YouTube it is fantastic what they can do and YouTube and really you 're working from people who are awesome I did look it up there is somebody who can teach you for the Delphian accent if you want to give it a go we 'll start with us but maybe we can you know be a little bit and we 'll give it a go so this is what I did I 'm sorry I 'm looking at this space and thinking I 'm sorry I 'm looking at the space and thinking looking at the space I 'm sorry I 'm looking at the space and I 'm thinking how much of my time is spent in rehearsal rooms a lot so let 's say it again I 'm sorry I 'm looking at this space and thinking sorry I 'm looking at the space and thinking sorry I 'm looking at the space and thinking all right so once I 've really read I 'm looking at the space and thinking how much of my time is spent in the rehearsal room days months years changing liens changing scenes changing words try to make people sound more like people beat in brackets means that you take a breath and it 's a bit of a change I think it was in a rehearsal room in the late West 50s that I that a casting director told me that no one wanted to do my play and there was only one actress who might do it so he hired her and she got the Tony Award it was in a rehearsal room on lower on lower Broadway that George Kaufman 's daughter said my father would have loved you that must be a huge accolade George Kaufman 's daughter saying my father would have loved you it was in the West forties rehearsal that I met the guy I would marry and it was a dance call at 899 optic all from Guatemala saying that I had been assigned a child to adopt congratulations your father father father father a father the woman said a significant moment in my life I couldn 't hear her great so you 're gonna read over it a couple of times it 's actually a really funny it 's a I mean the whole show is a comedy but yeah that 's funny I was hilarious Winona um here we go so the punctuation is weird in this so I would definitely say make it your own make it your own pretty pauses where you want it to be days months years so this full stops after all day yes sir days months years days months years days months years who knows changing lines changing scenes changing words trying to make people sound more like people yeah great so really big things in there that I did my first impression of it you know to cast no one like to do this this unknown persons play and he finally got given an actress and he 's such a good job with this play as the director or the writer he did such a good job that she won the Tony Award a huge industry recognition award for the huge accolade George Kaufman 's daughter would have said Kaufman daughters Hoffman yeah I 'm gonna have to google that Kaufman 's daughter said my father would have loved to you so that 's obviously someone George Hoffman 's daughter said my father would have loved you you know you know I 'd put that on my CV what am I saying you know what I 'm saying and it was a dance cool so that means Prasad can audition a dance school at 890 Broadway when I got the call from Guatemala so he met a man that he would marry had a rehearsal and he went on to marry him then adopted a child and congratulations your father and what a thing you know congratulations you 're going to be a dad but I could hear Lee I could barely hear her over the tap-dancing she said the most important words I 've ever heard yeah it 's a great one it 's so interesting because my first street of that I didn 't I totally missed because he 's a father yeah and then he 's he context of that now which I missed before so if you were a woman as I am and I 've chosen this piece I would just change it I would change it to be I meant the man I marry and then I 've got a phone call so I 'm gonna be I 'm gonna be mother now I can 't bear children so I really like the speech and I 'm gonna make it my own as well and add it to my repertoire of inappropriate monologues that I have under my belt well and this one 's so appropriate now wonderful so I 'm gonna teach you a little bit about what I do to find the color in the script in the text so I 'm sorry I 'm looking at the space and thinking I 'm sorry I 'm looking at the space and thinking I 'm sorry I 'm looking at the space and thinking I 'm sorry I 'm looking at the space and thinking sorry I 'm looking at the space and thinking sorry I 'm looking at the space and thinking emphasis in a different word all the way through the next thing so you do that all the way through and go over each line emphasis emphasis enter still your talk will stop and then all the way down the screws and then you 're going to come back and I 'm going to say read the whole script with the motivation hmm to seduce I 'm sorry I 'm looking at the space and I 'm thinking how much of my time been spent in rehearsal rooms days now and that you do it all the way through with that intention and then you come back and your side again I 'm gonna say to intimidate I 'm sorry I 'm looking at the space and I 'm thinking how much time is spent in rehearsal rooms and then it could be to investigate all the way through I 'm sorry I 'm looking at the space and I 'm thinking how much of my time is spent in rehearsal rooms days months yes changing life so I mean you 're not trying to do your best acting but if I said say to intimidate and there was I love you on there is I love you get in the person 's face with it so what your mind slowly starts to do you 're tricking it into learning lines as you 're going but also what you 're doing is you 're adding color you 're like ah never thought that those two words could have a touch of two to intimidate in it I did not dad that didn 't work me so if you get all your two words or your action words and try and put it in there and you can do that so many so many times and that 's what I would do I 'm to add color to those words so you 'll get words and every sentence have a little bit of undertone to them and that 's what your mind being so clever is can start capturing and then what I do was fish with my students as I do it with accents great to practice and work as you know I quite like that same work so you you 're gonna do it like this I 'm sorry I 'm looking at the space and I 'm thinking how much time is spent in the rehearsal rooms days months years changing lines changing scenes changing words trying to make people sound more like people right and then you 're gonna go back and I gotta say the French accent but what this does is the stereotype of doing an accent and taking on a little bit of the character does the same thing as the motivation does so tricking your mind with kind of fun into getting very familiar with those words but also agreeing little different nuances and color into that text I 'm sorry I 'm looking at this face and I 'm thinking how much of my time is spending of us there 's months years changing lands changing scenes changing world what 's trying to make people sound more like people I think it was at the rehearsal room in the West 50s that the casting director told me that no one wanted to do my play and there 's only this one accuracy Tony Awards ah all right but what you can see is it 's bringing all these different personalities and characters and letting them have a play remember at the end of this five-part series you are in fact going to be able to film something an audition monologue or a scene and send it to the city of Joondalup when I get to watch it I 'm really hoping that you are enjoying this series I 'm enjoying being here with you have a wonderful week be brave be professional be kind my grandma and your grandma sitting by the fire my grandma said to your grandma I 'm gonna set your world on fire talk about hey now hey now I could go on they break it down oh come on peanut I 'm nan de hey come on feed on it hey hey come on banana hey hey come on banana hey _"

    "text": "hi everyone i 'm darren and i 'm jihun and welcome to the city of jin top libraries chop-chop stories we will be telling adventurous stupendous and fantabulous stories and we 're going to share in this storytelling Darrin will say one line I will see another and who knows where the story might end up and to make it even more exciting or using three weekly words that we have to put into the story that 's right and this week oh no Darrin do you feel that why do jihun I think something bigs coming this way it 's a it 's a dinosaur not just any dinosaur Darrin this is a Tyrannosaurus Rex his name means king of the tyrant lizards what 's it doing here I think he might be a clue to this week 's three weekly words speaking of three weekly words Darrin don 't you have a story that someone sent in I do just keep being away from me okay then you can stay with me mr. T Rex oh okay last week three weekly words were twinkle spaceship and Caterpillar and three weekly words to write her own story Angie 's story is called dream big there lived an ordinary caterpillar who had a big dream her name was Katy and every night after all the other caterpillars had gone to sleep she 'll climb to the highest leaf and stare out at the twinkling stars wishing that she could get closer you see Kay 's dream was to be an astronaut but the other caterpillars always put it down and told her that she was crazy and that caterpillars weren 't meant to go into space yet when Katie looked into the night sky she couldn 't let go of her dream one night add a shadow appeared near her leaf and she froze as a human and stretched out towards her the next morning Katy woke up here hey buzz why do you bring that caterpillar into spaceship it 'll be my pet on our space adventure he replied and whispered to her we 're going to the moon and Katy realized she was about to live her dream the end Wow Angie that was a great story wasn Angie 's sister Christina has also drawn a picture of the story that is amazing too you are both very talented sisters if anyone else wants to write a story using the three weekly words please send them through to us and we can read them next time okay gee hon I think it 's time for this week 's three weekly words to be drawn from the metrical story hat let 's do it Darrin I 'll get mr. t-rex to help but first we need a magical story hat and here it is mr. T Rex is going to help me pick out the words from the hat what what 's that you said mr. t-rex your arms are too short to pick up the words from the Hat that 's okay I 'll help you with it and this week 's words are stop volcano and kitchen okay so we have to tell a story using the three weekly words of stomp volcano and kitchen let 's get started once upon a time there was a family of dinosaurs Steve sources to be exact it was Doug big brother Stegosaurus oh ji-hun there 's one member of the family he forgot to mention Theodore the little brother Stegosaurus okay there was also Theodore see you know wasn 't like any of the other stegosauruses he didn 't like lounging in this tropical Sun and playing prehistoric games Theodore loved cooking he would cook the most fabulous feasts for breakfast lunch and dinner but it was especially good at Queen deserts gracious crumble with sticky syrupy sauce and Gia pancakes with whipped cream and strawberries yellow-green Jurassic jellies and though Theodore 's family loved to eat his delicious creations they didn 't understand his obsession with cooking the family of Stegosaurus has lived at the base of an active volcano mount spittoon and the ovens in Theodore 's kitchen were powered by red-hot lava but one day bounce spittoon began to rumble and Shake and suddenly crack there was a big crack in the middle of the kitchen floor and out poured red short you don 't grab anything close to hand and threw it down into the crack in wind the flow and stop stop stop Theodore swell ch and Theodore them into the crack in when the sugar crush crush crush Theodore crushed it into the crack and even went chocolate chips and yum yum yum Theodore I need a few of them and put the rest in and finally the crack filled up and Theodore kitchen was not flowing with but man spittoon was still shaking and Theodore ran outside to join his family watching the volcano my own spit dude shook shook shook and Rumble Rumble Rumble and interrupted in an explosion of choc chip muffins and as Beatles families stood outside in the rain of chocolate chip muffins they all agreed it was the most delicious volcano eruption ever the end that was a very nice dinosaur in that story maybe mr. t-rex isn 't that scary after all that 's right Darren and mr. t-rex is very nice he can grow up to 13 meters long wave 14 times and have teeth that measured 30 centimeters so that he can chop chop chop okay okay okay I think maybe I just like Stegosaurus okay I think that 's all we got time you goes out to ngns sister Christina for sending in their amazing story and drawing and another big thank you to mr. t-rex who will be staying with us and you 'll eat people who don 't like my stories so he can grow bigger and bigger and bigger actually jihun I think we might have another special guest to draw the words from our magical story hat and we 'll have a lot more neon amazing stories to read bye everyone _"

    "text": "hello and welcome to your second singing lesson as part of the triple threat project I hope you had a chance to practice the exercises that we did last week I decided to start this video sitting down as I did Laughlin 's dance video and now I 'm just a little bit sore but how good is that doing something new and adapting today 's lesson is going to be an extension from the breathing ideas I gave you last week and I 'm going to waltz into the humdinger of singing ideas breath support what does it even mean now I 'm not here to argue any particular methodology many teachers have their own ideas about what breath support is I 'm just going to give you what I think it is and the exercises that I use that I find really helpful and that my students love as well so before we go into this idea of breath support I think it 's really helpful to just think about how a breath even happens so we can look at it at two phases so our first one so your lungs are these beautiful sponge like balloons and they are housed by your ribs B ribcage and in between your ribs are intercostal muscles so in between those ribs all around housing your lungs underneath your lungs lies your diaphragm and it 's a gorgeous frisbee looking muscle that sits in a dome shape up underneath the lungs now during inhalation if we go back to year 10 science class if you paid attention which I didn 't I 'm sorry mister in when gases move they move they want to move from an area that is of high pressure into low pressure so during an inhalation your diaphragm contracts and moves downwards creating a vacuum your intercostals contract and move upwards and outwards and as a result the space inside the ribcage or the lungs gets greater and therefore the breath pressure is lower outside of the body the breath pressure is higher and therefore goes in to try and equalize that imbalance of breath pressure during exhalation the diaphragm is relaxing and coming back up into that dome shape the intercostals are relaxing and coming back inside has gotten smaller the breath pressure is greater it wants to go to a place where the breath pressure is lower which is outside of the body and therefore breath goes out and there we have a breathing cycle how cool is that now of course it 's way more complex than that but that 's a good starting point for the brain to just digest how it even works now when we 're speaking on average we take about 12 to 20 breaths per minute and that 's because the requirements from for speaking are not that great of course if you 're on stage or you 're young at someone then the requirements on that breath are going to be greater but we have a tendency to have the breaths quite shallow and we are having that cycle of about 12 to 20 per minute when we 're singing the demands on the breath and for breath are so much greater we 're often singing in longer phrases then we would need to speak a sentence we are using pictures that are much higher than the ones at playing around with volume and trying to project the sound in a full manner or possibly going on a much softer idea and so the demands on that breath and that breath energy and greater so singing has a greater need for breath energy and an elongated breath cycle so how long I can go between taking a breath so we need really great flexibility and control over that rath flow so when we want to look at this idea of support we can come to this old-school term called a pod jaw which is an Italian term meaning to lean or to support now this idea is that those muscles that were involved during that inhalation so the diaphragm Contracting and those intercostals that came and flared out we are trying to delay those going back into their original position so you can think of breath support as trying to use the muscles of inhalation and resisting everything going back too quickly it 's almost like Indiana Jones in the Temple of Doom I don 't even know if it 's Temple of Doom I don 't know and they 're coming in against him and he 's just trying to resist but we have this beautiful flexibility where neither one of them is winning the wall is kind of winning but so is Indiana Jones you want to think of this breath flexibility the same way that as you 're trying to have this concept of still trying to stay in an inhalation position as you sing it 's flexible it 's not locked and you 're not trying to put the body in an unnatural state I love to think of a jellyfish so it 's very fluid and can move and we 're just trying to figure out what is the flow of that movement so that being said I 'm now going to take you into some exercises to help you with this idea of breath support these exercises I want you to think of yourself as an awesome rally car and we 're just revving through the zet so we 're really going to try and use the Z to help open up the ribcage feel like the back is opening front is let 's see if we can start our engines and find our zet so I 'm gonna get you to put your hands on the lower part of your ribcage and I just want you to give me a gorgeous full Z like yeah revving your engine getting ready to start a race so we 're gonna go you ready to try it and how did you go did you find that your engine was coming in did I have a feeling of Zuzu 's and collapsing on itself let 's see if you can find a bit more of that idea of what you felt during an inhalation so I thinking about that Zed trying to operate like that inhale once again Zuzu there are some healthy sounding engines so I want you to have that feeling when you 're going to be using these exercises on the set I 'd like you to go get yourself a chair make sure it 's a sturdy one so that when you put a little bit of your weight on it it doesn 't instantly topple over leaving you to fall standing behind this chair and you 're just going to be gently leaning on it as you do the exercise now that leaning sensation you 're then going to try and picture that that is happening in other areas of your body so what you can feel going in that forward direction you want to feel that that 's happening through your sides through your back both the lower and upper back through your chest everywhere you want to feel like you are leaning and getting bigger in the space during the exercise so it 's going to sound a little like this so you want to try that one with me and [Music] fabulous I 'm gonna help you give the pitch and you 're gonna try the exercise now for yourself and [Music] capers legs loose [Music] you matter all that beautiful laning power that you have you [Music] fantastic [Applause] few more in this direction energy energy opening up [Music] to him all this way [Music] [Applause] [Music] coming back down keep everything up think of the lane [Music] superstar let 's finish strong [Music] come along to take you through a full major scale plus at the 9th of that major scale so essentially we 're going to be dealing with the numbers 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 then coming back 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 it 's going to sound something like this you ready to get those engines revving let 's give it a shot [Music] fantastic lane through the body [Music] excellent and extend up the top [Music] Swimmer stars [Music] one more this way [Music] coming back down blini use that beautiful body and [Music] excellent good work two more [Music] last one [Music] in this exercise I 'm going to extend what we just did in that last one we 're going to add a few more note repetitions at the top and then come back down the scale so to give you some idea once you get to the eighth and the ninth of the scale we 're going to repeat between those two five times and then come back down so it 'll be something like this one two three four five got this idea of Leaning through our body in all directions but this time once we 've done it on the Zed we 're going to go back starting on that same pitch that we just did and we 're going to open to a vowel for now I 'll start on an E but feel free to use this exercise with all of the different vowels here we go so it 's going to sound something like this [Music] breath and bell [Music] [Applause] you ready to try it let 's do this and st. pitch [Music] moving up with cemetery actors it [Music] opening to avow [Music] is it you Val you you got it let 's go [Music] again [Laughter] [Music] awesome [Music] [Music] factors it [Music] [Applause] to avail [Music] [Applause] Wow well done racing cars _"

make it today special crafts so you should have been provided a nice Tim right which looks a little bit like this you can see and today because teddy bears absolutely love picnics we 're gonna be making a picnic basket so I 've already cut out my template like this and what you do when you get your square piece of paper snip snip but not all the way because what we 're gonna do is we 're gonna fold these bits up and then stick them together so how are you gonna stick them I 'm gonna use stapler but you can use scissors or blue or sticky tip you can use sticky tape or glue not scissors so it means dye scissors to cut up paper and before we staple them together just run out of staples paper I can hear as well do lots of things we might want to decorate our basket so I 've just left it plain just while I 'm showing you what but I think that you can color in all sorts of pretty things on your basket what 's your Teddy 's favorite color maybe you can color it in your basket in that color so there we go nice and cute and then we 've got our little handle move [Music] aside it 's a cute little picnic basket it 's perfect for a little dolly another thing I 've done and I would love it if you could do is I were taking a picnic so let 's see what I 've got I 've got like a little it a pizza bread I 've got a yummy slice of orange I 've got a good piece of chocolate cake because they 're all very yummy at a picnic some delicious watermelon and a sandwich and a special picnic plate so then you can color in all the foods that you like to take on a picnic and cut them out and put them in your basket now this basket is a little bit small it is perfect for a little doughy or the little teddy but Jeremy my friend who 's still snoozing is he 's got a bigger appetite than that so I went ahead and got this bigger basket ready just for Jeremy 's tummy so if you use a bigger piece of paper you still use the same template a square piece of paper cut in the corners just make it a bit bigger and in this one well why don 't we wait Jeremy up and show him all the yummy you wanna see what we what do we have and you can share a picnic with all your toys you can get a little picnic rub lay them out you can take a photo of your toys and you enjoying your picnic and eat all the yummy paper food that you made what do I eat it you can 't just pretend to eat it like this delicious sandwich mmm Jeremy Johnson mm-hmm so we 've got a little sandwich and oh this is Jeremy 's favorite food it is an apple and while we 're doing this I 'll just say that play play is so important for everyone at this age so people learn through children learn through play especially if they 're trying out new sounds like maybe their teddy has a very crumbly tummy more they try out new words oh these grapes are scrumptious and when we play we exercise our imagination so these sorts of activities are really good for learning and also for early literacy so keep doing them at home as much as you can all right now all we 've got time for today but we how goodbye song which is open shut them all right Jeremy you can sit next to me and we can do it over and shut them don 't fall

    "text": "hello and welcome my name is Jiang and I met you at massage instructor and in this session what I 'd like to do is show you some tips and techniques help come su and says we were baby now babies cry that 's just what they do it 's a way of communicating to you they cry because they 're too hard torch and cold or perhaps it hungry or overtired and some babies quite just because they want to be picked up and hold and cuddle because they 're finding they 're transitioning to this big wide world and they 'll be daunting and that 's all fine and normal and what you 'd expect sometimes some babies quite open above what would be considered the average crying time and the reason for that would be things like weaned colleague constipation or even reflux so what I 'd like to do first of all is clarify some of those terms so there 's a clear understanding of what each of those and then I 'd like to go through and show you some techniques that you can use colleague isn 't a diagnosis as such it 's more a term to describe the symptoms that baby 's display so these symptoms tend to be there crying and upset and appearing to be in pain drawing their legs up it often happens in late afternoon into the evening and sometimes into the night it usually begins within the first couple weeks of life and it usually concludes around 12 to 14 weeks sometimes it 's a little bit of confusion as to what actually constitute constipation the constellation really is more the consistency of the store rather than how often they go so for example a breast air babe you can go maybe a week and when they do go miss Thornton 's nice and soft however say a bonafide baby or baby that 's has had been taking solids sometimes it can be two or three days between stores and when they do go out you decide and pepper me so in that case that talking call constipation so with the strokes for the tummy just like a general message is good just together together all the things also handy to have some white and a spare nappy there sometimes the massage will result in them having dirty nappy and sometimes I 'll even pass urine make sure the area is nice and warm for them I just gather to give everything so once you start massaging you can just move through the massage without disruption so the first thing before you do start my sergeants is to place your hands on them and let them go you going to give them some massage and they 're going to help to relieve that discomfort for them we put some oil on your hands and you just rub that water together bring your hands very clean hands nice and warm another thing you do is just place your hand on their tummy or your nice warm hand on your tummy can be nice and relaxing just stay with them for a little moment just connect with them talk to them the lid know you don 't in the fittest strike is just basically paddling down so you lining your hand up around the level of their thigh bone and next one after that is what we call the lowercase M so it 's like drawing a little letter n across the tummy so starting up in the corner you go and up throughout the level of belly button with one hand with your left hand then with your right hand probably at same line then you go across the middle at the level of the belly but a little bit above and down on the sides and coming up coming up maybe across and down so if you can imagine that it 's the level of the large intestine so you 're just reading things through with a story so to demonstrate on the doll standing in the groin and coming up one side I begin with the other hand straight across the middle and you 're dropping down coming up coming up straight across [Music] next funding is just having their hands either side of their little hips and then we 're thumbs for Tommy we hips the side comes in a little and you just stroking out so it 's a side with stroke on their tummy some wind in there you just help him to break them up and roads in the bowl yes Jimmy [Music] and then the last one you can do is just with your patio fingers you 're walking across the tummy so starting on the left side so much like playing the piano you ask moving anything is walking across into me naturally again this is breaking up me upwards the wind and helping people is through this test line and then you turn it up just placing your hand so you could do that when you 're doing the general massage routine or you can do that separate from your routine the other thing you can do is to combine some of those strokes into a little sequence or little Kotik sequence which you can use several times during the day so based on this stroke is how the colleague sequence works easier and saddle just resting your hand on the tummy as you did in the beginning and this time you 're doing everything to the count of six so you 're scooping down to the counter sink so you bring it in the counter sinks so one six little legs down I 'm doing that little lower case into coming up and they 're going to the belly button cross the center and down and do that the counter six and that 's two three four it can be relatively firm on the tummy five six and they bringing those little legs back in again for the count of six so well and then just gently balancing those legs down and the whole time you 're doing those strokes you 're just checking in with your baby just to make sure that they 're coping with it and then they 're doing okay so that little sequence you can repeat two or three times during the day there are variations on those strokes and there are other things that you can do to help move the wind through the tummy so it certainly adds with dance bringing their legs in and out but you can do that in or March a minute so one after the other or if you don 't bicycling a little bit faster the and then just gently surfing around so it 's almost like a massage in the tummy with in Lille 's this primary I 'm just gently [Music] let me strike you would just be a little bit hoarse up if you baby had any hip problems you just want to check with the doctor before we did this one there was any concerns and one other than one you can try is like like the mini player so the plow is yoga pose they don 't really plow similar position and bringing the feet up extended their legs extended now with this strike in fact with any of the stroke you would never push against any resistance so if you baby boys tan someone 's resisting don 't push you might want to give their legs a little bit a juggle and maybe talk to them and they might come up next enough to be able to do it but you certainly wouldn 't push that in push them into that position if they were resisting so they 're just a couple of other little strokes or positions that you routine there are a couple other positions that are worth trying as well and one is called the tiger in the tree pose and that 's basically having your baby just across your arm almost just tucked into the bunker the over again so you 've got some rolls of order between the layers and your hand on their tummy so putting a little bit of pressure come warm from their tummy which is really good when they do have tummy pain the other hand free it gives it back a little bit of a rub and this pose is best to understanding so standing up and then you can be just gently Rocking this is a really relaxing accompanying position having looking down turning away they can certainly help decrease the stimulation and often they don 't over stimulated they do cry a lot and this just brings everything down industry causes a stimulation and also you 're having them rights and price and that will come with it it 's a really lovely position to try another way you can try it is up over your shoulder this upright position over your shoulder but you can bring it up a little bit higher so basically their tummy is tucked in onto your shoulder so again you put that pressure on the tummy and from this position you can be rubbing their back and talking to them and comforting them this way why not the position that 's well as trying is over your lap they 're having a legs out stretch bring your baby down on doing that making sure their face is clear your legs having them nice and supported and then you should gently bouncing them your legs just a gentle rocks and gentle pounds now what that does is again you 're putting pressure on the tummy which can be very relaxing for them and also the movement can help with the movement of the wound and into this you can just add some gentle almost like the beating of your heart just nice and rhythmical and in this position bringing them up close to you and give them a big hug and a cuddle so at the end of any massage is nice to and reassure them let them know that they did a good job and hopefully they 'll be a little bit more settle as a result of their massage now what 's important to calm Susan says your baby and hopefully you have a few techniques now that you can use it 's also really important if you have a crying an unsettled baby is to take a little bit time for yourself just for some self-care it 's a couple really important points that I want to share with you and for you to think about so first of all and probably really importantly you must remember that your baby 's crying is not your fault baby 's crying they probably cuz they 're trying to communicate things to you but they cry also because they have problems as a result of things like weaned and chronic and reflux which are things that are beyond your control so while it 's frustrating and sometimes soul-destroying when your baby 's crying endlessly and you feel like there 's nothing you can do to settle them it 's not your fault you tied in with that it 's really important tonight to be reassured that this isn 't forever babies a help wind and colic and constipation and reflux these things tend to occur early on in the baby 's life as they 're transitioning into getting used to having food in their tummy or something starting off with milk in their tummy and in hemming food and as they get matures these things at least symptoms will start to settle down so just to be reassured and to know the words to treat at the moment it 's not prettier your baby looks set on a reasonable path the other important thing I think to think and consider is to ask for help now I 'm sure you all heard in saying it takes a village to raise a child and there 's so much from the entity in that it can be really difficult being inherent and extra difficult if you put a unsettled baby so really important that you seek out help in your community 's awareness with your mum 's group or family or extended family or friends is really important so just take the time to sneak out like minded people and gather together your little tribe of people around you to get the support and help they need so thank you for watching hopefully you picked up a few tips and techniques on how to come to consider your baby message is such a lovely way to connect with your infant and I really encourage you to take some time in your day just to incorporate it with a message to certainly incorporating stories we talked to here today but also to learn some other techniques and other strengths that you can use during the day with your baby so thank you for watching and just enjoy and love this time you have is about you _"

    "text": "hi everyone and welcome to the first city of joondalup online Lego club my name is Nikki and I 'm Annie ina together we 're going to be bringing you some fun and exciting Lego themes and challenges to do basically if you 've been to Lego cut in the library before you 'll know that someone we have some rules because we 're running our Club online things that might be there might be a few changes but it 's important to keep the same rules especially if you 're sharing Lego with family members so rule number one is respect the Lego be safe and wash your hands before and after using it and secondly don 't three the lego rule number two keep your to build areas tidy have a tray or even an odd pillowcase to keep your Lego on and then have a separate tray and build area to keep your build on and rule number three is share if you 're creating and building it with other members of your family make sure that you share nicely and don 't take pieces if they finally clean up when you are finished playing with your Lego make sure that you put it away if you stand on the Lego it hurts and Lego can be easily lost each week we 're going to be bringing you three activities our first activity is going to be all about lego minifigures money did you know there are 4 billion Lego mini figures in the world that is the largest population group anywhere in the world wow I did not know that that is amazing well speaking of minifigures so each session we will randomly select a minifigure and we 're going to ask you with an adult 's help to send us some creative ideas about the character that we 've selected so we would like you to answer five sorry four questions in a very short five word response and each session we will share some of the funniest and most creative answers you come up with the questions we 're going to ask you to answer each week is number one what is my job what job do you think that that minifigure would be could be anywhere in the world that you choose or maybe it 's not even in the world maybe it 's somewhere totally different in the universe oh and number three what is my favorite food and question number four what is my favorite book so let 's start with our first minifigure for our very first LEGO Club Manny and I 've got six different minifigure cards here we 're going to put them down and we 're going to randomly select a very mini it is the weight lifter that is a very interesting character so money how would you answer those questions for the first one now what might the weight leave to do as a job I 'm going to say a personal trainer because this minifigure likes to help people stay fit and healthy and what about question number two money where does this many people live this one likes walking outside being in the sunshine I 'm going to say a Venice Beach in California and if you don 't know where Venice Beach is maybe after this session you could look that up that whoo that was the favorite food wasn 't it umm what might this mini figure love eating I think it would be McDonald 's because they do like to be fit and healthy I think for breakfast every morning this weightlifter has a broccoli and spinach smoothie mmm yum nice and creamy you know what about number four what is my favorite book book so you probably think this minifigure is really tough and strong strong Rayven wouldn 't have any fears whatsoever well this weight lifter has a bit of a secret she or he is actually scared of the dark so every night to help go to sleep he reads a book called when I 'm feeling scared wow I wouldn 't have picked that at all he 'll I tried so remember to keep your answers to five words or less and at the end of that session we 'll be giving you the email where you can send your answers to and hopefully your answers might get read out next week alright and that brings us on to activity number two and this is where fact or joke mmm Nikki I have one do you have it Marnie what is the most common operation in a lego hospital most common operation [Music] that 's a tricky one oh wow I give up plastic surgery oh I should have guessed that one shouldn 't I ah so if you have a fun joke like that or a fun fact like Nikki gave us with the amount of minifigures in the world please send them in to us cuz we would really like to hear them okay so for our final activity it will bring us to our theme or challenge I 'm doing the online Lego sessions we 're going to be setting you a theme or challenge each week you can play with your family members or you might just like to play on your own today 's theme is going to be colors yellow blue and red and we 're going to show you we 've been hard at work creating some of our own bills so what we 've come up with for yellow we 've done a little playground here and it roundabouts and a slide down here and it doesn 't matter if you don 't have the same pieces that we have you can just use what you have at home that 's awesome I love that one so for blue what we 've come up with is a rock climbing wall so you can see this minifigure here he 's holding onto the rope to make sure that this minifigure doesn 't fold and if we turn it around we can see that it 's being held up with these other bricks so that is our blue one and I wonder if those many figures know the weight lifter because they 'd have to be pretty strong oh they would you need beating muscles to pull yourself up there and red so maybe I will just see this one is a love heart and we 've popped a picture behind this one because we thought maybe some of you are missing your family members at the moment you might have some cousins or grandparents that you 're not able to see so you could either draw a picture or get an adult to take a picture of it and send it to them or email it to them and I think they would really like that right so just remember you can take as long or the little time as you like with your build and once you finish get a grown-up to help you take a picture and then email it in to us and we 'll hopefully be able to show it at our next session so remember to be as creative as you can you can of course you can look at some ideas and get some ideas from us but it 's your own creations that we love to see the most all right coming close it 's time to now go and get a grown up we 've got some really important information to share with them about how you can get all of your three activities your minifigure answers your jokes or fun facts about Lego and pictures of your build added to our next Lego session the email address that you need to send your photos and answers to is libraries at in the subject line put Lego club sorry that brings us to the end of today 's session so thank you very much for joining us we hope that you had fun because we certainly didn 't we Nikki sorry for now if you can get busy building creating and sending us lots of emails we really look forward to that so for now build on _"

    "text": "as parents we pick up we hold and we cuddle and chorus how babies could you know that what works for Sue 's and calm and settle them the baby marriage really is an extension of what we enjoy to be doing as parents all we know is that we 'll come and settle them so welcome my name is J and I 'm an infant massage instructor and in today 's session in order to go through with you some of the basics of baby massage so I 'd like to talk to you deliver practically allergies and things like that we 're in the winter massage we 're not to massage and then I 'd also like to demonstrate some strokes you can use so in terms of where to massage where we are now is by far the safest place so in sitting on the floor with your baby rather than up on a change table and it 's more of a safe you sure the change table they can roll removal and very easily forward to the floor the floors are second place the other thing rotary for your silly internet silages together to give it everything that you need so usually boil and get rid of all your going to be using have to change your clothes for your Bob maybe for the water for yourself turn off your phone and put some music on in the background so what you 're really doing is just creating a lovely calming environment that when you settle down with your baby to do the message you can just slowly and gently move through the bedside without any disruption to your routine so in terms of when to massage there 's no absolute right or wrong kind of massager baby some people prefer massaging in the morning some like in the afternoon and some like to incorporate into the nighttime routine it doesn 't really matter where in the day you massage what are you looking at right as we 're in your baby 's sleep cycle that you 're massaging so you babe all the cycles through a number of sleep cycles within a day and the smaller they are the younger they are the more times and they wake the little bit drowsy then they go to the quiet in other ways whether it is lying and they 're quite contended happy go to the active stage so this will make busy and that 's when the oil runs start rolling and playing and then from there they go into they 're tired sign so they 're rubbing their eyes the yawning they 're crying they look like they 're ready to sleep and then from there of course is moving back into this mood and so they 're not cycles through that several times during the day so the very best time to massage your baby is in the earlier part in the sleep cycle so not long after their work enough and that 's a quiet alert place if you wait till the end of the sleep cycles so towards their going back down for their sleeps you 'll find that some babies find that over stimulating to start massage at that time and they 'll get quite quiz knee and unsettled so then they don 't you join the wrestle time and neither know they were very very best of all generally speaking you 're in the sleep cycle is the best time to massage a baby there are times when you wouldn 't message a baby as well so if your little one had any major medical condition to us perhaps had surgery perhaps has had issues with their hips these a lot of conditions you 'd be willing to check a few GP about before we started massaging more general sort of thing is just to keep in mind is a few babies have had their vaccinations they can often be quite practise an unsettled and sometimes it 'll be finished and have sore legs as well so you probably want to hold off the massage for maybe 24 to 48 hours after that their vaccines any other time you 'd be cautious with massage is when they had fevers all right oh well so you just wouldn 't mess up during that time you wait to learn a favourite past you 'd be certainly cuddling or holding them and reassuring that way just really nice Arjun so in terms of use on your baby and it 's really a matter of trial and error to find out what ones they like and what they don 't it 's really important that you follow your baby 's lead and follow their cues in terms of massage now before you start them outside one important thing just thing consider is what we call the permission sequence so it 's just basically asking your baby is it okay if I give you a massage and it simply put your hand in front of them and saying do you want a massage initially of course they 're going to have no idea what that means but over time this will become very much a work response and we may see you gathering everything together and then your hands in front of their face they 'll know is that a message is coming and they 'll very clearly answer you as to whether they want one or they 're not just purely by digital body language so if they 're happy the massage using your eyes are wide and bright it 's smiling they 're not wanting to besides I would disengage from you they 'll be Chris maybe the face of groomers and they 'll get little bit agitated so just follow your baby 's lead give the indicating they want to be met sides and absolutely work your way through the message if they 're saying no I don 't want to be message that 's fine as well just leave it at that time of the day I made try later on or maybe just leave it for another day it 's also really important to keep checking back in with your baby during the massage so any time if they indicated that they 're not enjoying the massage or this time to get unsettled with it just stop so it doesn 't matter if you 're going down one leg and they start to get grizzly it 's fine to stop at that point you much better off doing one or two minutes are a good quality massage rather than pushing through and doing 10 to 15 minutes a message from both you in your baby aren 't enjoying it so just want your hand and warm the oil so it 's rough but really feelings between hands mom did a really nice base to start you just gliding your hands onto the noodle chest I 'm just staying with them for a few moments before you start the massage so from here just really connecting with you about so maybe you can close your eyes I was taking a few breaths nice deep breaths nobody drowned until they were breathing you better go they 're just going up and down you 're going to go a little hard for you through these years for just take the moment to connect your writing because position you can come up and ask do you want a massage wait for the response if they 're happy you can start this trick really is just spreading it over so it doesn 't matter which leg you start with that 's really all over and then you 've got one really long lovely out one stroke to get the message going so you 're straightening up the leg one hanging after the other just making 're rolling so put their little leg between the palms your hands and you 're rolling from your thigh to being cool when we get to the top go back down and from here you 're circling so support this with the pads you can get into the muscle the thigh and plant in the back and onto the car they 're just always remembering just to make this stroke relatively firm because it can get a little bit ticklish you shall touch his light from here we 're going now circles are on the ankles tips a little foot down and then you 're drawing line one for each time [Music] I 'm coming back what 's a choking they 're usually so little time between your fingers or squeeze and come up one for each time [Music] the base of the foot get rid a film create the entire length of the foot a nice firm stroke so making sure your boat strokes are always boom because it can get a little particulars for the room of the headlight and feel me hand flat on top of the opposite to heaviest owner so now we 're walking back working back towards the body and coming back down the leg can fly one hand in hand in after the other and you do the same again on the other leg so you probably need to chop up your oil at this day to live with more well warming up and where you going it 's reading the oil and then distant lovely long outward stroke to start with entire to ankle only a little link between the palms your hands help and then circling into the muscles having the leg well supported with one hand the other hand in the shape of a seat is simple around the ankle bone from here if you then look down into a line for each time come back each toe under the time just a little squeeze [Music] here you going to the base of the foot so worried long line all the way down the leg through the foot that to the foot food with the rub and then working back towards our body so having the lead supported and bring finish bear sighting one pilot but it 's always nice to do a long stroke just to go over what you 've already done and sort of come down the legs and off the time and then from here you might need to top up on the oil and then just Claire glide your hands onto their chests just rest your hands on their chest and they come up from their shoulders down the shoulders and the side of the chest I wanted a bottom rib up to the center and then up the stone was almost like you 're drawing a little butterfly across their chest and somebody said like a VHS massage and that 's absolutely fine you just follow your baby 's lead if you 're enjoying it continue with the massage if anyone just stop when you come again over everything we 've done so fun young chess and their legs will move on to the face so just risking your hands either side of the little head and let your thumbs for of the eyebrow line working away across the eyebrows here moving on to on to ears just here between your fingers give the wrong school you can come off working way around me like the one year at a time you guys together [Music] we 're here just moving on to the head it 's just the pads and fingers gently massaging into the skull remember you 've got the two little soft spots there just avoiding any pressure making sure your life.you touches a passing light when you think they 've had enough come back then over what we 've done just a little face look they 're on there and then we can 't finish the message it 's just nice to rest your hands a little somewhere in there no that 's I just started so just as you had the start point for the permission sequence it 's just really nice it 's and finish ovens they were all done with and I just so they 're quite through input at this point you 've wrapped them up in a blanket or towel what if you put there and just bring them up close to you and this is I was trying to just holding them close to the register in that moment with them in you might want to close your eyes just stay connected with them build a little breath I didn 't go through there heart beating to ingest help you up to smell you they can hear you you can hear your heartbeat just take a few deep breaths and just me move down and it gets appears to be uncomfortable so hopefully that 's given you enough information to get going or your massage journey it is just such a lovely way to bond and connect with your baby and to go from all the benefits that hairstyle for including it improvement or sleep I am certainly helping this think those related to win new colleague and relax so I just like to finish off by just saying when you begin massage and start bringing massage into your day not to make it a task don 't make us something you have to do just make it part of your daily routine that way you 're going to enjoy a lot more and you not what it 's all about it 's just meant to be something lovely and beautiful and bonding that you can share with your baby I think the other really important thing is just to trust just to trust your ability as a parent and just to trust that you know your baby very best of all so thank you for watching and I really hope you enjoy your massage time with your baby _"

    "text": "hi everyone i 'm amanda kendall and while i usually speak in person at city of joondalup libraries right now we 're doing things a bit differently that coronavirus pandemic has affected everyone in many ways and one group of people who 've been affected are travel writers now they 're the first to admit that being unable to travel is a pretty privileged problem to have but when you make your living by traveling most of the year it 's still an actual problem the silver lining is though that for us uh these people are now grounded and they have time to talk to us so we have put together the grounded travel writer series today i 'm chatting with caro ryan a travel writer video producer and wilderness expert based in the blue mountains welcome to the grounded travel writer series caro hey thanks amanda thanks so much for having me it 's it 's nice to be in your office yes exactly i wish you were here in person but this is a good substitute for now at least so it is indeed so can you are and how you 're coping with being grounded absolutely absolutely so i am clearly home uh and home for me as you said is the blue mountains in new south wales so for those who aren 't sure of exactly how far that is from sydney so it 's about an hour and a half to two hours uh due west from sydney and we 're at about a thousand meters of elevation so it 's pretty chilly because hey winter is coming um so i live about or about a five minute walk from the three sisters so most people are familiar with those three amazing rock um formations and that 's where i am and yeah it is a beautiful beautiful autumn day with blue sky and the colors on the leaves are all changing so it 's actually not a bad time of year to be home and the fire is on in the corner that does sound if you 're going to be stuck somewhere it sounds like a pretty good place to be stuck it is pretty nice and it 's a great small and um yeah creative types around um so and it 's really nice actually because it is traditionally a tourist town so to actually have a tourist town without tourists even though it means you know not great things for the hospitality and for the tourism industries here for the community for the people who live here we 're actually getting to see what our village and our town is like yeah without without all the visitors every day yeah yeah yeah sure there 's some downsides but that is a quite a positive thing to happen isn 't it so kind of nice for the community yeah um okay so you 've traveled a lot can you tell us about one of your most memorable travel moments um yeah gosh there 's been there 's been a few and i and it is it 's like you just said it in your intro it 's a bit of a first world problem and it 's a it 's a real privilege and and it 's an honor and i certainly don 't take it lightly um the opportunity to memories that stands in my mind is in a small south pacific island in the far far north of vanuatu it 's a place called uraparapara great name yeah uraparapara i 'll let you google it and look that one up but it 's an island that uh is in the shape of a u so it 's a u-shaped island because cross-section it used to be a volcano that was a peak and it blew out one side of the island so as the volcano blew out one side this is like you know 144 000 years ago or something like that you end up with this u-shape so the i was on a tiny little fishing boat and we got inside the island so we actually came into the reef um just on sunset and yeah there was it was pretty sketchy there for a moment trying to actually find somewhere to anchor without being on coral and without gumming around um but we sailed in at sunset and because it was dark and you couldn 't really quite see just knew that there was this land form that hugged us and then in the morning to wake up sunrise inside a volcano was just this it just complete pinch me moments like uh you know i love pinching moments you go i 'm i 'm inside a volcano and it 's amazing and not only that then i look ashore and i see this flotilla of dugout canoes being paddled across the lagoon coming towards the boat and there was about probably about seven of these beautiful traditional dugouts um being paddled by the men of the village and they they were expecting us believe not they actually knew we were arriving and um we you know we transferred ourselves over into the dugouts and got paddled ashore and i 'm sitting there sort of hugging my camera equipment thinking well one one part of me thinking how do i tell the insurance company while i 'm actually i was i was sailing water out of the canoe too oh no and holding my camera sort of kit in the other dialing water going how do i tell the insurance company if i lose the camera but find out later that the guy who was paddling mine was the paramount chief of the village oh wow um yeah of of the island and that now here is the weird part this is the the part of the story that just it was like this strange kafka-esque kind of moment we get ashore we 're doing all the greetings the hello just incredibly humble to be there and in all this ceremony that was going on and the greetings and and i should say my party there 's only about four of us in in the party and suddenly we 're here and this has taken us three days to get there by the way from port villa so this is not just a single journey to get there you 're in the middle of nowhere really absolutely the middle of nowhere um we hear a phone ring oh no that seems wrong it just it was like what the hell and what is this but i turn around and in this village and i 'm saying this is an absolute traditional village there is very little sign is how people have been living in this on this island for thousands and thousands of years and i look aside and there is a metal it was like a metal totem pole really um in the corner of the village and on the and it was this huge mass that went up and it was a solar panel on the top and it turns out that it was a um a unicef program from about five years earlier where they 'd put one solar telephone and this was the one telephone oh my god connection yeah the one connection to the outside world for safety and for emergencies sure yeah so people would come from islands all around to use this one telephone oh my gosh and it rang as you arrived oh but i mean that all of that makes it i mean it 's a memorable moment for many many reasons so yeah wow i love those kind of stories the kind of places that very few people ever get to so yeah that 's awesome oh beautiful i can picture it uh amazing turquoise water absolute of the the rim of the volcano on one day and it was her hard work hard work muddy steep i came back and i was just covered in mud all over myself and of course you know because i wanted to be respectful to culture i was wearing a big long skirt because it 's a bit hard for scrambling up a volcano isn 't it yeah and hanging off tree roots and all sorts of things to get up there but um yeah i think that whole thing about um just being really respectful to the culture that you 're in and women don 't show their legs don 't show their their shoulders and their arms that kind of thing so hey just gotta do it absolutely it all works out it still makes it all all the more memorable so it 's a great story i love it sorry as you put it on a bit no good um but i 'd also like to hear about a time when something went wrong because sometimes these make the most interesting stories of all that they do that come to mind but to in the efforts of keeping short um i will think about the time in peru and i was on a trekking expedition it 's a 13-day trek and it 's a circuit and you can 't really come in and out it 's like you 've got to start at one point and there 's really no villages there 's nowhere to come out until you come back right so you 're committed once you start you 're committed and we were at altitude and it was the first time in my life i 'd really done altitude and and it wasn 't like huge epic epic altitude but we got up to uh about just over 5000 metres so when you consider mount kosciuszko here in australia that two thousand two hundred it 's double so don 't over double that and you start to most people sort of start to feel a bit shorter of breath around three thousand so you know it was like my first real challenge and and um if anyone 's familiar with the movie touching the void had the rope cut the mountaineer and he fell yeah great movie if you haven 't seen it anyway so it 's in that area it 's in that the why wash area um of of peru and the guide that i was with was a company i 'd never been with before and had come highly recommended which was great um but my first time an attitude and he strongly advise people not to take dimox and not to take which is an anti-altitude sickness medication um so me wanting to be the nice compliant person that i am i i did what he said and i did everything else i drank a lot of water i made sure i d basically i was just trying to do all the right things now this has nothing to do with fitness it has nothing to do with body type it has nothing to do with age it 's completely indiscriminate and um at about day four i just started having a really really horrendous time and i 'm gonna i 'm not gonna swear because you know thank you very time of it and um i remember feeling like and i and i get migraines i get mind goings on my life so kind of used to what a bad headache feels like right this was like something i had never felt before and um just like your head in a vice and pounding in every heartbeat you could feel through it and not sleeping at night and not breathing properly and then it was when i think i i i had a someone took a photo of me and my i was there with a friend and she was doing she was fine she felt nothing at all but i looked at the photo and my lips and i was blue and purple oh wow around my lips and my mouth and my fingers and my face and my eyes and everything had puffed up and i was just having a horrendous time of it and the guide was um he was young and he was fairly inexperienced and he 'd been a last-minute replacement guide from the guy who was the experienced one so in the end i concerned with my symptoms and having a background in search and rescue not at altitude but kind of understanding a little bit about expedition medicine i 'm like going because there 's a there 's a point you actually start to mentally lose your capacity as well and decision making goes up right and they actually call it the i won 't use the word but the f it factor where you actually start to just not care anymore which is not like me at all you know in an emergency situation i usually get quite responsible it 's like i couldn 't care less and in the end my my friend um you really need to yeah start taking diamox um so and it was the happy ending to the story is that yay i did not end up with a really acute case which is very very good news because yeah can be really serious yeah really serious and they 're like i said this circuit walk there was no exit um but i did make it to the end and it 's amazing when you start taking lot better oh my god oh my goodness oh that 's so frustrating isn 't it two photos side by side yeah of the days before diamox and the days after dive box because if the drug you should take actually a few days before you get to the location okay acclimatising yeah yeah and um we were doing all the right things you know walking high sleeping low all that stuff they tell you but yeah the two photos from before and after just like chalk and cheese oh wow gosh and i 'm just annoyed that you know my memory of the first half of that which was in stunning stunning country i have very little memory because it was just this little card by the whole yeah hey yeah i guess trust your guts if you go things aren 't right something 's not right yeah then do something about it yeah that 's right wow yeah that is um that i know that can get really serious so i 'm very glad that it turned out fine so i 'm pretty glad to go back now yes yes oh my god oh wow that 's heavy um all right so hopefully soon ish we 'll be able to travel more again which is will be a joyous moment um so looking forward to the future can you let us know a couple of places that you 're really looking forward to getting to once some travel restrictions are lifted yeah absolutely well i 'm excited to see more of australia and it 's something even before covert happened last year pretty much the 12 to 18 months ago i 'd sort of said to myself you know i don 't really want to do big overseas trips so much anymore when there 's so many amazing and incredible places and people and experiences here in australia yes so incredible so i 'm the first place on my list is something that 's been on my bucket list for years as a as a hiker um so i 've never been to the warren bungles um so the warren bungles national park in new south wales out near kuna bara brand so that 's on my list to hear about is i really want to spend more time in western australia wonderful news so um and not just for typical places and walks that people are familiar with like you know you 've got your popular walks you 've got the bibbulmun track you 've got the cape to cape um but you know i 'd love to spend more time up in the kimberley i 've done a couple of big off-track walks up in the the southern cardboard range and the coburns which was pretty pretty amazing so i 'd love to go back up to the kimberleys um but even just more even around perth i 've got some old friends that i 'd love to pop in and see fabulous i might even have to have coffee with you i might have to yeah so definitely more in australia yeah yeah oh that 's a wonderful selection and of course you know being quite biased i 'm happy very happy to hear western australia coming into that list we definitely have some really really beautiful spots and uh i think that might be a while we 'll be focusing more on on australia so and uh we often don 't do that because we go for something more exciting i suppose but it 's not necessarily more exciting there 's lots of amazing places to see here so yeah i think that how the gras people think the glass is always greener absolutely actually it 's so lush and incredible and the one thing i really want to see i want to stand in some of those giant carry forests that you guys thought we have amazing forests yeah yeah i 'm very excited about that oh excellent well i hope that those days are not too far away and uh thank you very much for joining us for the grand old travel writer series thanks so much for having me amanda all the best and i 'm quite excited i want to hear all the other people you 're going to interview watch this space sounds good thanks carol see ya _"

    "text": "hi everyone I 'm Amanda Kendall and while I usually speak in person at City of Joondalup library events right now we 're doing things a bit differently the corona virus pandemic has affected everyone in many ways and one group of people affected is travel writers now they 're the first to admit that not being able to travel is a fairly privileged problem to have but when you make your living by traveling for much of the year it is a real problem but the silver lining is that for once we have a lot of grounded travel travel writers who have time to talk to us so we 've put together the grounded travel writers series today I 'm chatting with Tracy croak an award-winning travel journalist who you 'll often find exploring the world on her mountain bike so welcome to the ground a travel writer series Tracy oh thanks Amanda thanks for having me and hello everybody it 's so lovely to chat with you trace so can you tell everyone where you are now and how you 're coping with being grounded well I I 'm coping we 've been grounded is like a lot of trouble rights as we take in time out I suppose reflect and relax and perhaps you know get round to all those things we never do like clearing out our photos and some editing jobs so that 's so good and the great thing about Glasser they 're not single thing about Monday they 're in co vide it 's been one of the clusters cuz it 's very busy but it 's it 's a beautiful place that 's also very easy to get into areas even as busy as manly where there 's all these little secret coves and we 've got a national park one kilometre from manly beach which you know I 've just been appreciating my backyard more than ever that 's what I 've been doing I think that 's a good way to do it and we are lucky here in Australia that we have been able to get outside during this whole pandemic and get out there into some fresh air so I know you 've been making the most of your travels tres can you tell us about one of your most memorable travel moments yeah well this was what I call my spiritual experience with a great warrior central and it was one of my more challenging travel experiences where as you said you know I do a lot of stuff on bikes and I like to travel by bike because you see the reality of a country but this was one of the more challenging ones so I 'll put some context around that I was on it I was part of an expedition to cross the tallest mountains in Kyrgyzstan and this is an extremely remote area of the world and so remote it 's not even mapped properly so maps take back 30 years to the Russian days and their large-scale so in terms of navigation they 're not that useful and navigation relies heavily upon the local knowledge and the local knowledge there in the mountains is the nomadic mountain people who go up there in the summer to graze the herds and some song lived there permanently and settlements in the lowlands but it 's very very remote and people don 't really live where we were going and so as we met know many people and and you know when upon this journey they would say this phrase to us all the time and it 's a well me it 's a phrase of you know well well wishes and it 's I 'm going to try and pronounce it it 's manis turn are Biggie coldest in '_''_221.37 and that means may the soul of manners protect you now explain humanity yes I do so in Kyrgyz and identity Manas is very important because he is like this superhero legendary warrior warrior who united the forty clans of the region you know thousands of years ago so it 's a symbol of independence for the Kurdish people and His image and great statues of him can be found all around Kyrgyzstan it was also a highly skilled horseman so he 's often on his horse another says all part of this independence of Kurdistan and the way it was explained to me was that Manas is almost like the soul protects my question was would this protection transfer to like longer Gurney 's very foolish foreigners going upon embarking upon a journey that they didn 't actually you know me to care tape but never nevertheless this is the culture of the mountains and all nomadic people there will help you will guide you will share food with you and this is what they said to us so we 'd hired horsemen because we needed our camping gear to be carried for us but the trails that bikes can take and the trails that horses can take a very different so some days we 'd split we 'd go off up Amish or too steep a route with the our day what we needed for the day and then we 'd meet the horsemen later and they would take a route that was suitable for the horses which was usually a longer but lower route yes so sometimes we split and over a week we were well into a week this sort of two week expedition and quite a lot of gone wrong it 's towards the end about ten place puppy that was caught up in some kind of wire trap we 're carrying this problem with us we were running out of food and we were extremely tired and one day would that we would split from the horsemen in this way and we were trying to get to them to I come in a volley that night and we I just can 't tell you how many times we had attempted to find the route to this valley and we 'd met nomic nomadic people that day so we were in trouble we were looking at a very cold night on the mountain with not the Brett gear it was getting really late when we found another trail that we thought would lead to this valley and all of a sudden this great herd of sheep and goats you know started towards us and I can say that I did have a moment where I thought it might say on my epitaph but you know here life tracy krause squashed by a sheep I 'm glad that behind was a very kind thumley ana Becca nice bum Lee after where it 's flames for me said we know where you trying to get to and obviously this was all translated through the translator that was with us so I 'm you know paraphrasing all this but he said he knew the trail we 're trying to get to and he will send his son code and call with us not just to find the trail but through the through the night about four hours they reckon to where our camp was and then he will sleep then returned the next day and so obviously we were overjoyed but you know first he said no yet you know first you must eat at the top of the mountain so at the top of this particular trail Ana Beck and his wife put down a blanket for us and if their doors and and then as it got dark his son Cody Cody uncle led us to the top of the rise and and it was really dark now and we could still see the trail because it was a full a full moon so very bright and you know of wild horses just galloped up to the rise and if you can imagine like the full moon behind and I kid you not and they the stallion was rearing and you know promising against the full moon and we were so tired and beaten and cold we couldn 't speak never mind get our cameras out and I just said you know there are some moments that I just meant to be experienced and just when I thought it couldn 't get any better code code and Cole turned towards with a big smile on his face and said you know here it is here 's the trail and that 's the moment we found the right trail after six attempt so gosh I 'm not a religious person but I believe that was the soul of mark Manus and the spirit of man is telling us and yes I do protect foolish boring with yeah on these questions you 're safe now amazing it just seems like a massive movie panorama that someone would would invent to make a climax to her to a scene and to think of keep pinching myself about it had I not had all the people that who just remember it and never stop talking about it since and almost like you know well there was three guys and me but we 're almost like brothers and sisters now that we came through this experience yes you have a lot of stories to tell so I 'm gonna let you tell one more though can you tell me about a time when something went wrong yeah well funnily enough on the same trip I 'm surprised the context now so and one day where we were at camp one evening were at camp and we met a young and what 's called I think the right pronunciation he 's digits and they 're like mounting cowboys and again they have you know herds in the mountain and particularly different from nomads because they 're particularly skilled on the horses and what up but anyway this this night he came into our camp and they had his herd of cows with him and he explained you know that the winter was coming quicker than to the town which is I don 't know maybe three or four days away five days away so in there in the spirit of the nomadic culture and the mountain culture of course we invited him into our camp and we and we all our food together and he slept in our camp at night then the next morning we you know we said our goodbyes and what have you and we were packing up and about to self on our bikes and AK our page and we look round and with a translator and we said it must belong you know to the to the young cowboy so and off we went on this mission to reunite the cow and me heard a car which don 't people with our butts like go off where we even needed a you know to go this day and but now we must do the right thing so about half an hour props an hour later we found him you know we were delighted with ourselves at the which point each turned round and said that 's not my cow so to the wrong person the car with the wrong and then had to herd it back and leave it where we found it because it probably belonged to somebody who had a settlement maybe you know I knew they did just wander into the camp so there 's a fairly logical assumption to make fair enough such a remote area yeah and with such an emphasis on that culture of everyone helping each other and doing the right thing I think you were definitely doing the best thing you could we were so excited to do it well it makes a good story I don 't know anyone who 's headed a cow with their mountain bikes okay there you go actually on the same trip to Shepherds borrowed my bike and want it one of the other guys bikes to have a go at seeing how you know they could heard yeah ended up wrong like have got I 've got a video of this poor Shepherd going over my handlebars but they decided not to use that technology for the future breaks like really hard and then he landing I 'm really glad yeah change anywhere in the world as United and you know United me with people in that kind of way and just crosses it manages to cross language and culture and everything because of all these shared experiences on bikes so yes it 's fabulous isn 't it I love it um can you tell us Tracy a couple of places that you can 't wait to explore once we can travel more freely again well in this respect I 'm probably not really gonna answer the question in in actual places but I mean I would just stick to my principle that I always have and that 's anywhere that I haven 't been and anywhere that 's not crowded you know and I 'm not saying not crowded because of kovat as I said before I think that when there are so many places in this world but if you were to tell me somewhere you know in a country that 's really famous and that everybody really wants to go to I could pretty much find you a place that 's like under the radar and you know travel is such a force for good and bad but I think the of these crowded places they do attract the bad things in trouble that the bad impacts generally that 's my experience I 'm only speaking for myself you could have some really responsible people who know how to you know navigate all these like crowded or what I would consider sometimes on over tour places and and do it very responsibly and I deliver a talk on that because I would just but you know I just love to get as I say to see a place on a bike because it shows me a bit of everything and the reality and my hope in a post Kovach world is that more people want to spread the tourism love and perhaps you know travel a bit more thoughtfully in that way yeah I hope that 's the case too and I look forward to seeing where you end up so thanks heaps Tracy for being part of the grounded travel writer series today you welcome thanks for listening everybody bye _"

    "text": "hi everyone I 'm Amanda Kendall and while I usually speak in person that city of joondalup libraries right now we 're doing things a little bit differently the corona virus pandemic has affected everyone in many different ways and one group of people it 's affected has been travel writers they 're the first to admit that being unable to travel is a privileged problem to have but when you make your living by traveling most of the year it is actually a problem the silver lining of that is that for once these ground and travel writers have time to talk to us so we 've put together the ground and travel writer series today I 'm speaking with Kathryn Marshall Kathryn is a journalist and travel writer originally from South Africa and now living in Sydney she is one of Australia 's most awarded travel writers and is usually very hard to ping down while she explores the globe so we 're lucky to chat with her today so Kathryn welcome to the grounded travel writer series Thank You Amanda it 's lovely to be with you a bit more about where you are now and how you 're coping with being grounded well as you said I 'm in Sydney and I 'm sitting at home I have one dog on my left and another one nearby I 'm so I 'm very much living the homey life at the moment and I 'm coping quite well with being grounded I 'd actually originally voluntarily grounded myself for the first quarter of this year and just to take a breath and to catch up on some work and and so I have been quite enjoying that the extension of that grounding and enjoying the things that one doesn 't really get to enjoy as a travel writer spinning around the world things such as you know gardening and reading and all those typical things I 've actually been quite enjoying the the change of seasons you know it 's it 's winters sort of creeping in and and I 've almost noticed the the tilting of the earth and away from the Sun each morning I walk out into the garden and I notice how the it 's been quite enjoyable being able to to to appreciate those things that we don 't normally get to appreciate and when we 're on the road mmm and also and I 've been doing a lot of reading and reading about travel so that 's that 's been keeping me busy too it 's a semi-decent substitute I suppose for actually being out there yeah I 'm chair travel I think it 's a good right now reflecting on some of your past travels can you tell us about one of your most memorable travel moments well yes and I think actually being at home also allows one to to do that to reflect on one 's travels and as travel writers we don 't often get that opportunity we don 't have a much much time in between trips and but one of one of my most memorable travel moments was travelling to the Republic of Congo or Congo Brazzaville as it 's also known and this was a trip that was really around eight years in the making and was something I 'd dreamed about for 't even been built when I first started thinking about it and it it was I was traveling to a place called odds are Lukaku National Park in the far north of Congo Brazzaville and it 's a part of the the Congo Basin and that vast Greenbelt almost an impenetrable Greenbelt and that 's been you know written about in books like Conrad 's heart of darkness and Barbara Kingsolver s The Poisonwood Bible so this place had really been conjured in my imagination and it was being opened up to two tourists of course it 's still very much off the beaten track but it 's home to to a group of waste lowland gorillas these are endangered creatures and they 'd been almost decimated by Ebola in the beginning of the the thousands and there is a primatologist from Spain who 's been working there for close on 25 years I 'm researching these animals and habituating them so we actually got to when I was there I got to to go on to tricks and tracking these gorillas and and on both occasions we actually saw at a respectful distance and funnily enough we actually had to wear masks the minute we got within a certain range of these animals our range instructed us to put our masks on because respiratory illnesses are passed very easily between primates and humans because we share so much DNA and so we had to put our masks on pull our mosquito nets back over our our faces because you know of course we 're in the in the tropics and there are plenty of mosquitoes and and creatures like sweat bees which which gravitate to you since you 're sweating profusely under those climatic conditions and and so that was very very special and something that that that has really stayed with me how many gorillas did you say you know group each time um I think the first one they were around 10 that we saw in the truth probably around four or five of them at fairly close distance and the second time was particularly extraordinary because we had been hacking our way through a very dense undergrowth and and the the tracker kind of parted these a tree was a silverback and he kind of turned around and looked at us and we had we had to keep a there are very strict rules in place about the distance that you keep but a little later and didn 't excuse me we then saw a member of that group walk out from the bush and actually turned to look at us and then start to dig for for roots around a tree and that was pretty extraordinary because and that was a new root sight they call it a root site where the the the groups dig for roots and until then that particular site hadn 't been documented so we were we were seeing something quite quite exceptional very very memorable yeah yeah now another thing that we always like to talk to people about is when something goes wrong when you travel because often that you bring back the you know the most interesting or the most fun stories from something going wrong it 's you know it 's usually not a disaster in the end it 's usually a good story so I something went wrong on your travels well you know um touchwood I 'm one of those people who hasn 't experienced um lost luggage terribly much a couple of times but it 's been thankfully on the way home so it hasn 't been a great problem um you know they 've been a few delayed flights I 've been involved I was caught up in a cyclone once but probably probably the most frustrating thing that ever happened to me was I 'm I was with my family in New York my husband and three children who at that stage was sort of teenagers and we we started our journey in New York and and we were then going on Chicago to to commence our road trip and following route 66 front which runs from Chicago to to Los Angeles to to Santa Monica and we were so we 'd spent a few days in New York in New York City and we were then due to catch a flight and we caught public transport we hopped on a bus we were going from LaGuardia Airport got to the been delayed and that we had been put on an earlier flight but actually that we were too late to check in for that flight not very useful and we we were we were not told when when the next flight would be available and so and I said to the woman at the at the check-in desk and why has our flight been delayed and she said Chicago 's got weather so that 's become a bit of a trademark phrase in my family Chicago 's got weather that 's kind of and I remember being rather perturbed and thinking well surely everywhere has weather you know explain what the problem is anyway as it turned out she kaga Saqqara had terrible eye fog and so they were accepting some planes but not all of them anyway so we we waited for six hours and we were then put on a flat after six hours it was tricky because it was we were a family of five seats for all of us and this flight would was going by a Cleveland and from Cleveland that would then be flying boarded we landed in Cleveland late that night our luggage of course was had been checked in and we were then told that actually the onward flight had been cancelled because Chicago had weather and we were put into a hotel without our luggage and we were ordered to be back at the airport at 00 the next morning so we had a couple of hours sleep got back to the airport next morning to find a sign saying your flight has been cancelled we were then put onto a flight back to New York and we were then in New York a few hours later put on a flight to Chicago so we eventually landed in Chicago 24 hours later the long way around after a bit of a whirlwind trip and Chicago did actually have weather it was freezing so bitterly cold but I must say it is a beautiful city and I 'm glad that we that we finally made it and the rest of our trip went off mostly with that incident we did have a bit of a break into a car in Amarillo Texas too much weather yes not too much in fact the weather improves a great trip as well that 's part of the world I 'd like to explore someday so highly recommend it yeah speaking of exploring the world someday we 'll be able to travel again so can you tell me a couple of places that you can 't wait to explore once we can travel again well you know funnily enough I am this very week as we as we speak I 'm supposed to be in birdsville in art back queensland yeah um I was going to be doing another road trip I 'm from Charlotte Oh to birdsville meeting characters along the way finding out how people have been coping with the drought which is something that has really fallen off radar given the bushfires and then coronavirus and so I was really looking forward to that trip and um I 've done a lot of travel around Australia and a lot of road trips and but that 's one part of the world I 've been too shy level but I certainly haven 't_''_820.6 been that and I 'm pretty sure that trip will go ahead at some stage so that 's something I really can 't wait to do in May I was due to visit for the first time Ireland I haven 't been there before funnily enough I love Ireland yes and I feel that I feel connected to it somehow even though I have never visited I had some heritage there so but one of the trips one of the things I was planning to do was to walk the carry Camino which is the section of Camino that pilgrims would walk on their way to Dingle to catch the ship to Spain right to then go onwards to Santiago de Compostela so I haven 't_''_874.45 walked the Camino before but it 's something that I think I would like to do it it 's I love that idea I love walking and I not a terribly good hiker but I love that idea of just being able to meditate on the road and to that it 's that slow travel really that I think I find appealing yeah yeah and 's really the antithesis of how we travel otherwise especially of how we get to places which is you know we we compress time into into 15 hours or eight hours and when we when we get onto a plane and and shoot off um so I would really still love to do that and and to explore Ireland in more depth I 'm another place that I 'm looking forward to visiting and and this is a trip that I had properly locked in was was a trip to Sudan and towards the end of this year and so being from Africa I 've done quite a lot of exploration in Southern and Eastern Africa a little bit in West Africa but that part of the world I 'm very interested in both politically and culturally and Sudan is certainly opening up to visitors so I do look forward to visiting sometime maybe not this year but hopefully sometime oh yes yes oh that 's a fabulous set of future travel dreams I hope ya all come true and thank you so much lovely to chat to you today grand and travel writer series thank you for inviting me Amanda and happy travels to you in future too _"

living by traveling most of the year it is a real problem the silver lining though is that for once these grounded travel writers have time to talk to us so we 've put together the ground and travel writer series so today this is kim yeol kim is a writer and youtuber who spent nearly all over the last few years away from her native United States she and her husband WAV run a YouTube channel called Kim and Wei documenting their journey visiting 60 countries together before Kim turns 60 in a few years time so welcome to the ground a travel writer series Kim well thank you I 'm not sure I want distinction but it [Music] but I appreciate frustrating to be grounded at the moment um so perhaps can you start by telling us where are you and how are you coping with being grounded so we are in this ghetto which is a very small small town outside of San Diego California it 's up in the mountains it is literally the best place to isolate because you can count the number of cars that go by our house on probably one hand during the day so it 's my mother-in-law 's home because we don 't have a home because we are full time travelers so when they say stay at home that means a little something different to us and how we are coping I guess that depends on the day right I think that 's true for us all we have good days we have maybe some not so good days but overall you know my other than being stationary and in one place my day hasn 't changed I still write most days I still you know have income which I 'm very fortunate to have so there 's happy to spend some time with my mother-in-law I 'm AM admittedly getting the itch though so like all of us it 's been an adjustment but we are handling it as best we can hmm yeah that 's good to hear I hear you on the itch it is sometimes it 's not even that I necessarily would be traveling now it 's the fact that I absolutely can 't my mother-in-law was wanting to go to Costco and the store is really really bad and a friend of her said not to go to go it just makes me mad that I can 't go I don 't even really need to go I just can 't_''_179.78 so yeah I 'm feeling that too yeah it 's that trapped feeling sometimes isn 't it so well let 's think about some better better earlier times can you tell us about some of your most memorable travel moments so I 've been thinking about this a lot because I think when people ask me my favorite my favorite country my favorite moment it 's sort of like picking which really hard to pick one because like how do you choose between being on the Great Wall of China or maybe having a private tour of a 17th century fortress in Marseille how do you choose I chose watching the sunset from the piazza michelangelo in Florence Italy it is a cult-like experience so first of all it 's upon a hill overlooking the city so it has the best view of the city and hundreds of people every day hike up the hill to watch the sunset there are food vendors and music and people are toasting each other and it 's just full of so much joy it has sort of like a mini festival type of atmosphere but this particular sunset what templates are my thing I love all sunsets I think they 're all special but this one we went to go take our seat on the steps and you sometimes have to elbow your way in but we were there early enough we had our wine we were half and they started playing the ukulele version of over the rainbow great which is a song start to cry now because I 'm sitting there the Sun is setting the sauce comes on I had goosebumps I 'm crying the Sun sets everyone 's cheering it was like I kept thinking this is a sign I 'm not sure what it 's a sign for but it 's a sign it was magical and I 'll never forget it and I think Lawrence holds a special place in my heart just because of that one moment it was really really special it really it really was and yeah in fact I was just telling my husband I need we need to go back I think one of our first destinations even though there 's so many places might be like let 's just go to Italy I had a dream the other night that I was flying Italy and I remember being so happy in my dream and then I woke up so sad unusual coronavirus induced dreams at the moment so it would be nice if it was not a dream you woke up from and you really were on your way to Italy but moments wind trap when you travel but sometimes the memorable ones are when things go wrong and I have to say I have a I have a morbid curiosity about stories of when things go wrong because they often turn out to be really interesting funny stories so can you tell me about a time when something did go wrong it 's a you know I really thought about this I have to say I think I live under a silver star or something because for the most part things have gone right so you hear wrong you hear travel I think you mostly associate that with lost baggage so I definitely have a weird lost baggage story so I was traveling from Sonia China which is a tropical island sort of across from Vietnam looks very far south all the way home to Phoenix it was about a thirty nine hour travel day I was not looking forward to it it was long and I get to just Sonia I check in my bags and I make a point of asking do I need to claim my bag from 't there doesn 't seem to be a solid fast rule but if there is a rule in place they 've want to change it they 're like no no just pick it up in LA I verified like five times because I just knew something was gonna go wrong it 's the state of the frequent traveler isn 't it do it I just knew it so I get to Beijing and I had a long layover so it 's not like I II had to rush through I had six hours there so I go to the airport lounge and I 'm hanging out and just doing stuff and then I you know walk around the airport a few times and go back to the lounge sat for six hours I go to this gate an hour early because they 're a little militant it 's their airports it 's the only country in the world where if everybody 's on the plane they will take off early Wow they will look asleep I 've never had and China is a lineup culture so everybody is there early but I was notified that 's a gate about yeah it was good and I like taking up early too it 's am I just a little afraid they might forget me one time they have it yet so I get to the gate it 's about an hour early and a gate agent comes up to me and says you know are you Kim yes I am did you claim your bag and go through customs and recheck it and I said no because I specifically have not to do that or like no no you have to do it I go well do I have enough time can I go do it now well yes you have time but no you can 't do it okay why well it 's just not going to make it on the plane and I 'm like so I 'm here it 's an hour before departure you know I 'm here you have my bag I will drive the cart to get it on the plane but if they it 's like they have a method to their madness and there okay no bags we 'll put it on the flight it leaves in a few hours it 'll get there you know a little bit after you but we 'll deliver to your home in Phoenix okay no problems make la cut them quite easy for me cuz I don 't have my bag that 's true so okay fine I get on the plane and they came and gave me something a forum to fill out I 'm like should I fill it out now no no you can 't fill it out can you get to Phoenix okay so we go on our way I go through customs where 's your bag it 's stuck in China and then I could take them line I 'm like I 'm not lunch so I get to Phoenix and I try to fill out the form and they 're like no no you can 't fill it out until after then why I can 't remember exactly but it was something like I had to wait another four hours before I could fill it out a sec traveling for 39 mom 's house luckily I was going to see my mom wearing her clothes no big deal I didn 't really care I just wanted to sleep so the next day I call American and I said is Mike white is my bag coming in and they 're like we don 't have any record of your bag my point well you mean you don 't have any record of my bag and I said so that like okay so they take all my information again they well the tight the air like I was flying China China Southern Airlines China Southern hasn 't released the bag to us and I 'm like well go get it like I don 't understand literally back and forth for five days luckily though I did eventually get it wrong I 'm up her what happened American had to go do something like extra special because China Southern wasn 't releasing the bags it 's only your bag could talk I tell you the tale I know like my little lonely bag sitting there in some compartments somewhere like me home but I so you know and a story and it in a living a horrible story like none of it made that play just that was the crazy part is like just none of it really made sense mm-hmm I heard some similar lost bag stories I 've got one of my own where there 's nothing about it that makes sense but that 's kind of part of the thrill of travel isn 't it absolutely I mean I we tuck our bag because we live on the road I mean you know the best pattern isn 't it 's not an option and we have we carry all of our important stuff with us like our camera gear is usually with us on the plane so if our bags go missing I figure I can go buy an outfit it 's never a big deal so I I 'm surprised that the only time I 've lost the bag yes we 've been doing it a lot so yes you can 't_''_759.23 be losing a bag right now because there 's no travel time but hopefully I mean definitely sometime the road again so can you tell me a couple of the places you can 't_''_771.86 wait to explore once we can travel again so this is a really hard question too because like so many places right I want to go everywhere and I want to go everywhere again there 's so I had to think about it so right now if the craziness of this world did not happen I would be in Myanmar and I have wanted to go to Myanmar for a long time it 's really high on my bucket list so obviously I 'm very disappointed that I 'm not there um you know it 's been closed to Westerners for so long it 's still not really heavily thirsted like there 's just not a lot of tourists that go there because there 's a lot of some hoops you have to jump through to get there so that 's really really of interest to me but there 's other places like I want to go on the tram Siberian Railway and I want to go lope in the Dead Sea because like know for that cool thing I want to go to the Bolivian salt class there 's so many places but I think oh the other place too is Bali I was supposed to go to Bali after Myanmar on my way to Australia so that 's like so bad so so many places obviously a lot of where that next destination is just going to depend on a who will accept us visitors cuz our you know we 're having our spikes from now so yeah I don 't know what that Porter 's are gonna be like yeah so we 'll just have to play that by air but I wouldn 't be happy going anywhere really yeah just get on a plane anyway will do he 'll have us yeah yeah I know I don 't even love getting on a plane because I do it so much but like right now I 'm like God airplane food sounds so good well I really hope that you you and we all get to travel again soon and that we don 't have to have a grounded travel writer Australia soon yeah thanks so much thank you thank you

    "text": "[Music] hi I 'm Rockland and welcome to the first in a series of videos which looks at why people dance why I dance and why I think you should try so when I was first asked to do these videos I thought to myself what better way to give back to the city of Student Life and the community within it and the wider community which gave so much to me from growing up in the city of Joomla I actually grew up in the city of Woodvale and live there for nearly all my childhood and all of my teenage years before I moved on to this new professional training as a dancer and a singer and an actor and travel the world now a lot of people think why do you need to study dance if everyone can already dance and that 's a really great question the way that I would answer that is to say dancing is a lot like baking a cake everyone can bake a cake if you have the right ingredients you need flour sugar milk eggs four simple ingredients to make 't eat cake different story but I like to think that sure even we 're gonna eat that cake and they 'll enjoy it but not for a while of eating the same cake or even making a thick cake you start to think I 'd like to try something a bit more and that 's when you can introduce different ingredients like chocolate lollies carrot more chocolate more sugar clean these possibilities are endless because the more ingredients that you have access to the more versatile your cake can be and the same thing goes for dancing the more you know about dancing and the more that you understand the way that your own body moves the more versatile and enjoyable dance can be one of the biggest questions people ask me is what is dance and I like to say it is one of two things it is art and it is athleticism however it 's not just one or the other but a combination of the two because when it comes to dance you can 't_''_128.159 be just an artist and just an athlete yeah it 'd have been sitting at home watching videos like this on the internet or we don 't know how long I certainly can 't remember the first time that I started going into quarantine and isolate I certainly do know that it 's time that I got up and moving so what today 's video is all about is warming up first off you probably ask you mean why would I want to warm up I don 't need to warm up while it 's warming up I just want to dance wrong warming up is necessary because not only does it prepare our body for dancing but it also increases longevity and the endurance skills that we need for when we are there so in every war mark there has to be three steps first of all you have to have your cardio which increases your heart rate and help oxygen flow to the rest of your body there 's your stretch to prepare the muscles and joints and ligaments and tendons or for strenuous activity as well as it helps to increase the range of your MOOC and thirst a spin push-up and everything in between people ask me why do I need to do this step do the thing is about making art and being an athlete if it 's about endurance if your cardio fit run but this is where the athleticism comes in dancer makes dancing look easy but here 's a secret that nobody wants to tell you dancing is hot the way that you make it look less hard you got air conditioning so in today 's video what I 'm gonna do is I 'm gonna show you a very basic warm-up what you want to do is you want to prepare say to yourself about the distance of your arms with nice little square and you can do this in your bedroom in your living room your kitchen outside and your lawn in the back garden anywhere that you can still socially distance to another person within one and a half meters and more than anything make sure that there 's nothing around you that you could run into so what we 're going to do today is I 'm gonna take you do is listen to my instruction put on your music and then let 's get started so you can start any warm up you like in cardio as simply as you like you can see I 'm doing some step touches and I 'm just swinging my arms loose not the joints because the shoulders and the hips will be used a lot when you start to dance I 'm also showing you from the back just so you can see what it looks like very loose very free and again you can do this just finding the beat in the music so of course with any sort of cardio warm-up we need to get the cardiovascular system working cardiovascular system is your heart and all of the veins and arteries involved you can see just a simple jogging on the spot I 'm changing direction because it gives the sense of direction and also an awareness the space I 'm going to dance it you can also try doing jumping jacks or star jumps depending on what part of the world you 're from and you can see over my toes and also making sure that my heels fully touch the ground with every jump this is really important because it helps protect knees and hips when we start jumping high up later in the exercises I 'm also doing some crossing Jack 's here going from an exposition to a cross position this is just a variation on its star jump exercise and you can see that I 'm adding another variation going a little bit deeper into the bend just to open up the hips then up and down exercise is a really great one when you 're trying to get your heart rate up you can see I 'm punching the four corners of my box the harder version is to touch the floor a little bit easier if you just reach towards past the knee skipping is also a really great way to get your body warmed up if you don 't have a lot of time or you want to focus more and moving past the cardio phase of the exercise I tend to skip or a variation of 100 and then take I 've done jogging I 've done jumps between each I also attempt to go for a lovely skip kick but you can see that my coordination like a lot of other people is at the best now we move into the stretch phase of our warm-up I like to always start with the part of my body which can often be the most neglected which is the neck and the shoulder you can see here that I have taken my ear to my shoulder and then I 'm bringing my chin to my shoulder and all I 'm doing is lengthening the opposite arm towards the mat and I 'm not pulling I 'm just adding extra weight you see on the other side here I 've got my ear to my shoulder adding the extra way lengthening the other harm opening up that space and then again cheering it to shoulder of course I sped up this though you can follow a home as fast or as slow as you like but for the purposes of keeping the video short I 've made it a little bit faster any parts of my neck adding in the arm stretch I like to go as wide as I can cross one arm over the other then the arm that 's below comes on top of that to create a flat side positive sign you can see that I 'm doing on both sides going as wide as I can and then crossing over again I 'm gonna show you what I tend to see a lot when I teach and that 's some people get a little bit lazy with this no no no you 've got to keep this active stretching is always active that 's the way that you help prevent injury as soon as you think that a stretch is a relaxed position you are not doing it correctly now I 've got one arm on the back and swapping over again I 'm not pulling anything I 'm just creating tension a little bit of pressure I 'm taking it out of my neck and lengthen to my back if you shoulder rolls just to check for anything shoulders adding the elbows and of course full we gotta go forward and ready to continue the stretch the second most forgotten about part of stretch is of course our wrists our hand courts and our feet we see here under stretching and flexing started with both and now I 'm alternating just to sort of bring awareness to those tiny muscles which are so important always working in an upward rotation and then incorporating an inward rotation you can do that for as long as you need I 'm showing you from the side a butterfly stretch you can see here that I 've got my soles of my feet together my knees are apart I place my elbows on my knees and I 'm holding my ankle is not Mike 's feet now I showed you a flat back position and then a curved back and you can alternate trying to see which one is best for you following this we moved from a stretching up from the hips to and linking the hamstrings I 'm going for my knees to my shins to my ankles again just creating movement wiggling the toes touching your toes see that I 'm going for a full stretch in here again lengthening through continuing with our hamstring stretch you can see that I have isolated one leg I have made sure that I move my other leg in without shifting my hips I 'm not leaning to one side opposite hand reaching for the little toe on the opposite foot my nose to my toes no no no top of the head to the pose you want to lengthen forward again this is an active position and I 'm activating my core as I do it again I 'm not staying completely still I 'm moving through my isolations because I want to create an active and strong of core as I can been doing these exercises now moved over to the other side again not notice the toes top of the head to the toes and I 'm not leaning on anything but I 'm making through that stretch being a little bit more here going from a plank position to a lunge you see that my leg is at a 90 degree angle so my elbows and not anything the back leg is stretched backwards and the front knee stretching forwards and then alternating to the other side you can see that my bottom half of my leg and my arms are in the same alignment to best facilitate this particular stretch now a different way that you can stretch your hips as well is to go into a lunge forward not the most ideal way to just relax it all you want to engage the core keep the back of straight as you can and then you 're tilting away from the hip that 's being stretched you can see here that a small stretch like this can do a massive impact and then on the other side making sure that I still have my a line of my knee and my hip and my toes in line with my knee and then that gentle stretch over the side a more advanced version of this of course is to lean forward getting that lunge position but instead of going on to the foot we 're putting the weight on the knee opposite arm reaching back to front hamstring stretch and then bringing it back into a lunge showing you on the other side so you can see from the camera reaching forward foot and hand in line with each other and then also bringing that back leg in remember you 're not pushing yourself so hard that it hurts you 're just creating functional movement and then back into that lunge position just to show a nice even align at the end of your stretch this might be a nice time sort of check for your flexibility is that you can see here that I 've gone for a straddle stretch or a middle second position and I 'm just sort of seeing where my hipster at and seeing how far I can push that gently again I 'm not forcing anything for just finding a passive and an active position and finding that comfortably moving on into our conditioning you see a different types of push-ups your traditional pushup going into a tricep pushup with the elbows close to the body and then a shoulder push-up where you make a triangle position you can also trying on the elbows if that 's too difficult you can go up to your hands as well trying to create a long plank abs are so important to this exercise making sure the heels are in line with the hips going from crunches and from crunches you can also incorporate full situps feet a little bit further away the goal here is to keep these shoulders and the elbows in line not bringing the elbows back forward like I 'd have to do standing lunges are also a really great way of conditioning the hips to get ready for large jumps you can see you can do step ones you can do Isolators so one side inbred petition to make these even more challenging I like to do jumping lunges keeping those arms up making sure that the alignment is very careful here further than that you can add squats weight must go over the heels and not over the toes because then you fully activate your glutes as you can see here my weight is going back and not forward to make those more challenging of course you the toes and watch as I land that I 'm going through my feet that 's very important bring in the upper body back in you can incorporate dips this is a really great exercise to add a leg raise to after you 've done your hard exercises to really lock into that idea of using multiple muscle groups to maintain control I like to test my control with some held and Static position very positions can be done from sitting or standing you can see here that I have a parallel to the front and then to the side and then you can test either side the best way is to create a table position and then test what your balance may or may not be doing raises a really good one to do as well but remember raising involves focusing on your entire core your back your upper back and not just what your anchors are doing and it 's remember we are practicing together building skills so okay if you wobble and fall over now remember the very end of your conditioning this is a great time strength and flexibility I like to do at the end of my stretch a check of my splits left leg and right leg in the middle and if you want to know more about splits you have to come back and check out one of my other videos which is increasing your flexibility at home thank you so much for joining me in today 's video I really really enjoy dance because it brings a community together so you don 't always have to be in the same room to be a community one of my favorite things about dad getting up being active and working on some skills I hope you really enjoyed today 's video the next couple are a little bit different from today 's warm-up we 'll be looking at how to prepare for a dance class and what to expect if you 've never been one before in flexibility training like I said certainly does help be something that a lot of people don 't really get a lot of information about is how to prepare for an audition unlike a regular job interview there to show you in that video and then finally something which everybody arms about they come to dancing you how do I become a better term and I 'll be showing you that remember up for everyone there 's no such thing as being perfect than the arms everyone can do it remember keep on dancing [Music] _"

right gonna do another repeat after me so I 'm gonna do a lot of songs I think it is not so much I 'm not a singing teacher in any way we 've all met Stephin we know she is the singing teacher extraordinaire but I do feel like singing and dancing brings a bit of playfulness into our performance work and into a rehearsal room or into our classroom and I think that 's really important I 'm the one honestly in my car on the way to an audition that is doing exactly this blooming really wait for Winnie and really I am doing that stuff I 'm the one in there in their waiting room before I go into the audition I 'm moving around loving myself and doing this kind of thing singing songs to myself probably to annoy everybody else but that kind of thing brings all this really vibrant energy into your body it gets rid of anything else that you 're thinking about and it gets you ready chan yeah repeat after me please it 's one of my favorites now seven seas she sailed across that channel too and she took with her our Rikki bamboo I don 't recommend blue now what is that it 's something made by the princess hi it 's red and gold and couple too that 's why it 's called I reach the bamboo now Captain Jack and it 's mighty fine crew they sailed across the channel too but their ships sank and so will you if you don 't take our Rikki bamboo I recommend boo now what is that it 's something made by the princess pie it 's red and gold and purple too that 's why it 's called already bamboo I know you 're probably thinking our niccola a lot of the songs involve shaking your tail feather once again remember playfulness is really part of drama not taking yourself too seriously and being able to shake off some of those things that keep us very rigid and serious and and sometimes self-conscious throughout our day it 's about throwing it all I say very often to my adult students imagine that you 're performing for children 're doing no one 's looking at you and judging you and it 's true somebody in the corner are you are else watching from the couch going what are they doing but the fun of of your warm-up is everything I feel because I haven 't have been in spaces where the warm-up was taken very seriously and and it did a wonderful job warming up the tool that is your body but it did nothing for the nerves and it did nothing for the energy level in fact it probably brought it down a little bit [Music] [Music] [Music] that was excellent work I 'm so glad you came on the journey with me so the following workshops that I 'm going to do I 'm going to look at a monologue this will happen when you do a play or a film and you 're a great character and you get to do a great character monologue also necessary when you do an audition then we 're going to look at some scene work also of course part of the tools that you 'll need of the of time doing Shakespeare I really want you not to be afraid of doing Shakespeare some of the best productions I have ever been in have been Midsummer Night 's Dream and Macbeth much ado about nothing and once you have some really great tricks under your belt you are really going to be able to go into that space confidently and then we are going to have a mock audition once you come into these auditions you get to prepare and if you 're feeling like it and I encourage you to you 're going to send those audition monologues into the city of Joondalup and then we 're going to select a couple of you to come and join us in a live session masterclass and I 'm really excited about there be brave be prepared to be confident thank you a great day and I 'll see you next week my grandma and your grandma sitting by the fire my grandma said to your grandma I 'm gonna set your world on fire talk about hey now hey now I go I go on they break it come on feet on it hey hey come on feet on a hey hey come on be 9a hey _"

    "text": "hello and welcome to your first singing lesson as part of the triple threat project brought to you by the City of Joondalup and their arts and isolation program my name is Stephanie and I 'm going to be your singing teacher for the next six weeks I have over 15 years of teaching and performance experience both in Australia and overseas covering a variety of genres from opera all the way through to jazz and pop now you might be asking yourself what 's a triple threat a triple threat is a term that we give to someone who can sing dance and act our objective in these videos is to help you strengthen your own capabilities in each of those areas so I 'm going to be looking after the singing Laughlin 's going to be covering the dancing and Nicola will be covering the acting over the course of the next five weeks I 'm going to focus on one or two technical ideas associated with singing and then giving you some exercises to practice at home in our sixth week we 're going to be hosting a short video of you singing something that you absolutely love to the city of Gendler from those submissions we 're going to choose a handful of people to act as active participants in the masterclass now please don 't be afraid we want to hear from you so whether you are an amateur that has never sung in front of anyone or you 're somebody that sings on a regular basis we would love to receive a video from you we want to show you a variety of singers all at different stages in their own singing journeys now a few housekeeping rules before I go into our first video one if at any stage you feel uncomfortable or something feels tight and constricted when you 're trying to complete the exercises stop that 's your body 's way of trying to protect you and say something 's not feeling right I don 't want to continue it 's also a great opportunity for you to look at getting some singing lessons with a singing teacher who might be able to identify what 's happening for you and then with a freer instrument and it feels more organic for you too if you have a pre-existing medical condition that might affect your ability in completing some of these exercises or at any stage you feel dizzy or lightheaded especially in this first breathing video stop again your body is trying to protect you we don 't want to be receiving letters saying love the program but cracked my head on the floor after completing breathing exercise number one and number three possibly the most important please give yourself the space and time to enjoy these videos and by space I don 't just mean the physical space I also mean the mental space this is your opportunity to disconnect from all the stress of life and reconnect with yourself and reconnect with how you 're feeling and seeing what your mind and body are capable of achieving it 's really important that you give yourself that luxury of time to enjoy these videos to their fullest so with all of that said let 's move into our first video and deal with the breath look I would have done so I 'll just do this why am I starting with the breath as singers there are four key phases that we need to go through in order to produce different sounds one I need a energy source which is my breath I need a sound source which is my vocal folds or my larynx area 3 I need a resonant source so things like my oral and nasal cavities and then forth in order to produce different sounds I need articulate errs such as my lips or my tongue now the breath is super important because that is the thing that gets everything going it is the fuel that powers our sung sound so before I go into the breathing exercises that are designed to improve your breath flexibility let 's just do a check of how your instrument is looking your whole body is your instrument and what a beautiful looking instrument it is we want it to be in the best condition it can be in so that it feels ready to sing so let 's just do a check of how your instrument is feeling now your bedroom and you 've opened up your cupboard and you 've taken out a piece of clothing that you love to wear now I mean that jumper that has all those stains on it but that beautiful exquisite piece of clothing that probably cost you a fair bit too and I just want you to look at it and picture it draping off the hanger and how much respect you give it and now I want you to pretend that this is you now you are that beautiful piece of clothing hanging off that hanger draping down to the floor and we 're going to try and have this idea that our skeleton is that hanger so we can just hang off our skeleton it 's does such a wonderful job for us takes away all the stress that I might be holding in my body so let 's just check that stress so I actually want you to squeeze really tightly everywhere and then release and squeeze and release how good does that feel and in that release position we 're now going to work from our head in his free position as possible so we 're just going to start with going side to side with our neck yes totally tight on my right side today and in that you can even start to siren sorry [Music] now if you 're finding that you are tight you can just start to spend some more time during your practice on stretching out either of those sides staying there for a period of time and asking it to release and now we 're just going to check the head weight as well so we 're going to play off that axis of letting the head fall and then letting it rock back and again somewhere along that axis is going to feel really natural and free for me to just let my skeleton do its job moving down into the ribcage area I 'm just going to start to move to make sure that I 'm not locked and then I 'm gonna start to put in some intercostal stretches so I 'm just taking that arm over and the same deal you can siren through here oh and 'm gonna ask it to release oh yeah that feels so much easier for me and you can give yourself some love you can hug around the back again just getting everything nice and open and now we 're just going to check the lower half of the body so we 're going to just be playing with that difference of weights are coming forward and going back obviously if balance is an issue for you please get a chair and then again somewhere along that axis I 'm gonna feel that really comfortable elegant spot and for me it feels about here and then I 'm just gonna check happy horsey just trotting along checking that knees aren 't locked wiggling my toes and then again thinking of that beautiful skeleton now draping in its space and you 're scalars can have the feeling of both stretching up and down towards the floor and that your whole body is trying to encompass a 360 feeling I try and feel like the breath the inhalation is going really deeply into your body almost that you could picture it as a to your feet so if you find that you feel this sense of lifting or that your sternum is raising really higher during your inhalation so something that looks a bit like this I 'm gonna ask yourself to set yourself the challenge to see whether you can allow these to relax you can still keep the sternum feeling quite open and free but you want to try and feel that the breath is going down into your sides and through your back and filling up your whole body rather than this high breath that we associate with being really stressed and anxious I also want you to try and use the breath as much as possible in each of the set of counts so don 't have this feeling that you 're trying to hold on to it so you can get through a phrase or get through the later phrases I want you to use it get rid of it bring it in and get rid of it so we 're really thinking of ourselves as this beautiful elastic machine the counts are going to be going from gonna start with an inhalation of four counts and then you 're gonna exhale over four so for example I would breathe in over four exhale over four and so forth the counts are going to go four into threes into twos ones and half counts so this half count you 're thinking that the breath is trying to pour in as quick as quickly as possible and then you 're trying to get rid of it as quickly as possible so as an example it 's like you 're a beautiful set of pillows in front of the fireplace you 're ready to give it a shot I 'll be doing the counts for you with the numbers of duration that you 're about to go into so the first one that we 're going to start with is a breath in over four counts and a breath out over four counts here we go making sure our instrument is ready to go and in two three four out two three four in two three four out two three four in 2 3 s 1 2 3 1 2 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 s 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 is 1 to 2 in 2 out 2 3 s 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 out 2 3 4 s 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 finish society the SZ vowel exercise in this exercise we 're going to go from an unvoiced consonant out s into a voiced consonant at some pitch our zipped into a vowel in this case we 're going to use an R back to a Z back to an s each of those is going to have a 4 beat count and we 're going to try and do the entire thing in one breath regardless of what style of singing you 're currently doing so for example whether your sung sound is something like ah-ah-ah-ah ideally I 'm gonna keep you in a range that 's fairly comfortable no matter what kind of music you 're currently singing so it would sound something workout ready to give it a go so again think about your instrument are you ready is it open let 's do this and yes said sit yes yes sit ah see it yes yes zit is it yes yes is it sit yes yes sit sit yes one more this way yes Zee zit is coming back down and we 're gonna go slower yes sit yes yes said is it yes yes sit sit yes two more yes sit said yes last one yes say it I said yes how did you go _"

    "text": "hi everybody it 's mike palusa here again um getting back to you about exploring your neighborhood with your camera this is the last one of the series and uh it 's been great doing this great fun and i hope you 're getting something out of it now we 're going to look at nature in our neighborhood in our city area or the parks or the coast anything around our area is you 've got nature it 's amazing you know even built up here is how much nature is around so again concentrating on that 's my favorite i 'd say my favorite photographic subject and the fun part of this is it trying to find nature is in itself a very good thing to do it 's very good for stress release in cover 19 times and also it can be very creative and fun and challenging at the same time so let 's talk about nature uh you already know me pretty well by now this is the fourth one but i 'm a photographer writer and i run workshops and also uh do lots of that let 's get down into it because as i said before we 've only got 15 minutes now travel mindset at home travel mindsets something we came up with uh about how we are when we are traveling somewhere whether it be overseas interstate or even away from your hometown in your state uh it 's about the fact that when we are traveling we tend to be a different person we have this mindset of of exploration of curiosity of trying new things uh looking at things with new eyes just taking risk even that you normally would not do at home normally at home you 'd be in home mode work uh playing with the kids that kind of things the things that take up a lot of time are very rewarding but uh different to when you 're traveling it 's about trying to bring that travel mindset back home into your own backyard exploring your own backyard it 's particularly relevant now in covert times but it can be relevant anytime this travel mindset or this feeling of exploration can be very rewarding and now first of all we 're just going to talk about the familiar places the places you know well the local parks the the um the coast the streets around where you live uh any of those sort of places even nearby national parks now that we are opening up a bit uh in coba 19 times uh it can go a bit further afield now so going for walks it 's a it 's a really good thing to do right now great time of year to do it too beautiful weather so getting out there and exploring the parks national parks nearby that kind of thing is really uh adds to your photographic creativeness and also your well-being so local parks like this one uh i think it 's probably uh around um not sure where that is might be in hillary 's but anyway that 's academic you know it 's near the hill there we 're just going to talk about what 's going on when you 're exploring areas which are familiar to you you 've got to look at uh start looking a little case look at this couple here taking photographs of something which normally you just walk across walk over and not even think of it i think she 's photographing a leaf before you do that you 've got to be in a relaxed state because i i feel that photography brings you into the moment and once you 're in the moment all your stresses basically flow away and you become much more relaxed so the idea is to become in get into relaxed mode pretty quick before you start taking photographs and then really get into it flight mode on your on your phone is very important you don 't want your phone ringing and pinging all the time that 's the opposite to being in the moment and take and being able to relax so only use your phone for as a camera not for anything else slow down and breathe like in nature when you 're in nature you probably tend to do that anyway but be sure in these uncertain times that your stress levels are sort of having a big effect on your well-being so and slowing down relaxes yourselves and you can not you create better photography but you feel a lot better about what 's going on and for that time you 're out there you 're in another world you 're not in that that world of stress over covered and all that kind of thing that 's happening to us right now in strange times and one of the things that comes about for being out in nature and finding things natural things is that it awakens the senses you actually automatically your senses all may be awakened when you uh out there but what i mean by that is that in a normal city or home life or work life your rush rush rush in tunnel vision and your senses are deaden all that kind of uh that awareness is not there in work mode in tunnel vision mode awaken your senses is about not just your visual sense which is key to photography but all your senses out when you 're out in a park or walking on a trail smell the roses basically you just get what what 're taking photographs what are you hearing the birds the insects chirping all sorts of things happening around the wind muscling through trees and leaves that kind of thing that 's that 's the sort of thing that you are becoming aware of and that 's all part of what i 'm talking about awaken the senses is so important be super observant nature 's one of those funny things that if you go out there and and you 're not being really looking for nature in itself uh you 're out there just in virtually tunnel vision and your head spinning from all stuff 's going on you won 't see a lot of things so really start looking become what i call an expanded awareness see what 's around you and then nates will start to appear even sitting somewhere and waiting for nature to come to you is a good good way of doing it like a park bench you start noticing things so being super observant is the key to all this and that 's the places you 're familiar with so all these familiar places quite different uh if if you start taking photographs of of stuff around the place you 'll find like that you will find basically that you know you might as well be in a new place you start seeing things differently but and even better is discover new places get out of here be a bit adventurous go on google maps have a look at what 's around the green spots the blue spots go these places you haven 't_''_480.479 been to before and i bet you 'll find things you never believe possible and i bet you 'll see uh animals or birds or insects that you didn 't think lived in pushing built up areas so that is a real key it 's basically describing new places like traveling overseas for example a totally new place you don 't know anything about it you can uh you can like an african safari patent photograph animal in african safari well have your own safari your own backyard and see what you can find it 's a really exhilarating thing to do even when uh you 're not locked down that 's what you 're looking for for to find new places you can guarantee there 'll be nature and abundance in these places or trails wa website is a great resource too you can find trails in your local area just look at trails near me and that way you 'll find great new places to discover nature you know its glory really and exploring new places you will you will amazing what you 'll find just in local areas like this place in this little lake in a park off the main road so it 's not easily found except locals know about it is it turned out to be a great spot to take some photographs late afternoon and uh this is what you 're looking for you 're looking for these little places when nature abounds but you don 't have to go outside i mean you do have to go outside you don 't have to actually go too far afield if you 've got a garden explore your garden with your eyes look and look up close get in close and photographs flowers anything what sort of photography you 'll you 'll achieve by doing that especially using getting in close it 's all about getting close into your garden so that 's where the magic lies macro if your camera 's gonna if you 've got a macro setting your camera or or even with the phones you can get in very close get in close and get detail and textures and all sorts of patterns you might find in your own backyard it 's amazing what you can find especially after a shower of rain in this case where there 's water droplets everywhere it 's just magical be patient especially with butterflies and nature is a is a thing that demands you to be patient you can 't rush nature so when you 're stalking a butterfly take your time at slows like in stealth mode it 's all part of the fun sneaking up on these things and and trying to get a shot it 's it 's almost like a hunting instinct coming out except you 're using a camera be sneaky as i was saying dragonflies are particularly they 're hard to photograph getting up early in the morning on a cool morning sometimes you 'll find dragonflies sitting on a twig and they are reluctant to move they haven 't warmed up yet great time to take photographs of dragonflies so that 's part of all part of the fun and getting to know how nature works that 's very interesting stuff bugs and flowers flowers a beautiful photograph easily photograph because they don 't move much you get a bug in the flower shot and that 's what i call valuating it 's a bonus in this case it 's a dual beetle birds that 's patience and luck you need both in abundance you can sit around for ages uh with your camera and wait in a certain spot where you know in this case a honey user will come to your gravity in your backyard and and your notes gonna be there pretty regularly you wait for it that 's your patience or you have your camera with you and sony 's in front of you and uh you you have a bit of combination of both in this photograph and a couple things before you finish when you close up photography uh using close-up photography uh you get what 's called show depth of field basically you have not got much focus range so when you 're using a macro lens or a telephoto lens uh the idea is to focus on the subject in this case this lizard 's eyes the eyes are everything see photography and therefore that 's in sharp focus but the show that the field means that everything else is out of focus which can be really useful techniques especially when photographing flowers but there 's other handicaps so that 's quite quite a difficult thing to do uh and i 'll show you why you 've got to focus very carefully you 've got to then that 's part of the challenge of close-up photography anything in nature you 've got to take your time and you 've got to really focus carefully and keep your camera really steady because sometimes you have to use a fairly slow shutter speed flowers and the wind are a big you 've got that much focus range so you 're really looking at a very small emergent error you can blow in and out of focus the flower because of the wind and therefore you take lots of photographs and you try to judge it when the wind drops and the flowers are stationary as you can and take a photo it 's all part of fun now i think that 'll be it for now it will uh nature is a great subject to chase after and it 's a great way of releasing stress at the same time and it 's such a challenging area of photography it can be a lot of fun it can be a bit frustrating but that 's part of the game and that 's part of the fun uh that 's the last of our series for the moment and uh i hope everybody 's got something out of this um just a little bit of something to do in these cobra 19 times and as you can see you don 't have to go very far to travel you can just travel in your own backyard _"

    "text": "I think once again it 's Mike Plews he here talking about exploring your neighborhood with your camera and during these times as of Kovan virus we I do we have more time to do so not everybody but some of us and there 's also a good chance that we might be under the stress and overwhelm and probably just about how Co birds doing and so it is a great great opportunity to get out outdoors and walk around and in this case I 'm going to talk about walking around your camera in parks your local park and parks man I 've been to before now it 's a very simple premise here that you into trouble I guess everybody likes to follow my workshops not surprising restricted but as a Sydenham first 15-minute talk with new eyes and as is if you are a tourist you in your own place tourism is traveling around seeing new things all the time we can do that too we may be familiar with where we live it 's lots of things we 're not familiar with so this is the near a park or or wherever it might be and taking photos so I 'll get straight into it just very briefly who I am for people who may not know me my name is Mike Alesi I 'm a photographer and writer and onto my wife we travel the world not quite a moment of course we travel around taking photos and written over 80 books and we enjoy our our troubled lifestyle so in saying that because we enjoy our travel lifestyle it sounds like we 've copy suffering at the moment but know what we 're doing is we 're exploring our local area now this is what I called trouble mindset at home what we 're actually doing here is creating the same sort of tribal mindset we had when we were away away in a new place away from familiar people that we know and friends we tend to do things differently we tend to be much more curious we take on different things that would normally wouldn 't do at home we often take photos sort of thing we take do much at work and that kind of thing the spaces of work and so what I 'm trying to say here is that that concept of mindset when the traveling can be transferred to mindset the same mindset at home you can store your place with new ice basically so troubling mindset at home is just about creating that same feeling that you had when your way but at home now first of all there 's two ways of doing this is the familiar looking at places with new eyes that 's what I like to call it places you 're familiar with you might go there daily walking the dock for example in a local park you do the same routine every day you probably not really in the moment at that time you 're doing it because you have to walk the dog but you mind is really full-on thinking about work about family what all the stresses of today we have coming day if you walking in the morning you suit you 're not in tune with what 's going on and then on top of that you might to the stress and overwhelm people are suffering at the moment so a walk in the park should be a pretty pleasant experience but for a lot of us we just caught up with it caught up with all the trauma so it 's interesting what I 'm going to talk about here is the when you go to your local park there 's probably a lot of things you 're missing that you don 't see because you 're so caught up in this tunnel vision and what it is about is to get us open to what 's around us to appreciate what 's around us so the starters if you take them if you take your photographs if your phone put your phone on flight mode to stop all this stuff coming through that 's gonna be distracting you want to actually get in the park your local park with clarity clarity want to have a clear head you want to be able to see things and be in the moment slowly and breeze that 's what I always do if I 'm going to a local before taking photographs take some deep breaths you want to de-stress so you want to be other distress and take some of their anxiousness away when the ways of doing it you deliberately slow down look around take some deep breaths we shall breathe all the time so I think that takes a deep breath and clearing the head and giving the circulation going is what 's required here before you even get started go get their mind right one of the things that often goes by the wayside is the your senses pin to get dulled let 's face it when you television you 're not really smelling the sweet smells of flowers loosely smelling the roses you know you 're certainly not hearing the birds singing and this these sounds have made around the place like Magpies that kind of thing the beautiful sounds that often get caught up with you dismissed basically you 've none of that so but I suggest doing is to just look around stand still take some deep breath smell what you 're smelling and hear what birds hear the awesome wind rustling would not happen if you were in tunnel vision so you pretty thinking preoccupy yourself with new things to change that mindset and the other thing that 's just you familiar places so you 're going around searching new eyes for new things to see which takes you out of this distraction destruction you 're under that 's one way of doing but the other way and that 's really is a troubled mindset at work here it 's better looking you over see so so looking at discovering a new place like walking in a park of London for example you seeing new things all the time so you 've got a different mindset why not bring that mindset back to back home to Perth and explore new places and that 's what I talk about here is a lot of parks is amazing the amount of parks around which you have not visited I 'm guaranteeing you love the area there 'll be places you haven 't seen and visited they can be visited with new eyes you take a camera and phone logs of bonus but basically mindset going even though you can 't travel anywhere really knows yet although it is getting closer and so that 's that 's what I mean by that one of the things to do if you try find new places is to actually go and map Google Maps or Apple Maps and look for green bits basically open green areas which if which we 're very very lucky in Perth we 've got heaps of them using bigger places the brief picturesque and choose somewhere where you haven 't been before and just go out there and have a look try something different also in going on a website called trails waa which is one of the websites that we set up for the walking trails we helped create this and then you look on the Charles W a site for trails and hear me and when you do that you will find all these different trails that you basically we 're not of the foot existed then walked on and they almost always include areas interesting places go to you sir you can use this trails W a website guide to find new places and when you explore new places it 's amazing what you find even even the most weirdest places we were some time ago we were exploring a little area around the side streets around Scarborough and came across is basically a field of poppies it could have been anywhere it could have been in France these poppies were covering this vacant block was unbelievable and so obviously it was a great option take some photographs people photographs it and for a while they always lost in this field of poppies in same thing it was something we never knew existed because we had this sort of explored our area we discovered a new place just a couple techniques we 're running out of time we don 't got 15 minutes to do this and one of the good techniques we use all the time in parks is not to spend in one spot and take a photograph and study angle but the move around take shots looking upwards like this photograph up into this tree with the beautiful lights created by that so you 're more interesting by doing that you 're actually exploring are you actually seeing more the other thing we do often play with this big depth of field so just a quick bit about did we get the field is simply sharp the foreground sharp middle ground sharp at ground so there 's a landscapes favorite tool basically you get its beautiful depth feeling in your photographs misses just a bit of a teaser do you show you what will be soon like we 're gonna travel in camp anywhere we like at the man we cut now that what I 'm showing shown here is the the way the the lines of the same jeans or the sand goes towards the our camping setup creating a bit of depth so this is a very good thing to work with if you just use your wide-angle lens on your camera you will find that you 've got natural depth of field we get the field so you get a lot in focus I wondering about detail it 's enough time I forgot some textures getting close just explore some explore new and get photographs of textures and things that normally would be not even noticed in real life fantastic things to photograph and get you sorted out the space of being expressed and there 's a classic sort of a tree stump showing talk about includes patterns are everywhere and they 're fascinating things do to chase down in photograph text to see shadows coming all forms and leaf matter especially in autumn is a great place hi Pat 's back place list we can all the leaves are line in the ground and you get create patterns and all sorts of things in your photography it makes it 's very interesting so do that and also about getting in close you get to compose your photographs and get some really strong images just by not just a wide shot sort of time but getting in close like this back shot and also Maggie gala morning now I 'm talking about half now before sunrise half an hour after sunrise sunrise I think it 's a great time to be in parks because there 's easy bit of mist around and so you get some beautiful interesting light coming through it 's soft and like this back light coming through it creates is really a serial type images but beautifully on leaves and trees and parks next sort of thing we can get that kind translucent sort of beautiful life basically so early mornings are great so for this kind pataga because you know in the but I love early mornings in parks in particular and I think notice about do it we will I 'll be going talking about another subject in this part of our series about travel mindset at home and for now we 'll leave it _"

    "text": "hello everybody my name 's Mike for Lucy you may know me from previous workshops I 've taught a lot of photography workshops in the gym lot library system and we are living in interesting times that way now let 's face it we can 't do these talks normally so now we 're learning them online and I don 't talk to you about a particular area of photography travel photography but not as we normally know it a lot of you I know love travel and are missing in traveling traveling but there is a way of doing your traveling in your own backyard or your neighborhood or your city and then talk to you about how I go about this form of traveling in your own backyard it is really difficult covered 19 times now I 'm gonna talk only 15 minutes long and I 'm gonna be talking to you about very subject so the first subject me to talk about is water now what we 're lucky in Perth we need for no area where there 's clean water around and water in any form to get out there and using your travel mindset walk around take photographs of water in its forms and then talk to you about that must get on to cuz it ain 't got 15 minutes but first a little bit about me because some people viewing this may not know me at all I 'm a photographer and writer and with my wife Jane where the business photography business among other things and I 've been a photographer since the 80s 1980s there 's a newspaper photographer and then freelance magazine photographer and freelance writer and photographer and lots of articles we 've done over 80 books so referral of experience and right now as we said we are going through interesting times and so I 'm going to show you a way of traveling in your own backyard with your camera okay introduction travel mindset at home that 's from talking about travel mindset is basically the mindset you had when you actually are traveling you have got more house I 'll put it a little bit braver you do things you wouldn 't normally do at home at home you explore new areas and you have this curiosity and what we trying to do here is why why do we have to go away to have this curiosity in all this excitement why don 't we explore our home a local area after all we live in a world where we 're in tunnel vision all the time and busy in normal life work kids all your family stuff and it 's we 're bombarded by so what I 'm saying here is well why don 't we find time even it 's just on our own to go outside and look around our own neighborhoods I 've got two ways of doing this anyway I 'm gonna show you right now now we will have our familiar place as we go to for it for example we 'll walk our dog in the park and be the same place same time here be every day and while we 're doing that a in most of time we caught up their own thoughts about what we have to do today all the stress you might be under see not really in the moment you 're not really really in the park at all you just walking the dog it 's like a chore but what if you in these times where we 've got a bit more time some of us have got more time on our hands why not we get into a habit getting outside take the camera or phone visit your local park or area where water could be a lake river the ocean we 're very lucky in Perth we 've got all these options so go to these places thank you for meeting with but in different looking new eyes you 're looking it differently you have much intent on seeing the stuff you want to see actually looking hard which one do and see so let 's go and talk about that a little bit so we go to for me a place and when I say go go for me a place you don 't if you can 't take your phone long you click the phone or flight mode power distress that happens is having the phone to enlighten that kind of in turn the phone off and just use the phone as a camera so when you go to a place you familiar with you just look around and take deep breaths and you really just calm down you 've got to calm down that 's what it 's all about so you slow down and basically breathe when and that sounds a bit strange it does sound a bit weird breathe but what I 'm talking about here is a fact that we don 't breathe properly we don 't breathe deeply we 've shallow breath and we and because it 's this it 's a part of this idea of of discovering your own backyard is to get out there in the familiar place slow down stop breathing deeply look around expand your awareness taking everything as you see it and get out of that head of yours one way of doing that is do what we call awaken your senses because of our busy world and the stress caused by covert we probably get a bit in their heads too much and we all the it so visually you don 't see it but also where the senses are dulled so you 're getting out there part of this discovering what 's new and familiar places is to get out there end of breathe look around smell what the smells are listen to the birds touch things textures fill inside how good that feels have gratitude for being out there you got lucky you have these things on your doorstep and get out there and just awaken your senses cuz that 's really perfect if you do that if you just do that and nothing else you will you will find yourself much more relaxed state and if you 're into photography you will get better photographs because you 're out of your head now that 's for me in places I 'll suggest that going to familiar places is a great place to start you know well but it 's amazing how you don 't know those places well either because you are seeing it in your eyes now you 've got the time to do that so that 's one thing but travel discovering new places and that can be done in a several different ways when you discover like when you 're traveling you know that you 're gonna find you place you get quite excited you don 't see new things well it 's amazing how many things around the Perth area which we take for granted or myths or the open stop that there are lots of walk places where there 's water of course I mean you might go to the local dog beats why not try a different Beach you might go to a local lake why not try a different like or you might go down you might go down the river when I tried to curb the river so run same here 's you are exploring your backyard as if you 're traveling overseas it 's just like that it 's amazing how different things look when you go to a new place now easy ways you use Google Maps and and use them as a guide simple really look at the blue bits which the lakes and rivers and ocean on little Maps okay I and go to those places it 's a really good way of doing it it 's quite exciting and it gives you the truffle mindset you don 't have to be overseas to do that now the other way is travel waa it 's one of the websites that we help set up when we map trails that 's per their work but what I 'm showing you here is that walk trails are everywhere and usually walk trails in good places and I bet you have not been on a lot of the walk trails you may have familial trails in your area but Jim doesn 't a lot of other ones explore those walk trails they 're all the places they 're always in good places around lakes and water features so do that see that 's the way to get into it finding new places it 's an easy way of doing it yeah exploring any places can be simple as this we were housed in Hillary 's area and we can cost as little like it 's not your main roads that 's easily missed around and it was just a tiniest little lake in a park so it helped with a new place for us that 's what I mean by exploring new places there 's so many around so many options and one of the things you can do and with is to photograph reflections to me reflections are reflective they calm you down their reflections and a rippling like the abstract patterns the movement of the water it 's just pure serenity and I love capturing those in photographs so that 's something you can do too it 's a great calming effect and is unlimited possibilities taking photographs of reflections and reflections on the beach receding wave leaves patterns behind always reflecting the sky the clouds around sunset it 's a great time to get these sort shots so just get down to the beach and cameraphone take photographs like that look at the horizon position the horizon there 's more just in the foreground I have more foreground is more Jason background sky had more sky don 't split it in the middle this is just a tip don 't spit anything it 's a big pointless so this this is just a little tip another great way of getting into this kind of state of travel mindset and also slowing down and releasing stress is to use a slower some speed make sense so anything below 15th of a second you can create water movement but this is a little creek running and it 's a smooth sort of water movement that creates that kind of professional photographer landscape photographer type calendar look you see a lot in waterfalls and there 's a lot of fun you need a tripod to steady the camera you 're using very slow shutter speed and probably better to have a cloudy day because it won 't work so we 'll have brought some night he takes low exposure you do it play with it it takes time he issued speeds but have fun doing it it 's the keys all about fun it 's no stress here faster speed it 's exactly the opposite it 's in the fifteenth of a second using over a thousandth of a second this one shot was very fast shutter speed that freezes water drops in like they are standing still it 's amazing the effects you can get so fast shots be slow so speed great fun play with your shutter speeds and have fun of that around any water feature rule of thirds have been a couple simple techniques for looking at composition well thirds Chavez use all the time it 's nothing nothing to it really they make it sound like the big deal when they talk about it but really your main subjects not being the scent of the photos and the simpler photo it means nothing it 's sort of washy in the composition terms these two joggers running on the beach or running coming from the right side as I see it and they 've got space in front where they 're running into that 's a simple composition technique it 's called rule of thirds strong foreground another thing to look out for you want to make your first more interesting while you 're out there how about some point of interest in the foreground it just makes it a if you use that technique you should be able to get good photographs most of the time Matty Guerra light I 'm talking about the hour before sunrise and after sunrise so half an hour Sun before sunrise half an hour after sunrise sunset half an hour before sunset hopefully after sunset fantastic best light low angle it 's a really beautiful light work with it and the actual sunset itself of course oh it 's worth going down stopping down near the beach or somewhere where you can take photos of the sunset it 's the best way really reducing stress now curb it 19 times and then don 't neglect the nut dish of it the sunset is finished it 's gone it 's getting darker but it 's still beautiful color in the sky and things happen that just go home since of sunsets stay around for around time why not do it getting closer that 's the other big thing don 't just take the same sort of photograph all the time the same angle getting close get into the textures and the patterns on the water shot you can do and getting real close it 's not stuff around like shells and other things that washed up on the beach which they 're very tiny and all the significant and easiness to do that get in close getting to that kind of in the moment type of photography now we 'll stop the image I think we really have time the answer as I said it 's very short but there will be more these 50 minutes snippets and I will catch you next time on another subject catch you later _"

    "text": "hi everyone and welcome to this special video presentation on Instagram and Facebook stories with the city of Joondalup libraries I 'm Amanda Kendall and you might have seen me speak at a city of Joondalup library in the past and today we 're doing it on video now what 's an Instagram or Facebook story you might know about them already and if you don 't you 've seen them you just didn 't know what they where perhaps so they are the little stories they 're little circles on Instagram little rectangles on Facebook they 're right at the top of your feed and if you haven 't_''_36.4 played around with them yet I hope you 'll want to after this short presentation because they are lots of fun so let 's go today we 're going to cover what exactly is a story why might you use a story how to reply to a story how to make stories in Instagram and how to make stories in facebook they 're really similar but not exactly the same remember that Facebook owns Instagram so they are pretty similar that 's one of my stories on the right you can see there 's a location tag Kuala Lumpur Malaysia a hashtag relax and a fun little Jeff saying pool it 's actually moving if you could see it in video form that 's just one of many stories I have made over the years so what is it as I said a story is something you find in a circle across the top of Instagram or in Facebook often it 'll show up in a small rectangle they are really at the top of your feed snapchat actually started this whole idea by having content posts that you could make that would disappear and until then we hadn 't really had something quite like that so that 's the whole point of a story in a sense so it 's temporary it 'll disappear after 24 hours unless there 's an exception of course in Instagram you can put it into your highlight folder and then you can find it forever like the one I 've done on the left there it 's from a trip to Denmark and include lots of things in a story photo or video words and pictures and lots of tags and we 'll talk about it in a minute what exactly you can put on there people can reply to your story and you can add multiple stories a lot of people will put a few stories up at once now why might you use a story so instead of always posting in your main feed on Instagram or Facebook a story is often a bit more personal a bit more casual maybe includes multiple photos or multiple videos so it 's not kind of clogging up your feed where everyone sees it you know in a really big form but people can find it if they want to you might want to use one because it 's creative and it 's entertaining like it 's just really fun it can also be a great way to interact with people and you can if you want to you can choose to share only with certain people now if you are reading people 's stories this is an example on Instagram you might want really love about stories is people tend to get really engaged they tend to reply and have a really good conversation so you can see in this example on the Left down the bottom of the story you can see a box that says send message so you can just tap on that type into it and the message will go into the direct messages of the person and if they reply back the same thing it will show up in the direct messages in your Instagram account occasionally users of Instagram will have this message send facility turned off and you just can 't_''_227.23 so if that box is not there along the bottom that means you just unfortunately cannot send them a message occasionally people turn this off by accident so if it 's someone you know send them a message in some other way and ask them if that 's the case how do you make an Instagram story I have to say I 've taught lots of people how to do this over the years because I think it 's not exactly intuitive it takes a figure it out so let me go through step by step when you 're an Instagram tap on your profile photo so it 's on the top left there you can see in my picture if you haven 't posted any stories in the last 24 hours there 'll be a little blue cross on that picture as well the little blue plus sign if it 's the first time you 've made a story your phone and Instagram will probably ask you can we have access to your camera can we have access to your microphone so you 'll have to say yes to both of those before you can make a story so then you need kind of the basis for your story which is usually a photo or a video so you can either take a photo or take a video it 'll be kind of a a camera screen that comes up all right there was a button button in the bottom left where you can access your camera roll or your photo gallery to use something that you took earlier then the fun real fun on the top right to add some fun so you have to have taken a photo or a video or uploaded a photo or a video before these icons on the top right come up so working from left to right the first one is to download it if you want to save it to your phone the next one the smiley face with stars has some filters so you can play around with those if you 'd like to they 're pretty self-explanatory once you tap that button the next one with the square smiley face offers a whole lot more and I 'll go through them on the next slide because there 's lots of options there you can use the squiggly line to draw change the color and stuff and that AAA is how you can add text like I 've done on that example there on that story and you can change the font the size the color and the position so once you 've got that text open you can type into it and you can see the options to cycle through different fonts you it smaller or bigger and to move it around on your screen all right so I promised you what is in the square smiley face icon I wish it had a better name but that 's what it is so if you tap on that icon these are some of the possibilities that you get straight away during coronavirus time you 'll see that there 's a couple of icons at the top stay home and thank you and those stickers that you can add to your post but generally speaking the first one is usually location then mentioned hashtag and so on so location obviously you can show where the photo was taken if you tap on that location button it 'll add that add a tag to your to your story and ask you to choose where you are so you can either choose a place you are now Instagram will look around and see what 's nearby or you can just type in for example Eiffel Tower and it will find Eiffel Tower and tag that as a location that means that other people who are looking so that 's something that you want might want to do if you use the app mention tag well that tags another Instagram user so for example if you 're tagging a photo of a friend you might want to tag them or a cafe or restaurant hashtag is you know to give a topic for your story juice is lots of fun going there there 's lots of fun moving pictures I love to put you know those little kind of fun moving emojis on because it just adds a bit of you know dynamism and life to a photo lots of other options in there try things out like polls and questions they can make it really interactive with your friends or followers so when you 've had a play around with all of that like you can see I did in my um my sample one there then when you finally decided okay my story 's finished you can tap the bottom left part where it says your story and your story will be published on Instagram so it will be found by anyone who follows you line around it and it will be clear that you 've made a story and they can tap on that and look at it but you can also choose just to send to your close friends list or if you tap send to on the bottom right there then you can send your story just to whoever you particularly choose to it might be just to one friend once it is published you can also you also get the options to send it to Facebook because their story 's features are so similar you can actually just post it on Instagram and Facebook or you can save it to one of your highlights folders which can be kind of topics of different Instagram stories that you want to save for more than two for hours so once you know how to make an Instagram story how to make a Facebook story is pretty easy too so you can see there on my Facebook profile on the right there right at the top of the newsfeed there 's this option here create a story if sometimes we 'll say add to your Facebook feed and you can see other stories are next to it and similarly you can select to photo a video or you can take a new one just like in Instagram there are also very similar features compared to the Instagram stories so you can see on this shot there 's stickers text you can draw use effects and they have the square smiley face with similar options as well so don 't be afraid to tap around the worst-case scenario is you might accidentally publish something that 's there for 24 hours but you know if you can also delete that if you do that so just don 't be afraid to tap around and explore all of the fun features when you finish making your Facebook story you can just click on share to story that big blue button and it will be published in facebook there 's a few bonuses that you don 't get in Instagram at the step where you usually choose a photo instead of choosing a photo you can do things like text music a boomerang video you can post about poll so there 's a few extra options in facebook stories so I hope that I have given you a taste for the fun of Instagram and Facebook stories I have taught many people about these over the years and once they are confident in having a good play around and tap all the buttons they generally speaking have discovered that it is really something fun to do and it 's really fun to interact with other people 's stories as well so don 't be afraid play around tap the buttons there are always new things to find so instagrams often changing things up and adding or sometimes subtracting but mostly adding new features and new things so just feel free to tap around and you 'll find some fun and if you 're just practicing or concerned just share it with your close friends or even just create them and save them to your phone you don 't have to share them they can just be lots of fun but I would encourage you to get creative really enjoy some story fun and I hope that that inspires you to have a go _"

    "text": "hi everyone Amanda Kendall here to talk to you about Facebook groups and how we can have a whole lot of fun with using them you might know me from usually speaking in person at City of Joondalup library events but during these times we are doing things a bit differently so this is my presentation for you on having fun with Facebook groups in this talk we 're going to cover these topics so first of all how to Facebook groups work how to find a good Facebook group special features of Facebook groups I 'm going to give you some examples of some really fun or interesting or effective Facebook groups that I know and I 'm even going to talk about how to start your own Facebook group I have run mmm dozens of Facebook groups over the years I guess through my work with my clients through my podcast and you can see there on the right that 's my Facebook group for thoughtful travelers which I run for my podcast so having run a group with nearly a thousand members I 've had lots of my favorite places on the internet so I hope I could help you find some Facebook groups that you 'll feel the same way about so first of all how do Facebook groups work so they are a part of Facebook and a group is something you can join and it will either be public or private or hidden so if it 's public it means that when you find it on Facebook you can actually see all of the posts and activity inside the group if it 's private then you can just see some basic information about it and if it 's hidden you won 't be able to find it at all unless someone invites you or you have a specific link that someone has sent to you so that means they have lots of different uses now a group admin someone who runs the group can set rules in the group that 's a special feature that you can see usually pretty readily and of course it 's important to abide by the rules that means for example you might not be able to post anything lots of rules are pretty straightforward and make sure that a group runs in a really you know friendly and useful way generally you need to request to join the group there 'll be a button once you find it and be approved by the admin to do that you might need to answer some questions so the admins of a Facebook group can set up a series of questions usually these are to check that you 're a genuine person who 's the right fit for the group and not someone who 's going to come in and cause trouble now Facebook groups are a bit different to a personal profile or to a business page so of course with a personal profile you know that 's when you can become friends with someone and both people have to agree a business page is where you can like the page and then you 'll see information from them and a Facebook group lies somewhere in between that so basically a Facebook group means usually you have to be accepted in to join it but they 're generally more open Facebook group they can work differently for example sometimes only the admins of the Facebook group can make posts in there and you can just interact comment or engage with those posts sometimes anyone can post at all whenever you like and sometimes there 's a middle ground and that means that you might want to post something in the group but it needs to be approved by an admin first that 's the way it works in my group so you can see a link on the left that 's been posted by a group member named Celeste and I received as an admin a notification that Celeste had tried to post in the group and I could see what she posted and therefore I could approve or not approve it in this case of course I approved it and so then that other group members got involved but anyone can start a Facebook group anyone who has already a Facebook profile personal profile and I 'll show you in the very last slide how to do that and of course you have the right to leave a group gives you notifications about it so Facebook groups often will have notifications and you can see you know your friend has made a post in this group or so on but you can adjust that within the group settings if you just go into the group each time into the main group and you can adjust the settings of how often you get notified about it so let 's say you are looking for a Facebook group to join how do you do it if you search in the Facebook search bar so this will work either on a mobile version of Facebook or on a desktop at at your computer just search in the tool bar now of that searching toolbar now what will come up it might be not all groups if you for example I 've posting about searching for the by nothing group there in the example on the right when I just put by nothing lots of information came up so then you need to search by groups only so you can see where I 've circled in green if you just tap on or groups with that name so you can search for a specific group name if you know it already if a friend has said all you should join this or if you 're just looking for a group on a particular topic say gardening then just type in gardening and Facebook will show you all a long list of groups about gardening the good thing is Facebook 's pretty clever and tries to suggest ones that are relevant to you so if you 're like me in Perth and you typed in gardening and went to groups you 'd probably be be shown some waa or Perth based gardening groups before you were shown other ones so it 's pretty handy like that it makes it much easier to find a group that you might like to join there are a few extra special features of Facebook groups that don 't happen in other parts of Facebook so your admins of a group can have special posts saved like at the top of a group called announcements that 's where they put all the really important information so that their group units so you might come across a group like that where you where they teaching new things and you can see the learning units in the group like me you know unit one you know some topic unit to another topic which can be great our group learners can run Facebook live events inside a group and that 's the example I 've got on the left there I run a book club chat every month in my travelers group and that 's a online Facebook live event that happens inside the group and groups can even host watch parties to watch videos together so if you 're showing a particular video you can start it as a watch party and that means other group members will be notified that and you can watch it together and make comments on it together so there are heaps of really interesting Facebook groups out there I wanted to give a few examples that might be interesting so some of the kind of local community kind of groups that I 'm a member of and really enjoy the by nothing groups are fabulous 're very small geographic areas for example I 'm in Don Craig and there are three or now four I 'm not sure at least three done Craig by noting groups but for specific parts like north east or northwest and so on so they have a specific area and by nothing is when you want to you know kind of trade something with your neighbors have something to give away you can see the Pope the example post on the right there a desk that needs a new home a free shared if you 'll remove it and you can also post firt you know things you need does anyone have any XYZ I 've had lots of fun with my by nothing group over the years and I highly recommend them they run really well and there 's also similar groups like pay it forward groups in my areas also a neighborhood watch group which is kind of interesting to keep in touch with people in your area and just kind of know some local things that are going on now there 's also lots and lots and special interest is there will be multiple groups that you can try out and you 're bound to find one that suits you so for example for travelers my group I I am particularly like that of course I do a W a gardeners group I mean is particularly good and it 's nice to have you know more localized information crochet in Australia that 's one of my hidden passions and there 's always always really interesting posts in there so whatever it is you can find it there 's also really interesting global groups so during this pandemic time you may have already come across or being invited to the group that that 's called view from my window I 've been really impressed with it 's a really well run Facebook group where the admins approved posts in a really sensible way so it 's lots of variety and it is as simple as it sounds it 's basically while people have been in lockdown or isolation it 's the view from their window but every day they 'll be posts from all different places around the well done so I 've enjoyed that group and this group set up purely for fun I have a two cats here and I have sometimes dipped into the funny cats group they have a thousand posts today so if you only cheering up go into that group so let 's say you want to start your own Facebook group there 's lots of reasons you might want to want to do that it might be for a community group you work with it might be for a group of friends and you particularly want you know to have a connection like this might be you know for a business you run or lots and lots of different reasons it 's easy to do so you 're just going to create in the app it 's just under the groups part or on the desktop of version of Facebook it 's just in the top right you can see create and that 's where you can create anything like a page or a group so you go to create group it asks you some basic things like putting in a on some rules and it has some kind of default rules if you want to use or adapt them it asks you if you want to set questions to screen your potential members which I think generally is a good idea and they don 't have to be you know difficult questions but for example if you 're the gardening W a group might have a question like you know whereabouts do you live so they can kind of ascertain that you are in W a just to make sure you know if people are really just trying to be kind of spammy coming you know dump annoying information in a group then they probably won 't take the time to answer any questions so it 's one good way to weed out people before they cause any problems and once you 've set up your group you can invite people easily you can invite your friends you can you 'll have a link for the group and you can promote your group anywhere you want and of course Facebook will always suggest groups to people who it thinks might result so that 's how you can start up your own group they can be a lot of fun and really rewarding to run so go and have fun with Facebook groups just to you know you reminder tips make sure you answer any questions when you request to join if you don 't answer the questions then mostly that admin won 't let you in and you 'll forget check and follow the group rules you don 't want to be banned from a group for breaking the rules and of course if you don 't enjoy a group you can just leave it as well so I hope that this has given you some ideas and in inspiration to go out and enjoy Facebook groups because I 've had lots of fun with them over the years and I 'm sure you can too _"

    "text": "hi everyone I 'm Amanda Kendall and today we 're talking about exploring Pinterest you might have seen me speak at a city of Joondalup library in the past and at the moment we 're doing things a little bit differently online and have a series of videos about some social media topics and today 's one is Pinterest so if you have been wondering about what Pinterest is you are in the right place to learn more today we 're going to cover what exactly is Pinterest why you might want to use Pinterest how to find some interesting pins how to save and organize your pins how to add your own pins and how businesses might use pins as well now there 's two ways to use Pinterest you can either go to their website at Pinterest calm it 's like interest with a pea on the front Pinterest calm or you can use their app on a mobile phone or a tablet so they work in really similar ways they 're just a little bit different and in today 's presentation I 've used screenshots from both so you can see how they look so you can see there on the right that is an example from Pinterest from the app in fact and of course right now during coronavirus times apparently making sourdough is really in so I thought well let 's have a look and you can see they 're a couple of pins about how to make a sourdough starter and that 's the beauty of Pinterest is that having seen those pins you could tap on those or click on them on a desktop and they would take you through to some more information typically to a blog post or a website that talks about it so that 's one of the best ways to find information using Pinterest so let 's get on to what exactly is Pinterest I like to think of it as a virtual peanut board where you can collect ideas and information so you might have in the past or maybe still do I 'm still doing parts of my office here behind me you might have a peanut board where you save things you might have you some a ticket or information or something like that that you pin up to a board and that 's basically the premise behind Pinterest virtual peanut board and you can have multiple boards this is the great thing that you can to have boards for different topics so if you think of it also as a visual google so when you need information or ideas you might go to google and google something but you can equally for lots of great topics go into the Pinterest site so either at Pinterest com or using the Pinterest app and search for anything that you want and find pins on that topic of pins might be pictures or they might be pictures with links through to articles or blog posts so people add links and images from around the internet on to Pinterest and that 's how you find them and if you want to keep them then you can save them on to your different boards and we 'll talk about boards in a minute and as I mentioned you can use this on a desktop or a mobile device or free thing you can set up to have a login to Pinterest it 's for free then whether you use it on a desktop or mobile you can alternate between if you like so there will be times I 'll be sitting at my computer looking up the stuff on Pinterest and later I might be in front of the TV and just having a little scroll around in Pinterest on my phone during an ad break for example so why do you want to use Pinterest why might you spend time on this well there are lots and lots of things you can do there so researching for example researching a trip that is my number one reason to use Pinterest I 'm a travel blogger remember and a travelpod Kaster so I love to travel and I have lots of boards with ideas for trips for the future and when I 'm researching a trip I can go crazy on Pinterest find lots of information and pin all of those bits of information to one board maybe you know planning a trip to Hong Kong board research for be another thing that you want to research or a home renovation you might just be looking for inspiration you might be looking for okay I mean I need to make want to make a cake or want to make something craft that kind of thing is there 's so much on Pinterest people from those kind of niches have been using Pinterest really wide widely for a long time so you can see there on the right and example of just searching for a train birthday cake and lots and lots of pins there so it might be that you just really want to see the pictures and save them to give you some inspiration or it might be that you want the information behind them people often use it just to keep collections of things together as well so for example if you make a vision board and you 're thinking you know these are the things I 'm dreaming about in my future or a mood board so you know I want to make a renovation or you know whatever sort of plan my wedding and I start collecting things that are give the right kind of aesthetics and you might just thoroughly enjoy browsing through Pinterest for fun and relaxation but a couple of examples of the kinds of things you might find so this is a board that somebody made on planning their trip to Italy it 's not mine I must say but this is the kind of typical thing that a typical Pinterest user will do they found you know things that they might want to try they found information you can see there in the top right traveling as a celiac to find some gluten-free food in Italy Florence at night so pre you know places to visit so basically you know lots and lots of pictures and information to help them plan their trip to Italy this is the you know I need some information so recipe for chocolate brownies is what I searched for and look what I found there 's so many of course the problem is which one do you want I don 't know but actually quite attracted to the best Easi fudgy chocolate brownies because well so there must be cooked so you can get you can definitely plan every meal you ever make ever again just by using Pinterest and if I click through onto those pins onto one of those pins if I click through it will open up a page that will show me the recipe on a website somewhere and I also mentioned doing it for vision boards or something like that so this is somebody 's vision board I found rather than you know some people will make a physical vision board with you know cutout magazines and things but Pinterest is a great place to make a vision board as well so how do you find these interesting pins there 's lots and lots of ways mostly you can search for either pins or boards you can see there on the right on an example of mr. doing a bit of dog hunting looking at Kaboodle 's and I sorted that so I could look by boards so I could find you know some interesting boards at all feature though is pretty cute dogs equally I could have just search their search without doing anything else I 'll just get lots of individual pins about them now if you don 't find what you 're looking for then just use more detailed keywords it 's you know very similar to using Google and Pinterest is pretty good at figuring out what you want if you for example click through to say I click through that very first board of on the example there of Kaboodle 's from jane and i might find that there 's lots of things in her in her profile that i want to look more deeply at maybe she has you know some other comparison boards with other similar kinds of dogs that I want to look at so I can just keep clicking around so my wanting is don 't get lost forever it 's easy to do it can be that you just keep finding new things and saving things and but you know if you 've got time to do that then go for it it can be a lot of fun and definitely inspiring so once you find these pins what are sure you can save them so you can save them by clicking or tapping on the red Save button once you 're in there you 'll see it and you can create any number nearly any number of boards so that you can save each pin into a certain board they say on Pinterest these days you can have up to 2,000 boards I think that 's more than enough I have maybe 30 and I think 2,000 is crazy oh it used to be a max of 500 it 's recently become 2,000 so anyway you can create boards you know might be you know dinner recipes or garden ideas or a bathroom renovation or trip to Italy or whatever and you can save pins into those board now if you want to you can actually also create sections within your boards so they 're like sub boards if you want to so maybe you 're planning a 40th birthday party and that 's the board you know planning our 40th and then you might have sections like you know cake ideas music ideas decoration ideas or something like of administration with Pinterest you can actually merge boards if you want to later on now what about if you want to add your own pin like maybe so that other people might come across it or just because you want to keep it in a collection so you can create your own pin by using there 's a plus sign so in the desktop version of Pinterest it 's red if you 're in the app version it 's gray but once you do that you 'll get to this create a pin section you can add a photo or a link write a description and choose a board that you want to now if you are often browsing on the Internet in general and you want to start saving things into collections then you can add a Pinterest browser button to your internet browser and if you just Google Pinterest browser button then what will come up will be some instructions from Pinterest so typically you just have to download a little little app which will put a Pinterest P into your browser and then when you 're hit P and it will then come up with a Pinterest box and say you know which board do you want to save this to and so on so nice and easy now here 's an interesting thing that a lot of users of Pinterest probably haven 't thought about is that Pinterest is also used extensively by businesses in a few different ways now you probably the one you probably realize if you 've used Pinterest at all is Pinterest advertising so you can see here in that example on the left that screenshot that the the top right image with the rainbow earrings just underneath it it says promoted by so that 's what they call a promoted pin that 's part of Pinterest advertising so these appear throughout your feed they 're always labeled as promoted they 're usually fairly relevant so that 's so they 're not too annoying and the more you search on Pinterest in general the more Pinterest gets to know you know what your interests are and it can provide you with you know useful kind of ads or relevant ads at promoted so that 's one way that businesses use it especially if you 're selling products and the kind of products that people are going to be searching for in Pinterest then that can be a very effective advertising strategy now the way I use Pinterest at most is the second version here so it 's widely used to get traffic to a website remember I described it as like a visual Google and I have a travel blog and of course on my travel blogs lots of information about traveling to certain places and so people will be in Pinterest and they might find a pin from me about seven things to do in Copenhagen and they either might directly click through and then they come to my website or they might save it to a board say they 're planning a trip to Denmark and they might come back and have a look at it later but that 's kind of how it works for me as a blogger and for lots of other people who get who use Pinterest with the hope of getting traffic because it effectively I get lots and lots of visitors to my website from Pinterest and the final way that some businesses use Pinterest is to use the boards to kind of showcase some of their work or in a kind of almost mood board sense to help clients make some choices so for example a wedding planner might have a bunch of boards in there you know might some board might be you know floral options or decoration options or celebrant options or things like that and it can be really kind of fun and interactive way for people to figure out some of the things some of the choices that they want to make so that is my overview on Pinterest I encourage you deeply to go and have a play around in Pinterest if you haven 't used it before or hopefully you 've learned something new and there 's some new things you can try in Pinterest it 's a fascinating place I love it because it 's there 's always it 's always easy to find something really interesting or fun or inspirational is my second point you are about to dive into Pinterest then make sure you know you know what time you need to do something next make sure you don 't spend too long in there I don 't encourage that of course but otherwise do enjoy using Pinterest hopefully you discover some new and inspiring ideas and information so go and have some Pinterest fun Thanks _"

    "text": "hi everyone I 'm AM Amanda Kendall and we 're doing a series of talks for the city of Joondalup libraries on some social media topics usually you might be seeing me face to face in a Joondalup library but at the moment we 're doing some events online and today 's topic is about LinkedIn LinkedIn is a social media platform that is not just for job hunting it 's sometimes the kind of platform when I mentioned it to people they kind of groan because I think LinkedIn is boring but it really isn 't boring and it has changed a lot since it began so today we 're going to talk about a few things to cover LinkedIn and hopefully you might see that it 's not boring at all and you might even want to try it out a bit more so we 'll start by discussing what LinkedIn actually is why you might want to use LinkedIn how to fill out your LinkedIn profile effectively hey might make connections with other people on LinkedIn because that 's of course the social part of social media things on LinkedIn and also using LinkedIn groups which are also sometimes neglected so I promise by the end of this I hope you 'll be convinced to give LinkedIn the go for lots of different reasons not just for job hunting so what is it LinkedIn has actually been around since 2003 I mean that 's getting up to a couple of decades it 's kind of amazing it began certainly largely as an online CV or resume place and a job board and these parts still exist and they 're still a really important and useful reason to use LinkedIn but back in those early days it was really just a way of having a kind of a digital resume or a digital CV that you could share with people and that you could connect with people who might want to employ you but these days it 's evolved it is definitely not just about job hunting and now it 's a really kind of fully fledged social media platform with a professional kind of work focus so it 's in some ways really similar to a platform LinkedIn you can connect with people you know or people you want to know and you can send messages to each other you can also read articles or other posts from the people you 're connected to or from their connections and their networks and basically it is like Facebook this is what I always tell people it 's like Facebook but without funny cat videos so it 's you know often actually a more interesting place than Facebook because there 's not a lot of not so much fluff on there on LinkedIn and lots of really really interesting things if you 're connected to the right people so why might you use LinkedIn as I said it still is a place for job hunting that 's one of its many features these days so if you are looking for work LinkedIn is a really good way to do it and having an up-to-date profile on LinkedIn often means that you 'll be contacted by people who are maybe headhunting or looking for someone like you you can also find people for other purposes there so perhaps you need LinkedIn is a really good place to search for people for whatever needs you have it 's also a great place to connect with lots of like-minded people people who share your interests or share your professional background also a great place to be finding articles and posts of interests that especially if you have you know quite specialized areas of interest then following and connecting with people who share those interests is a really good way to make sure that you 're across you know the latest research or you know what what people are talking about in those areas today and I guess that brings me to that last point there LinkedIn is a great way to keep up to date so I find it a great place to keep up-to-date with my professional interests and making sure that you know I know what the kind of main thought-leaders I suppose are talking about and thinking about so if you are going to start your own start using LinkedIn you need to make sure that you have a good LinkedIn profile so that people want to connect with about so the important things for a good LinkedIn profile first of all the vision parts are pretty important you want to have a good profile photo that 's the bit in the circle on that example there and you want to have a good background cover photo you can see mine behind my face is actually three pictures joined I used canva to join them if you 've not used canva before have a look but it can be just one picture but you know as you can see it 's a long landscape picture and so that background cover photo should reflect something about you so that people can kind of you know get to know what you are just by that quick visual look also make sure that your profile photo is a good one and not you know cropped out from being at a party or something like that once you 've done that you also need to complete the main sections of your profile which are about so the top part experience which is kind of the you know the job experience resume part of profile has similar topics to a traditional resume but you might fill it out in a different way you might use the first person rather than the third person I typically do but not everybody does most people I think would talk about themselves in the first person though on LinkedIn and you can put some you know examples of the kinds of work you 've done you can even upload you know presentations or videos or images or PDFs so that you can kind of demonstrate the work you 've done if you go further down or LinkedIn profile there 's the skills and endorsements sections they 're not so used these days but you might see them come up and they might come back in the future who knows recommendations are still there too and recommendations are really important there like references or testimonials so the big part of the power of LinkedIn is making connections so how do you make those connections on LinkedIn there 's a few ways to find people and typically it 's easier to connect with them if they 're already connected to perhaps have an email address so you can first start just search for people you know by name so like that example in my screenshot there I search for Jane Smith and you can see that LinkedIn has found some Jane Smith 's who are second degree connections of mine that means that we have a connection in common already so LinkedIn assumes that this is more likely to be the Jane Smith 's that I 'm looking for and obviously if I picked a less common name it would be easier to find them you can also search by keywords so say you are looking for an expert like a social media manager or something or a topic of interest you might talk you might search for Wildlife Conservation and find people who work in that area you can also go and look through the list of the second degree or second and third degree connections of the people you know so you can go to someone 's profile and go and see their connections so that 's an also a good way to find people that might be sure to check with the people who have asked to connect with you have a look at the people who have asked to connect with you connect if you know them just be aware that some people will be kind of trying to connect in a spammy way so check in their profile and see you know do they look like someone who 's like-minded and interesting for me to connect with or are they just trying to sell me something and if they 're just trying to sell you something just click ignore so on LinkedIn you can write a post very similarly to the same the way you do on Facebook so you can see there this is from this screenshots from the mobile version looks really similar on desktop though you can add a photo or a video you can see there from those icons you can paste a link in from a newspaper article or a blog post or whatever that you 've read online and LinkedIn will populate it with a nice picture from that post and you can add your own comments about it like Facebook now as well as posting something of interest that way you can actually also write write an article which is what LinkedIn calls it it 's kind of like LinkedIn 's blogging platform so if you have something more substantial to say you know multiple paragraphs rather than just that you know relatively short post then you might want to use write an article when you 're on the desktop version and you go to post there 's a option there where it says write an article and you can click there and go and do it now the other interesting part of LinkedIn that some time 's neglect it is that LinkedIn includes groups so you might remember that there are Facebook groups as well and LinkedIn groups work in a similar kind of fashion and you can be invited to join them invite others and you can request to join a group so there there are groups for all kinds of topics probably any topic you imagine there is a LinkedIn group for it or multiple lived in groups for it so you can search for can also when you do that you can click on group so it will just search for groups so for example if you are looking for perhaps pers networking then type first networking and then click on the groups part and it will come up with a list of groups that are connected to that topic so that way you can find you 'll see you know how many members are in the group and you can request to join usually you need to request to join and and then you know once someone sees that request and you 're admitted to the group you can see more about what happens in the group some groups are really active and useful some aren 't you know sometimes it 's a bit hit and miss it 's a bit hard to tell in advance sometimes but once you 're in there you can have a look around if you don 't like it you can leave of course you can always leave a group but a lot of them you 'll find really useful really interesting and not necessarily used by feature that we can probably make more of so that is my summary of how you could make the most of LinkedIn making sure you have a great profile and that you 're connected to interesting people and perhaps making interesting posts yourself and of course can interact with those posts from other people as well and if you do that I think you could have a really interesting experience on LinkedIn find that lots of useful information and also you know make some great connections and you know friendships and professional relationships as well so that 's my summary as I say on the note there LinkedIn is fascinating these days don 't think Oh LinkedIn is boring definitely not boring anymore best part about it is connecting with like-minded people if you 're connecting with some who you don 't know you might want to put a note with the connection as you request to connect so that they know why you 're asking be active on LinkedIn so post your own things read things learn and react and above all have fun because LinkedIn these days is fun Thanks _"

    "text": "hello everyone and welcome to today 's special city of joondalup libraries online story time my name is ness and i 'm your librarian and i 'm going to read a special story with you today but first let 's sing our welcome song it 's story time sun shining it 's time for some fun it 's story time sunshiny welcome everyone all right so today is a very special story time because it is national simultaneous story time that means all across australia librarians teachers educators parents all sorts of people are reading the very same book at exactly the same time can you imagine how many children will be listening to this story at the same time there 's you maybe a hundred more a thousand more a million more certainly hope so see the point of national simultaneous story time is to get a million kids listening to the same story at the same time that 's what simultaneous means now simultaneous that is a great word now in this story i want you to listen for some other really good and interesting words that the grifford and the book we 're reading as you can see from the poster is whitney and brittany chicken divas let 's have a look at these chickens they look pretty fabulous don 't they they 've got very sparkly tiaras and jewelry glittery eyes they look very fabulous so i think i need to dress up a little bit to celebrate this book and look what i 've got oh my gosh this is great oh i feel fabulous and i feel very ready to read the story now all right whitney and britney chicken divas there we go let 's get started whitney and brittany are two gorgeous chooks fluffy and silky with stunning good looks they live with the elegant for dora von dos and from morning till night time the chickens just snooze [Music] wake up darling chickies says dora perplexed i want your sweet company not just your ex but whitney and brittany doze on counting sheep so what are they doing when dora is asleep at nine every night the chooks leap to their feet they hop over fences and flap down the street in says miss russell you 're on it half past on with the sequins tiara 's in bling the curtain goes up and the chooks start to sing wow look at that they look fabulous oh they got some bows like me what a performance the crowds in a fever it 's whitney and britney they 're great chicken divas [Applause] beautiful back in their yard with sore wings and tired legs the kind chicken divas leave dora two eggs blue one and a pink one morning says dora as she pops by the coop murder whitney and brittany are utterly pooped dozing again dora says with this eye then gleaming pink sequin catches her and what 's this pink bower and this sparkly ring and can that be glitter on whitney 's left wing dora is thinking tonight i will snoop so later that evening she peeks in the coop they 're gone i knew it thanks dora they 're out having fun i 'm getting my glad rags this night is still young it 's late at club sparkles and in the front row a secretive stranger is you also see who else is watching a dolphin in a waistcoat that 's ridiculous but whitney and brittany are taking the floor they wow and they dazzle the crowd claps for more such wonderful chokes cheers a stranger but who is the stranger the crowd turns to sea who is that it 's dora vondues the famous performer and whitney and brittany see their dear dora hooray they rush to embrace her sobbing with wonder and then being divas they sing a jazz number hurrah for the divas now dora still lives with her two gorgeous chooks fluffy and silky with stunning good looks and during the day they snooze and they rest but once the night falls they are foxy and the chickens look how fabulous they are wow that is great and look at them grooving away singing into their microphones what a great show that is so much fun now what were they doing on that last page can you remind me we just looked at it but yes you 're right they were singing into some microphones now no diva is complete without their instrument could do today a little bit later we can make a microphone like this but before we make our microphone i think we should sing another song i think we should sing a song first and it 's about chickens so i need to get your little hands ready your little chicken hands ready are you up are they all wiggling away all right let 's go chok choy good morning mrs hen how many chickens have you got madden i have ten four of them are yellow and four of them are brown and two of them are speckled red the finest in the town should we do it again all right so ten fingers up wiggling them away good morning mrs hen how many chickens have you got madam i have ten four of them are yellow four of them are brown two of them are speckled red the finest in the town now are you ready to make our microphone craft today no how cool is this you can make this with just some stuff at home now we 've got some instructions for you and all a cardboard tube some coloured paper perfectly black some scrap paper elf oil then some scissors glue and sticky tape so i 'll show you how to make some of the trickier bits although it 's not very tricky at all so i 've got my toilet roll and what i 've done just to make the microphone a better shape to hold is just cut down there and if you can see you just squeeze it together a bit just to make it a little bit tighter so it fits in your hand nicely so you can make it however wide you want get it a good shape for your hand because you 're going to be singing into it a lot a bit and then i 'm going to get my sticky tape up here there it is and sticky tape it together now the next step that you want to do is get some do you have black paper at home if you do you can wrap black paper around it like the instructions say or a different color paper whatever color you want maybe you can sparkly and then that 's your microphone base now if you wanted to make the ball of the microphone using only alfoil you would have to use a lot of alfoil so what we 're going to do instead is get a scrunched up piece of paper just some scrap paper and then get a square of alfoil that 's probably how much you need that 's not very much much less than you would use if you had to do all foil so you can be very clever and look how scrunch it out together and then kind of make it like a little ice cream shape can you see that and stick it in there and we just get our sticky tape it doesn 't need to be very perfect sticky tape it on if you 've got clear sticky tape that 's really good there we go look at it so obviously you 've got a nice colored base if you 've got a different color strip of paper you can make it around there and get some buttons maybe you 've got some glitter and you instrument as well maybe you 've got a tissue box and you can make a drum maybe you 've got two sticks or two pencils and you can tap them together to keep the beat maybe you have another long cardboard tube and you can poke holes in it and make a trumpet think about what instruments you can make and along with your microphone you can start your very own band at home hooray that will be so fun all right i 'll leave you thinking about what sort of microphone you can make but i just wanted to remind you about the book that we read today for national simultaneous story time and all of the fun and interesting words do you remember some of the nice words that we heard in this book words like diva gorgeous perplexed elegant and secretive so those are beautiful words great words and reading books introduces children to words that they might not have heard before in everyday conversation so that 's why the more books the better because we know that knowing more words helps children learn to read when all the time we have for today i 'm gonna leave you this time but i will see you again and we 'll sing our little goodbye song for now so now our time is done we 've had a lot of fun we 've sung a lot of rhymes and songs goodbye to everyone we wave goodbye like this we wave goodbye like this we clap our hands for all our friends we wave goodbye like this all right bye and thanks for listening to our national simultaneous storytime book whitney and brittany chicken deeders did we get a million kids listening i really hope so all right see ya bye _"

    "text": "hi welcome to a city of Joondalup library storytime online my name is Nessa and I 'm your librarian today and I 'm really excited to be sharing a story with you today today we 're going to be celebrating Earth Day which was on the 22nd of April this year so I thought I 'd read your book all about planet Earth and how we can take care of it and I 'll show you a fun earth craft activity at the end but before we get started we 'll sing our first song sing along with me it 's storytime sun shining it 's time for some fun it 's storytime sunshiny welcome everyone all right sorry the book I 'm reading today is all right by one of my favorite authors it 's the earth book by Todd PHA I loved hard PI 's books because they 're always so bright and colorful and loved his pictures let 's get started I love the earth because I know that I can do little things every day to make a big difference I used both sides of the I love the treaties and I want the owls to have a place to live there 's a little owl family we got a daddy Elle and a mummy air and a little baby owl other animals live in trees there 's lots of birds and possums and squirrels and lots and lots of different insects so trees are pretty important oh I turn off the faucet when I brush my teeth now faucet that word is another word for tap so there you go you learnt a new word now I turn off the faucet when I brush my teeth and I use less water for my baths because I love the fish and I want the oceans to stay blue the happy fish there do not a group of fish is called it 's called a school of fish yeah they all are oh and there 's some children playing on the beach they 've made a sandcastle that 's fun I take the school bus and I ride my bike because can you see who 's riding a school bus and elephant do you go to school be pretty fun though I love the Stars and I want the air to be clear so I can see them Sparkle do you go out at night sometimes watch the stars sparkling in the sky my favorite oh and look at all the little fireflies that 's nice I try to eat every bite on my plate and I save my leftovers the curse I love watching things grow and I want there to be enough food for everyone I 've got a nice little veggie garden there they 've got all sorts of things some carrots some mushrooms some lettuce too little bunny rabbits I remember to turn off the lights and shut the refrigerator to save energy because I love the polar bears and I want a snowman to stay cool look at that nice polar bear family while giving each other a cuddle I think a polar bear would give a nice big fluffy cuddle don 't you I throw garbage in the trash can and I recycle glass aluminum paper and plastic because I love to walk barefoot in the grass and I don 't unhappy to be moving to Mars I think I 'd be pretty fun to go visit Mars but I wouldn 't want to live there be pretty boring there 's not much to do most of all I help take care of the earth the curse I want all of us to be happy and healthy but a lovely scene that is look at all the animals and all the people all sorts of people a nice sunny day in the park a nice oh look todd has given us ten things we can do to help that earth so let 's go through them so number one we can turn off the lights number two recycle number three save my leftovers number four be nice to the worms very important number five share a book we 've done that today well done six is plant a tree seven is used both sides of the paper eight is save water nine is clean up trash and ten it put my underwear in the freezer when it 's hot well that 's very strange I didn 't know that could help you say so now look he 's got one last message for us at the end of the book every one of us can help protect the earth and make it feel good remember if we take care of it it will take care of us so I hope you like that book like I said I loved it so much because the pictures are so bright and colorful and exciting now as I was saying one of my favorite things to do is go out at night time and look up at the beautiful stars in our sky so I thought we could sing twinkle twinkle little star together you can get your twinkly stars ready twinkle twinkle little star how I wonder what you are up above the world so high like a diamond in the sky twinkle twinkle little star how I wonder what you are hey well done beautiful singing there now another thing I really like about the earth a little fishies swimming in the sea so I thought we could sing all the fish swimming in the water so if you make your hair along with me all the fish are swimming in the water swimming in the water swimming in the water all the fish are swimming in the water bubble bubble bubble bubble pop there 's some fun songs about the earth now I promised you a good craft that we can make together to celebrate Earth Day so just get it od not something over but that 's fine so what we 're gonna make today is a beautiful earth mobile I 'll can 't see that so we 've got the planet there and we 've got some little love hearts and on the love heart I 've done all of the things I love about the earth so I 've got some kitties and some beads and the fishies in the Seas and then on the back we 've got some things you can do to help look after the earth so things like picking up litter cycling and planting trees or other plants then nice and green so we 've got a template for you and some instructions so our instructions will be on the website and on can do to look after the planner and some hearts that are blank and then you can put some of your favorite things about the planet on it now in this template I 've got some string that I 'm hanging hanging my dangly hearts from but if you don 't have string at home that 's fine because what I 've got is another one to show you and I 've used paper see how it 's nice and curly so I 've got my extra strip of paper and to make it a bit more fun bit more bouncy I 'm gonna roll it around my finger squeeze us in tight and then it 's nice and springy and then using some glue which I 've got here I 'm gonna stick my hearts to it and then we stick the heart with the instructions of how to look after the earth on one side and then I 've got my little kid capital out on the other side and you can do whatever you want now we 're sticking it to our earth planet shape it 's strong and sturdy so I use the paper plate but if you don 't have a paper plate what other cardboard can use maybe you 've got a spare tissue box or maybe you 've got the cereal box you can use or a shoe box any bit of cardboard you find will be perfect so once you put all your daily hearts ready to get to the back with some glue and then you got to get the other side of the earth stick it to the back but before we glue our little earth together we do need something some way to hang it hang it off somewhere in your bedroom off the door somewhere pretty so if you don 't have any string again what I did I have some paper and I rolled it up nice and tight to make it strong and I folded it over and just stuck it get some sticky tape to make a little loop can you see this and that will be perfect for hanging up my little globe my little earth mobile so I 'm gonna just stick it in the back get the other side of my earth stick it on and there we go it 's ready to hang up in my room a nice favorite spot where I can look at it and remember how much I love the earth what I 'm gonna do it look after it alright well I hope you have fun making that craft and thinking of all the nice things you can add to your decorations for it that 's all the time we 've got for today so we 're going to go but before we go I just wanted to remind you that in today 's story the earth book we learnt about what we can do to look after it so the story showed lots of activities and places that you 're going to recognize going to the shop brushing your teeth being in the garden so exploring the world around you with your child and talking about the places you go and the activities in the book you 're developing they 're curious nature young children learn best and understand from what they can see touch world and develop those important scientific skills by asking lots of questions and showing them lots of different experiences you can do that through books which is really great alright so our last song today and then we 'll see you next time I hope you sing along with me and now our time is done we 've had a lot of fun we 've sung a lot of rhymes and songs good bye to everyone we waved goodbye like this we waved goodbye like this we clap our hands for all our friends we rang goodbye like this bye I 'll see you again bye _"

another story and the next story I 'm gonna sing to you read to you today is called Gary 's banana drama and it 's by Jane Macey so let 's see what happens to Gary look lots and lots of bananas in this story okay here we go this is Gary Gary loves bananas but one day something bad happened something really bad what could that be there were no more bananas oh no poor Gary any other gorillas might have panicked but not Gary he had a plan he put on his brand new hat and he trimmed his toenails snip snip snip snip and then he set off to look for more bananas it was an excellent plan still Gary was very surprised to stumble across some bananas after only 1 2 3 a minute bananas don 't go woof hmm that 's a bit strange we better turn the page and see what happens then it jumped up and licked Gary all over his face haha that 's when he realized they weren 't bananas at all they were dogs yeah but as Gary wiped away the dog drool he heard an unusual sound some right and fine looking bananas was singing a beautiful song hmm Gary knew the tune so you joined in he was just about to take a really big bite when they weren 't bananas at all they were yellow beaks and there were quite a lot of them and then one of them picked Gary on the ear ouch but there was no time to feel cross because lots and lots of bananas were now rocketing towards him they went bananas either they were boomerangs yeah said Billy perhaps really needed a little bit more practice in throwing his boomerangs poor Gary he was going completely bananas he could see bananas everywhere and he couldn 't eat any of them it was the worst day ever and about to make his way home when he bumped into what looks like a really big banana head Gary found the best banana of all hmm what do you think it 's very big and very yellow it looks super yummy I think it might be shall we see no it was a giant space rocket not a banana at all but Gary didn 't want to rock it he wanted a banana poor Gary then Gary saw it high up into the sky in the dusky sky surrounded by twinkling stars what 's the most wonderful thing can you see it can you see there 's a beautiful glowing banana right up in the sky Gary lept into the rocket five four three two one blast-off hm and he zoomed into the darkness and after many many hungry hours Gary landed on Gary was finally full of bananas YUM oh good job Gary but maybe it was time for him to try something new after all Gary had always liked grapes can you see all the little aliens in my picture there 's lots of little green aliens in out aliens bye Gary and that 's the end of the story that 's one of my favorite stories because it lets me make lots of silly noises and gets you to use your imagination and both the stories I read to you today had lots of sounds in them we made lots and lots of animal sounds so maybe you would like to try and find a story that you could read with mum or dad today that has animal sounds into and you can make the animal sounds together that sounds like a great idea so at the end of my story Gary flew up in his rocket ship into space and there were lots and lots of twinkling stars so how about we seen twinkle twinkle little star are we ready have you got your twinkle fingers ready here we go twinkle twinkle little star how I wonder what you are up above the world so high like a diamond in the sky twinkle twinkle little star how I wonder what you are good job everybody give yourselves a clap well done so that 's all we I 'd like to suggest that you go on a treasure hunt I 'm gonna go on a treasure hunt in your backyard or perhaps you could go on a walk with mom or dad around your neighborhood and see if you can find five animals let 's count we ready one two three four five so you know look for five animals in your garden or out on your walk and maybe you might find a butterfly or a little bird or perhaps even a little wriggly worm or maybe a snail so have lots of fun searching and now it 's time for us to see

story shout hooray hey if you 're ready for a story and you 're ready for a story if you 're ready for a story shot all right already how fantastic all right so like I said for Mother 's Day we 're reading a special book about all the good work jobs that moms do so this book is called great job mum and it is by home and length and if you look very carefully at the pictures you will notice something really cool I 'll see what how the pictures were made at the end all right here we go my mum works as a carpenter she builds things being strong at night though she 's a general and she marches troops along right after bed doggy kitty you too she 's also a part-time curator with a passion for the Arts oh look at that fridge did your fridge look like that with all of your beautiful which one to put up that she knows and a frequent archaeologist in search of buried parts whoa where are the matching socks mom we 'll find him don 't worry she 's very much a scientist there 's data year by year she 's measuring how tall he 's grown do you have a wall maybe where you mark how much you throw each year at your house and a Secret Service agent too who follows very near ah he 's doing some daring things bouncing on the wall but mum 's right they have a high team special body guide just to look last baby on most days she 's a journalist on top of breaking news but your mom takes lots of pictures of you but sometimes she 's a zookeeper who handles beastly crews oh my gosh look at what that doggies done and also kitties up there getting up to me stiff and the kids are being a little bit naughty too she serves as a doctor now and then when patients must be nursed there 's nothing like your mum looking after you and active flair without a line rehearsed Oh what 's happened to ya ah I think she 's being a pirate she thinks so she 's got a hat and I think that 's a sword and let 's see ah telescope what a clever mum using her imagination there and DJ is the late-night geek she never tires of their having a groove and a scene to some songs mum does one job for her career the others out of love that 's nice now said we 'll see how these pictures are done so this man who made this book made all of these dollies and then he posed them in spot for each page and took a photo of it and he made all the tiny tiny little things in it as well so remember when she was being a pirate that 's what that looked like and over here and she 's building a go-kart so that it 's very clever all of the work that went into that book and all of the work that your mom does too so I thought that was a perfect sing a song at that I think a very famous mother that you know and that is mother duck and her five little ducklings so tracing that together five little ducks went out one day over here and far away mother duck said quack quack quack quack but only four little ducks came back four little ducks went out one day over the hills and far away mother duck said quack quack quack quack but only three little ducks came back three little ducks went out one day over the hills and far away mother duck said quack quack quack quack but only two little ducks came back two little ducks went out one day over the hills and far away mother duck said quack quack quack quack but only one little duck came back oh no one little duck went out one day over the hills and far away mother duck said quack quack quack quack and all of her five little ducks came back kisses for all the duckies how is nice I love that song it 's one of my favorite songs to sing all the little make your mum a card so what we 've got is a special card that you can make for her and we 've got instructions here that you 'll be able to find them for them to make exactly the perfect card for lunch and this is what it will look like so as you can see you 've got a little teacup on the card and a little tea bag in there and then inside you can write your message to them so the instructions are very good for you to follow to make this card but I 'll just show you some of the trickier bits with the egg carton all right so you need an egg carton and I 've got one here that 's already cut up how it needs to be and I 'll show you where your time so at the very top you cut off the top to it cotton it cut it and then you cut one away from that so this one is what we 're going to end up using see the shape of it see how it 's nice will look like that first but then you just have to cut around the top cut around the sides and then from there and make it nice and smooth so it looks like that you see you 'll see how to do it exactly on the instructions but I trust you I think you 've got it I think you know what to do so then we 've got our card and we 're gonna stick it cut teacup on our card like that now for our one we used a glue gun first if you don 't have a glue gun there 's sticky tape is absolutely fine but before we put the sticky tape on which is viola sticky tape which is over here now if you don 't have a little pipe cleaner to use you can just draw with a little handle when it comes up you can see how fast you can take me my egg cup on there and I get some more sticky tape just to finish it oh you guys can you see what then what you do is so you can a pipe cleaner to make the handle and you can decorate it with flowers or love hearts of birdies or whatever your mum likes and inside you write a message and there 's one more thing you need to do for your teacher isn 't there that 's right you get your bit of tea you put it in and it 's all ready to give to her she will love it so I have fun making that one for her alright it 's time to go now sadly that will sing aren 't very fine or goodbye some niches open chapter and we 'll see

    "text": "great good afternoon ladies and gentlemen and welcome my name is mushy Chad rearm the economic development lead at the city of Joondalup and I 'm so delighted to see many of you here tuning in to our inaugural Q&A webinar with the Small Business Development Corporation 's first and foremostly the area surrounding like julep was and continues to be a very important place from the morning about people and I 'd like to acknowledge the traditional people what are people of the new nation well the traditional owners and the land where our businesses are located before I introduce you to the lovely Lauren and Lisa I 'd like to share some of the key programs that we 're doing at the city of Joondalup in particular we 've covered heating which is the biggest topic right now in our lives as a global pandemic there 's been an enormous impact on our local economy and in particular a lot of our businesses have experienced a hit to their revenue and their customer base the city we 're committed to helping the small business community to emerge stronger our programs and initiatives to support the cause one of these programs which I really encourage many of our local businesses to participate in is the business engagement program through this program the city 's dedicated economic development team are providing the guidance and support to businesses who are navigating the impacts of the restrictions the social distancing Medan measures and the broader financial impacts of go feed we 've already engaged with more than a hundred businesses in the last few weeks and connected them to the state federal government initiatives such as what the Small Business Development Corporation is putting out what are the industry is putting out the Australian Taxation Office services Australia in the Department of Health as a small business friendly City juleps worked closely with the Small Business Development Corporation for many years and thanks to our strong relationship with Lauren Westcott and Lisa ladina with who have kindly agreed to support us and our business community today in participating in this Q&A Lauren is a senior policy and advocacy officer who 's been instrumental in the statewide local government small business friendly program we 've had many discussions about this Lauren and fast approval processes for small businesses in her role as manager advisory services and then we also have Lisa hi Lisa who 's been extremely busy and which is quite it 's been quite inspirational for a lot of our businesses to be devoted to these particular coronavirus helpline and you 've seen an amazing huge amount of calls and inquiries coming in from small businesses from EE I 'd like to say thank you to everyone who 's actually submitted a question already beforehand for the Q&A and we 'll try and get through as many as we can today if you 'd like to pose a question during the session please do so using the chat function and we 'll try and include them in our discussion before I hand over to Lauren and Lisa I just want to thank my team for putting this together we 've tried to be as responsive to the needs of the business and we are trying to reach out and bring we put together programs campaigns to help support you so Lisa sharing some of the key challenges the SBDC are seeing from businesses and as they navigate through the current pandemic initiate Thanks and thanks for setting up this Q&A today we really appreciate it and hi to everyone that 's dialed in from home so it has been a really challenging six to eight weeks and I don 't think any of us truly expect it or could have imagined the impact that it was going to have on our small business sector so as you mentioned we 've been doing our best to respond to these challenges so we quickly move to an digital service delivery models so we 've moved our workshops online we launched our pitch chat service we 've still got our wonderful team of business advisors who are responding to a lot of calls and we 've had about I think a three hundred and forty percent increase in visits to our website as well so we establish a dedicated web page where we could put all the updates related to the restrictions and the financial packages that are available because they 're changing daily seeing there 's quite a few different challenges that small business operators are faced with so I 'll run through some now I 've got about eight of the main ones that we really notice so firstly it 's been understanding the rules and restrictions that 's been a really big challenge and it 's been changing daily it 's been really confusing for business operators because some businesses have to shut entirely some businesses can still open some can open but have to do things a bit differently so that 's been a big challenge we 're really hopeful that now that we 've had seven days in a row maybe it 's eight of no coded cases that we might be getting an announcement tomorrow or over the weekend that the restrictions are going to be you know start to roll back so that 's really hopeful and will help a lot of businesses start planning forward another challenge we 've seen is businesses having to understand and apply for the financial assistance packages that 's been again really challenging and another challenge has been the lag time goes for the job keeper I 'm having to pay my workers but I don 't have money for that and you know payment hasn 't arrived yet so that 's been a big challenge for a lot of people another one has been pivoting with a service delivery model so thinking how on earth can I do that am I able to do that so that 's been a big challenge another one has been negotiating with landlords it 's a big one and a significant one and it 's mostly been about rent reductions so we 've had a lot of calls on that and none really sore will touch on that a bit later in the session because the government has announced some some things to try and try and address that another challenge which is the obvious one is the financial difficulties and business failure some businesses won 't get through this which is really unfortunate and you know horrible and heartbreaking and I 'm hoping that the majority will get through this but that 's the most significant challenge another one is for our regional with the border restrictions a lot of road houses are suffering and the added issue with that is you know our supply chain relies on these road houses operating so that 's something that the government is aware of and is it come to consulting with them on that in terms of tourism towns you know in our state we have a lot of towns that rely predominantly if not all on tourist dollars particularly in the north of our state where they have because of the weather they can only make their money in peak season which we 're heading into so if they can 't operate in the next three or four months they are faced with not making any money for the next 12 to 18 months and that 's a long time and that 's a big thing to think about will I be able to wait that amount of time before I can reopen again another one is employment obligations which we 're getting some calls about so and it 's quite obvious really here for a small business who 's never had to think can I legally stand my workers down can I can can I not do that what can I do as well as what do I have to pay my staff you know if I 'm if they 're on this wage now but they 're getting job keeper what do I have to pay them so they 're all really complex questions that businesses are being required to answer or find out elsewhere another challenge is supply issues so this is something that has been going on and will continue so whether their stock and suppliers are coming from down south over east or from China say there 's been delays or significant destructions and we 're we 're sorry that a number of suppliers have closed down too so that 's gonna have a big impact particularly when say the restaurants all reopen at the same time what 's that going to look like so we do anticipate there will be further issues with the supply there so they 're some of the main ones and as you can see they 're all really significant for businesses over Tina about some of the challenges as well to that I guess Lauren 's pretty much covered them well but I think there is an emerging challenge now for businesses in terms of as we move out of the sort of crisis and into recovery mode and start to try and bring open businesses you know what are the challenges going to be in terms of how what those businesses might look like and certainly those in the service industries how do they maintain you know social distancing for businesses how do they keep their employees safe within their work environments and maintain good hygiene and things like that so they 're going to be challenges for businesses moving forward and you know we see part of our role is helping to help guide and navigate businesses in facing that prospect and what they might need to do can I dive into that a bit further as well Lisa I mean you 're obviously managing the crisis team what sort of advice to your business advisors provide to individual businesses so for example the business that said look I 've got time being you know how does your business adviser sort of help individual businesses so I guess the key is its individual advice so not all businesses are the same and certainly within same industries there is quite a lot of variance in terms of you know what cash cash at hand a business might have what 's their financial position how much exposure do they have to dish and things like that so we really take it based on the individual circumstances for a business we do have business advisors who 've got strong financial skills we 're certainly not in a position where we can provide the same level of financial advice as an accountant but we do start to sort of look at kind of what are your options also what are your options to trying to innovate and look at other ways of delivery within your current existing business model and what are some of your best options so that you 're making I guess informed decisions at a period of time with the information that you 've got we 've had to be very specific our focus because things have changed so rapidly we 've kind of sort of said we 'll think about what you can do from now for the next month and then reassess so there 's been a lot of that reassessing what your position is where things are at and making decisions then based on that so that kind of short step iteration so business planning and sort of thinking for the future has been really critical if I could start with one of the questions that we get through the business engagement program and we 've actually afforded many of these businesses to the crisis center one of the key issues and you 've sort of touched upon this Laura and is around the job keeper payment are you able to sort of summarize what 's available for small businesses and advise what to do businesses are unsure about their eligibility so I can answer that one so with job keeper it 's been a payment that has also had a lot of changes and different extensions to time and it has been a very confusing payment for people off to the ATO they 've been trying to release information and they have released a series of guides that are available on their website for people who are sole traders of companies to really guide them through the whole application process basically for those who are aware as job keeper obviously was announced on the 30th of March it 's a 1,500 subsidy to employers to incentivize them for keeping their staff in employment each has some criteria around as a business to qualify you must demonstrate that you 've had at least a 30% reduction in your to turn on your mother and that basically can be done using two different tests so the basic test which is what the ATO uses is comparing your turnover for the month for example of April this year to your turnover as it stood in April 2000 and 19 alternatively you could also use a quarterly period so you can use April through to June as your quarter and compare what your forecasted actual and forecasted turnover is expected to be with that same period last year for businesses that weren experiencing you know actual increases in turnover prior to cravin 19 but up since been impacted they too can apply they would just use a different test and that 's called an alternative test and ATO website has information about what they would need to demonstrate and basically the Tax Commissioner there would be use his or her discretion to ensure if they 're applicable they can get the payment as well it 's open to sole traders partnerships and companies directors so one director one beneficiary and one partner can also apply for the job keeper payment a lot of people aren 't aware of that so far we 've received some information from the ATO there 's about sixty seven thousand employers that have signed up in wa4 job keeper as of today but predominantly are they are sole traders so there is a number particularly in the partnerships and trusts that aren 't potentially aware that they can qualify there are some dates around when you can get paid so the big key thing for eligible employees is that you must have been paying them since the have if you want to claim that back from the ATO you have until tomorrow is the line to show you through your single touch payroll that you 've actually paid those employees the 1500 since the 30th of March for the first two fortnight 's in April now if you miss that that 's okay you miss the first two fortnight 's of being reimbursed but you 've still got until the end of May to put in applications and you can and you can still receive there 's different dates that we can make available on your website machine from the ATO but there 's different dates that you need to meet to just show that you 've paid your employees up to that time the job keeper payment is paid a month in arrears so that 's something that businesses do need to ensure they 've got the cash flow to be able to still pay employees during that time the probably big question we often get asked is you know is this a before tax or after tax payment it 's a before tax payment so tax obligations you still are required to pay superannuation to your employees as well and that is on top of the 1500 if you 've got a casual employee or an employee who generally would earn less than the 1500 per fortnight it 's up to you whether you want to pay superannuation based on their ordinary pay or if you would like to pay them additional super contributions based on the 1500 per fortnight but none of those other employer obligations go away with job keeper payment we still must ensure you do that I guess one of the key things for anybody who is still unsure or interested we actually have a webinar running this evening from 5 to 7 p.m. I think registrations for that closed at 00 p.m. but it 's all on the job keeper payment and what you need to do to demonstrate your eligibility and how to apply so I would strongly encourage people to register for that and they can find that by just googling SBDC Eventbrite and all B 's on there so yeah pretty much job keeper Cayman one of have registered for job keeper payment you must ensure that you have got a record of formally informing your employees you 've nominated them the ATO website has got that form but also on our website we 've got a job keeper payment blog and we 've got a link to that actual form that you can use now the ATO doesn 't need that form to be sent back to them but they do require you to keep it as part of your records so that 's also something that employers need to do and there are penalties if you don 't do that so that 's something to be aware of thank you so much I mean I think you 've covered a lot of the queries that business is actually having around you know some caveats around the job keeper payment particularly around the fact that you know you may not have someone that you 're paying 1,500 to and also you know some of those aspects do you think there 's and this is just inquisitive from mine it 's in place for six months until can demonstrate that their thirty percent down well do you think this would be something that would continue from I think the federal government is very much aware that recovery is going to take a long period of time initially when this was announced it 's obviously I was for a six-month period and I believe that they will review the situation probably in the next few months to see where a majority of their businesses across Australia are act and no doubt if the support is required to be continued they will accept that I have another query that 's come in from a business so what they 've said is I have staff register doing the job keeper scheme this has required me to go back to get a bank loan to pay the staff while I wait for funds to coming from the ATO I have to pay interest on this loan can I ask that offset that against my tax liability at the the financial year in terms of yeah yeah so so the bank line so interest on your bank loan or your business loan and they are often offset against your tax liability at the end of the year it 'd be no different in this case and if you 're unsure just speak with your tax agent or your accountant if you have one to to confirm but generally speaking yes you 'd be able to offset it okay that 's good another question the state government you 've introduced the state governments introduced a new legislation in relation to commercial lasers and carbon 19 this is being you know we 've had so many inquiries particularly for from tenants but what does this mean for landlords and tenants yes so earlier in April the federal government announced a national code of conduct for commercial leases and it was then up to their each state to determine how that would be enacted and enabled in each state so our state government two weeks ago released new legislation for commercial leases and we are still currently waiting on the actual regulations and the version of the double a code that will help guide some of those conversations our understanding is our code is not until it actually goes through I don 't have a lot of details on that as it currently stands the there are some protections for tenants in terms of some actions that are prohibited by the current legislation as it stands which landlords can 't do for a period of time and up until the end of September this year so that includes things like they can 't evict somebody for non-payment of rent they can 't possess premises they can 't terminate leases and they certainly can 't increase rents during this period and there 's a number of other things like using ons or guarantees to try and recover any unpaid rent is also prohibited at the moment in relation to two tenants they are still required to to negotiate with landlords about their obligations so they 've got a contractual obligation through their lease to pay rent obviously their finances might mean that they 're unable to do that our recommendation is that businesses don 't you know just stop paying rent and stop communicating with their landlord or the managing agent it 's really important that through this period so we encourage landlords and managing agents to start coming to the table about providing rent relief and we also encourage tenants to ensure that they 've got their financials in order to demonstrate the impact that they 've had from covert 19 so that they can actually provide evidence to the landlord and managing agent about the impact and also I guess negotiating around what you know they 're prepared to pay or how they 're prepared to work through it it 's it 's supposed to be a shared burden and it 's trying to work through that and I know that we 've encountered a lot of people where they 've stopped communicating or just decided to do something unilaterally without communicating with the other party and I think it 's important that all parties to the lease continue negotiations we 're hopeful that in the next two to three weeks the regulations and the code will be released that will then have some mandated requirements for for the parties to actually comply with and we will then also have the option to provide they are not able to resolve the matters great thank you for that I have another one on job keeper it 's a very common one so I would probably say to the attendees as well if you want to follow up session definitely go to the SPDC session that 's on this evening and we can share the details of it as well if that helps but this one 's for you again the cash flow payment scheme allows up to about fifty thousand and I don 't receive the maximum amount okay so the cash flow boost is not so much job keeper that 's a different incentive or stimulus package measure through the ato and that 's based on your pay as you go withholding amounts so you get a hundred percent back of what you 've claimed so up to a maximum of fifty thousand so if your pay-as-you-go withholdings only say twenty thousand then you 'll never get the fifty thousand you 'll get back the amount that you 've paid but if you are a larger employer and you 've got pay-as-you-go with Holdings normal reporting on your best statements to the ATO they work out the eligibility and they will credit your account based on on what they 've been able to assess you for right another one that 's come through as businesses move to reopen should we be promoting DHA Australian hotels association of hospitality and tourism Cove in hygiene course that has become mandatory with floor opening so yes basically that is a requirement that 's been announced at state government level for those businesses to undertake I know that the Tier one workshop is currently available online it 's free and it 's fairly easy for people to work through it 's I believe the Tier two workshop is yet to be have made available and I guess because we realize that that 's something that needs to be in place before people can open will be sort of following that up but yes certainly being hygiene aware is really critical not only to satisfying your customers and clients that you 've got the right safety measures in place but it 's also it becomes part of your workplace was just having a look at that earlier and you can actually register now so even if you the tier 2 is not available at least register now that 's one of the things that all hospitality businesses can and should be doing right you know right now to help prepare for when everything so all the restrictions are eased awesome no that 's great and we 'll send that out to our businesses as well and encouraging them to do that right now as well and I think the other opportunities is that we had a conversation with destination Perth last week where a member of destination person they 've suspended their membership fees are encouraging tourism businesses to go on as their members free of charge as a silver member and the reason why I 'm saying this is because through our business engagement program we 're getting lots of businesses asking to be promoted so you know they 've all of a sudden overnight have had to shift from being an open restaurant or an open cafe where they have to do delivery and take away only take away W a line to tourism waa and also destination person I encourage many of our businesses who are probably this forum that definitely go on to our website write to us and looking want to that campaign and we encourage you to be promoted through destination Perth because there are local promotional agency for tourism and hospitality oh cool I have one more question that 's come through oh so how about we make this a regular event to provide motivation and support for small business operators what do you guys think well the idea initially we were just talking about that um was it there you go about that and I think this kind of forum has been used by other groups as well I think it 's really good everyone to connect and I 'm you know we 'd love to be involved in something like that whether you know whether it 's every Friday with a beer in hand from your lounge room who knows yeah absolutely Thank You Clyde for your comments because very very well we 'll see if we are looking at I also want to put a shout out to our local doing a lot Business Association um who run regular coffee connections every Thursday from 11 to 12 and they also run a fortnightly quarantine II so that 's been really really well received from so that 's the intention basically a martini every fortnight on the desk new way of life another question I have the time but not the fast cash flow to focus on boosting my own skills what resources are available to me that a low cost I can jump in there and I think the businesses in Perth probably quite fortunate that there are quite a few resources that they can access at the moment for free and you know they 've got a lot of time because unfortunately they can 't_''_1788.809 be running their businesses so it 's a really good time thinking about that at the SBDC we have a whole suite of training available training and resources so you mentioned our workshops but we 've also got access to learning portal that 's got Lisa you can confirm the details of this resources as well and I know the city of joondalup has a number of great programs as well so I 'd encourage all the businesses to check out the security lives website and check out you 've got the forum and the programs that you 've got running at the moment so there is a lot out there that that 's free or low-cost it 's that businesses could access yeah and I guess turn to that Lauren absolutely we 're currently in the middle of running our business really programs these are three accelerated programs aligned to our economic development strategy and that 's really focused on how do i as a tourism hospitality business destination really what sort of tourism experiences do i have in place i have a unique value proposition for my business do I have a loyalty programming place you know what can I do to increase virtual footfall now into my business and that 's being run by very very young Nelson on behalf of us who 's a local Joondalup resident and then we have a digital program which is about supporting businesses the right systems in place in my business do I have the right digital channels do I have a proper website or do I have a proper Facebook site so this is a small digital transformation process which we have ten businesses involved in and the third and that 's being delivered by Silvana Macri from Stacey a cyber and another big part of it is how do I become sad or resilient one in three businesses are being hit by cyber security are being cyber attacked or have a threat of attack and 80 to 90 percent of them I think that 's the right statistics call not robot will not recover if they 're attacked so it 's about ensuring that the businesses have the right size already systems in place to be cyber secure cyber safe basically so that 's the intention of this program and the third element is how do I become global ready being globally it 's not just about going overseas being lovely ready is about do I have the right things in my business to really increase my opportunities to a global we 're importing from business as a business are from international markets so how do I have the right mechanisms in place so I can negotiate cross-culturally regulations do I need to be looking at so that 's the purpose of getting globally ready and that 's being delivered by Marco Carter and Aaron Levie from CC IWA so for our future forums as well we would love we 're hoping on some of the businesses who have been impacted and bringing our presenters to share some of the work that they 've been doing to transform the businesses the business ready program is free of cost and we 're looking at setting up another round and to be honest the response we 've got has been phenomenal because it 's all of a sudden given that attention you know we design these programs pre pro feed but right now what we 're getting is that time and their energy where the business is actually focusing on how do I make sure I 'm resilient how do I emerge and that 's been the focus of what so I 'm up and taking on the challenge and it 's not being an easy journey there are going to be a lot of hard questions you know am i doing the right thing marketing budget you know those kind of things that that propped up with the businesses and it 's a whole transformation process so it 's been really exciting to see Marian I have another question so the SBDC you guys have spoken to a huge amount of businesses as you were talking about can you share any examples of business interest during this time to continue trading during the history yeah thanks mashite and yeah I mentioned that we 've had you know a lot of calls and in amongst all the challenges there 's a whole heap of really heartening stories of business of greatness who are being in an innovative and adaptive and you know we 're so proud of these businesses who have managed to turn things around sometimes that in some cases they 're actually making more money which is just amazing so some of the innovative things that we have been seeing you can do takeaway but now they doing you know delivery boxes of you know food and wine to their residential customers you 've got wineries in in the Swan Valley that delivering hampers do i bread do i pasta cheese and wine we 've got wineries down south who are making hand-sanitizer wise winery down south I 'm making for example we 've got catering companies who as a result of the you know social distancing and events now their business has come to a grinding halt there 's no weddings being planned so they have now turned to you know food and meals for families and delivering you know just reheat yourself and feed your family so that that 's a really clever we 're seeing businesses finding new customers that they didn 't have before what 's been most in heart heartening has been the embracing digital and you know we 're all probably you know we 're using zoom now I had never personally used them before we 've got businesses using zoom and teams and you know all the other platforms out there to communicate with physio sessions being delivered remotely you know tele health is being delivered remotely we 're seeing businesses that may have had a website before but not an online shop so it 's almost forced their hand to have an online shop and they 're able to in some cases make more money than before and so I anticipate that the changes that they have made they ruled out that 's their business model moving forward so really brilliant and I think you know upmarket they went digital for the first time ever and we 've got you know some business types that because everyone 's at home now not doing stuff there 's been a bit of a boom I went to my local nursery was the first time I really left the house to be honest other than the grocery store I went to the local nursery and it was you know there stocks were so low I was so worried of my gosh they 're you know another victim of covert and they 're gonna close no they had just been they 'd been so many sales that with supply so you 've got some really interesting stories out there and I think bracing embracing digital technology and finding me customers rather than supplying to restaurants say they 're you know now supplying to the home the residential customers so I think there 's been a lot of opportunity and I it 's not as if you know time 's up I think there 's still time for businesses to see what 's work for the businesses and trying to adopt that for themselves yeah that 's great Lisa did you have anything to add to that no I think it 's been interesting every business is slightly different and I think you know we 've seen with a lot of the cafes and the services that people catch really rethink and get creative and I think if anything for the ones that have been able to sort of pivot their businesses and look at different models I think it 's been an amazing opportunity for them and as we said once things go back I think those businesses are going to be ahead of the game a of go well if I want to keep operating and I 've got these expenses you know how do I do that probably the nicest thing that we 've seen through this is that real small businesses looking after other small businesses and we 've seen it in local communities and we 've seen it with people looking after their suppliers so they 've worked together to look at well how do I help keep you in business by doing something different in mine or how can you help me in my business and I think that 's been really it doesn 't surprise me because small businesses are quite very generous with their time and knowledge and quite willing to share with people but I think it 's brought the small business community closer together and I think anyways that locally you can share and support one another even if it 's by making a referral to someone or whatever it might be I think you know certainly encourage that to happen because I think that 's really key to keeping you know your local communities vibrant and and and I think in talking to a lot of the businesses I think there 's a lot of resilience in there as well I think there is that reality check out some of them where for example they 're a team or a fitness center which is being really interesting the yoga well-being centres where they 're shut down but they 're offering a lot of things online I mean we 've had some brilliant cases where businesses have retained their customers almost a hundred percent while offering their their training their judo centers etc all online and where she 's putting together a campaign right now to help promote those businesses through our community well-being Network so that 's one of the things that we want to do because it is about looking at wellbeing for people for our community and there 's that sense of connection there what I 've seen as well is some of our local hotel operators which have just re innovated themselves and created rooms for self isolation and being able to quarantine during pervade and they 've really really changed their model and occupancy rate but in mind of the safe safety and the well being and really increased hygiene standards and I think that 's been really well regarded across the business community I think that 's been that 's been very big for us yeah as well yeah and there was one example I know Jim 's and you mentioned there you know being closed and so they saw an opportunity because so many people were buying you know dumbbells and things like that they 've actually hired their equipment so people drop to their homes and who are now hiring their equipment seeing that otherwise was just sitting there idle and they 're making money off you know renting out their equipment so I guess it 's just yeah thinking of different ways to offer a service yes absolutely I don 't mean the other thing has been the support for health workers has been phenomenal I think I was I was actually watching a movie the other day and I sort of thought you know here are these people that we look up as heroes in our lives and workers who are there and you know people working in Coles and Woolworths who are really taking on risk and you know we are fortunate to be in w.a where we 've got with it 's coming you know it 's coming to an end in that sense of one era of it in terms of the health crisis fingers crossed but you know I really really appreciate a lot of the businesses who are there to support many of those health workers and people in need so I think you know that 's been something that has been really heartwarming to see campaigns that individual businesses are putting out to help fundraise or have a free coffee pay for a free coffee for a health worker it that helps residents also engage in that as well I might just open it up to see if there 's any more questions but also I guess another question is is to you guys and running the crisis center as well if there 's common issues or is there you know if there 's recurring issues that businesses are facing is there are you guys playing an advocacy role in all of this as well yeah yes we are and I think that 's been part of our core for you know since we were established really that advocacy roles something that we feel strongly about and it 's something that we believe is a really important part of our organization so my team in particular do a lot of advocacy and it 's funny funny not funny and we 've been advocating for a while for reforms and now you know it 's happening so for ages we 've been trying to advocate for faster payment times to businesses and you know not only big businesses but government too you know we believe that we should be acting how we want you know other organizations set so the it was just just this week you know just recently it 's been announced that that 's going to be happening in to come to finance they 're going to be moving to 20-day payments and by mid-may I believe and I think there is a plan for that to extend to across it 's like yeah we can kind of to check that off as a win so yeah we certainly are advocating for where things there 's gaps one of the things we were hoping to advocate for was the road houses as we mentioned so yes certainly and one thing that works really well is that Lisa 's team of advisers they you know front of line they 're taking the calls they 're responding to the inquiries so where they can hear some of the issues they feed it back our team where we then try our best to add the K to all tiers of government really and my manager sits in there meeting weekly now there 's a couple of big working groups across government who are focused on the economic impact and economic recovery what that will look like so yes we have a key role in those working groups and their small business commissioner is a big focus team at the moment thank you so we might be getting a bundle of different points which we can work together on as we 're also gauging I would probably highlight which is which Waldo has underwritten which is the vendor marketplace in the panel marketplace which is an amazingly powerful way for businesses to get access to local procurement processes and government procurement processes so we have some information that we can send to you or if you want to engage with us through the business engagement program we can provide you with more information on how to get on those systems but there 's some great cases where you know you may be a small catering business but you actually start getting tractor traction with small opportunities and that could help you grow your business so that 's some of the work that we 're trying to do with vulgar and threw them at vendor marketplace so that would be an opportunity for local businesses as well I have a question from renee is the city of Joondalup providing any financial support in any way ET rate reductions so probably like many councils we 've set up a local recovery group community coordinating group and there is within that an economic subcommittee the city has number of different economic drivers they 're looking at to support the local business community so I don 't have a straightforward answer to that but I think that will be there 'll be a number of recommendations made that council will be making some decisions on hopefully soon so that 's where it 's at but what I do encourage you to do is write to us tell us about some of the ideas you may have which we can then flag up the chain for consideration as well did you learn that Lisa have any closing comments that you 'd like to make I 've just jump in I suppose one of the final comments I really want to make and it 's more of an opportunity for everyone that 's watching is that it 's we want everyone to you know get through this and so we 're really saying to think about recovery which is really really really great and probably happens sooner than you know well definitely other countries are recovering so now 's the time to start planning and planning is what 's really businesses to open quickly and if there 's you know a spike and whether they talk about wave two businesses are prepared for that so you know as as we 've mentioned there 's you know log on to hospitality hygiene comm register for the training also and encourage everyone to check out Safe Work Australia z website so though you 've been it 's been announced that they 're they 're going to be the primary source for information to get businesses prepares sorry there 's toolkits and information available on an industry by industry basis so that covers physical distancing personal protective equipment how to conduct risk assessments it 's got case study so have a look there that will help businesses create their own plan for how they can reopen in the new world where social distancing will be around for a while longer that is something that is really important and just a few other things and just think about what you can do you can reopen can you do some maintenance can you repaint were you planning something and you 've been putting it off your supply chain can you check your contracts also have just have a think about how it 's going to work moving forward because the more prepared you are now it will make it a lot easier for you to reopen when the restrictions are lifted and in particular tourists businesses and businesses that get a lot of the income from customers over east or overseas the Premier 's made it really clear that he doesn 't want to lift that you know east-west border for six months so I really encourage those businesses to try and build on you know leverage the sentiment across the community right now about supporting locally and train you know think about how they can pivot their marketing and focus on on the local customers right now look I think where there 's no roadmap for this this is all fairly new for all of us and so you know I encourage businesses to make use of you know the support networks that are out there for them through the city of Joondalup through people like Austrade through the Small Business Development Corporation we we 've we 've been operating for over 35 years we 've got business advisors who have walked in your shoes and run businesses themselves some of whom still do and only work for us a couple of days a week so these people are also familiar with what you 're going through and I guess throwing around ideas talking through some of these things with other people can sometimes help clear the fog and even be reassuring that you 're on the right track so you know these services are free you know whilst we 're experiencing a bit of demand we don 't put you through straight through to it to an advisor but we 're getting back to most people within certainly an advisory level for about the first 24 hours we 're back to everybody that we 've been contacted with and yeah it 's just a great opportunity to you know we 're there for you we 're there to support you we 're there to advocate on your behalf so please take up that opportunity if you need it you 're not alone through best we can thank you thank you very much so this I guess concludes our session for today and thank you so much Lauren and Lisa for being a part of this panel I really really appreciate it because I think there 's a number of Christians that businesses have and being able to bring this to them in this format has been great and it 's always great to talk to

    "text": "hey everyone i 'm darren and i 'm jihun and welcome to the sea of jade loves chop chop stories here each week we 're gonna be telling funny riveting and stupendous stories in a very unusual way that 's right we are going to share the storytelling I 'm gonna start with the line and then Darren will go Nick 's we 're gonna go back and forth so who knows where the story will end up and to make it even more exciting we can be using three weekly words that we have to use in our story say Darren there 's a lot of shimmering stars out it feels like I 'm in outer space that 's right jihun maybe they 're close to what this week 's three weekly words maybe and speaking of weekly words I have here a story written by Joseph Hamilton age 9 that contains last week 's three weekly words Wow cool Darren last week 's words were unicorn helicopter and Apple I can 't wait to hear your story Joseph okay is Joseph 's story in a land far far with a rainbow tail and a stripy mane the unicorn has lots of hobbies but in this favorite thing in the world is a best friend was a fairy her fairy best friend lives on the other side of the unicorn Ireland and it takes a long long time to get there one day there was a big storm on unicorn Island but it wasn 't a normal storm with rain it rained apples apples falling on your head can give you a big bug ouch the unicorn was worried because her very best friend was small and the unicorn was afraid her fairy best friend might get squished by the falling apples oh no what would she do she can 't fly there because she might get hit by the Apple storm I know she said I will fly my helicopter and rescue my very best friend so off she went to rescue her very best friends they came back safely to the unicorn house and had te of apple cake and crumpets the end that was an amazing story Joseph I really liked how the unicorn saved his else uses the three weekly was to write a story please send them into trouble chop stories and it might get rid out on next week 's show it looks about time to find out what this week 's weekly words are but we need the magical story hat before we can draw the words and here it is we also need a special guest to draw out the words and this week 's special guest is Andrew the idiot hi Andrea would you like to help me pick up this week 's weekly words from the magical story head there you go wonderful thank you very much Andrea now let 's see what this week 's weekly words down the first word is twinkle second word is spaceship and the last word is caterpillar twinkle spaceship and Caterpillar where does a story using the words twinkle spaceship and caterpillar even start I always find a good place to start is once upon a time okay Gina thanks once upon a time there was a caterpillar that lived on the moon he had big yellow spots all over his green one day there was a big fool UMP and the tallest spaceship the caterpillar ever seen crash-landed on the moon the door of the spaceship banged open and out stumbled a giraffe in a white spacesuit please set the draft oh I 've just come back from space supermarket and ran out a few on the way home now my spaceship is crashed down on this moon whatever am I going to do oh no said caterpillar I 'm so sorry to hear I 'm also sorry to let you know that I don 't have a spaceship so I can 't help you fly home the drought looks so sad and so down in the dumps and the caterpillar just had to think of something that she could do to help but what could she do it caterpillar set a thought and thought and thought and the greatest idea ever came to her which put a twinkle in her eye I know did you say you just went to the space supermarket yes I did sit the drop luckily most of my space groceries survived the crash I have lamingtons with a twinkle in her eye the caterpillar see I 'm going to need to eat all of it all of us all of it even my space lamingtons made with Jupiter chocolate and Venus coconut the caterpillar nodded well okay then if you think it 'll help set the draft you can start with my space bread No and the space milk and the space carrots and the spaced learning turns and they can appeal I ate all of the draft space groceries and got bigger and bigger and bigger and fell asleep the droplets been uncertain at the sizable snoring caterpillar he slowly moved forward to shake the caterpillar wait we noticed the most unusual thing bright purple wings were sprouting out of the caterpillars back and it wasn 't just the wings she was becoming a beautiful gorgeous radiant space butterfly the giraffe just stood there amazed staring with his mouth hanging open climb onto my back said the butterfly who was once a caterpillar I will fly you through space and all the way home oh thank you sit the drop climbing onto the butterflies at the black hole and onwards unto the Sun elegan wings butterfly soared into space and through a new friend hole be well that was a nice hella pillar helping out her new draw friends did you know that cat applause turned into butterflies gee hon I did when a caterpillar gets to a certain stage of their lives they spin a cocoon and they live in it for a few weeks and then they turn into a beautiful butterfly wow that 's really interesting and I know Elmo struts the stories in the words twinkle spaceship in caterpillar send them in we really love reading them I think

Deborah Underwood and I reach and it 's got some beautiful pictures at my range and they 're strong I love them all so let 's get started ready this first page is pretty important can you see what 's happening there so she 's caught a little ladybug with their cut and a card and it 's let it fly out the window all right remember that kindness is sometimes a cup and a card a letter a truck and a tree a screech and a cuddle a rake and a yard a cookie a carrot a key it 's seeds in a feeder a seat on a train see they 're giving their lady a seat Oh turn that way the builders are up there with the crane hi in the building the way down the street there 's other stuff going on see what 's going on here so it 's a daisy a peach or a pie a wave and a baker a boost on a crane a salmon shed up in the sky you see the workers of sharing their sandwich he 's sitting on the crane way up there way down here on the street chopping some daisies for peaches and look he 's waiting up there what a cool page all right let 's go back normal oh there we go that was really fun kindness is sometimes a tip in a case or a tap when the laces are tied it 's taking a photo or making some space Doug 's crux crossing me there you see duckies crossing the road it 's really exciting internet it 's a racket a rocket ride it 's dirt and a shovel petunias and pails it 's trees that will someday give shade trees its plant and a hammer its lumber and nails its houses and cold with someone who 's sad forgiving yourself when you made a mistake forgiving the friend who got mad do you see what 's happened in these pictures can you see what happened so the lemonade 's been dispute they 're both a bit upset I can imagine how upset they would be the spilling the lemonade but it 's okay they 've forgiven each other when they 're friends again it 's cuddling puppies it 's holding a door it 's a toy and a treat and a comb it 's seeing the animals others ignore its a leash and a lick and a home [Applause] kindness is sometimes a song or a stick or a hi and a bat and a ball it 's soup when a neighbor is sneezy and sick or a scoop if one happens to fall yummy ice cream ice cream makes a lot of things better doesn 't it it 's reading a story it 's feeding a fish it 's a bucket but a book in the yard doctor sharing books between the windows how cool is that oh I wish I could 's awesome it 's kissing a sister it 's wishing a wish it 's a bug and a cup and a card okay do you remember at the beginning when she let the little ladybird out the window yes again it 's in that nice so I hope you enjoyed that book and could see lots of different ways that people could be kind to each other now for a song it 's gonna be another kind action that you can do and then it 's making someone a cup of tea or coffee or maybe a yummy hot chocolate but before we do that we need to put the kettle on so we 're gonna sing it Polly put the kettle on okay Polly put the kettle on Polly put the kettle on Polly put the kettle on we 'll all have tea Sukey take it off again Sukey take it off again Sukey take it off again they 've all gone away shall we sing that one again together Polly put the kettle on Polly put the kettle on Polly put the kettle on they 'll all have again sinky take it up again they 're all gone away my friends bye-bye there 's another little tea so now we 're gonna sing seniors were in the mood for tea I 'm a little teapot you ready I 'm a little teapot short and stout here is my handle here is my spout when I get all steamed up then I shout tip me over pour me out I 'm a clever teapot yes it 's true here 's an example of what I can do I can change my handle to my spout just tip me over pour me out mmm yummy tea that was really good all right so today now I 'm gonna show you the crafts that we 're gonna make and in the book that we read earlier they made a nice little love card for the ladybug so what we 're going to do we 're gonna be making a kindness card and you can give it to a friend or a family member you can fold it up and pop it in the letterbox of someone maybe you haven 't seen just let them know you 're thinking of them so we 've got some instructions there very good instructions and a template of what we 're gonna be making to go kitty cats and you can find them on the website now just show you the finished product so here 's our little card and maybe you can put a little chocolate or a little treat or sweet tea on the front of your pod as well look at that is that beautiful as you can see so the instructions are very good very easy to follow but I 'll just show you a few of the steps so you can make it at home so where 's my place here we go so with the template you want to cut out four hearts you can use color paper or you can use plain paper and then you can color in the hearts so here is my heart that I 've already cut out like that then with two hearts of the same color put them on top of each other we fold them in half and then you get fold it out a little bit kind of use it a 3d effect now I 've finished my card and I 'm just gonna show you where I 've stuck all the bits on so that 's what I started I 'm gonna glue my little heart on now so when you 're choosing the colors that you want to do for your card maybe you can think about what sort of colors the person you 're giving your card lights and what 's their favorite card and maybe you can think about what your favorite color is use those colors as an inspiration what you 're going to do so you can do patterns and shapes as well so here we go I 've got my two balloons ready to go and then I 'm gonna put the banner between them now if you don 't have any string at home of course you can just draw a line between the two balloons and then stick your flags across that line but I 'm gonna show you how to do it with string when you 're choosing the word or you can do the person 's name so it 's up to you what you want to do anything will be pretty and good so here is my banner that I 've started I 'm doing the word hugs and to make the little triangle stick to the banner what you do it 's a little bit tricky but you put it on the end and you fold it up and then using some glue or sticky tape as you can see I folded the corner over there and then I 'm just gonna sticky tape it sticky tape it together so here we go and I 'll write the s there later then to stick it on my card and see you just stick each bit of the string underneath their balloon I 'm going to use sticky tape as I show you this example but you can use glue it will be a little bit you 've got it there we go isn 't that much then you can decorate the background with some of the clouds that we 've got in our template so you can you can even use some cotton wool balls if you cut it to make your clouds message Ruffy and you can decorate the front of your card however you want now the other step that you need to do is make an envelope for the card so if you don 't have an envelope already at home you can make one we 've got another template for that but I 'll show you very quickly that basically it looks like yes see this shape so you get a square get a piece of paper you put your card in the middle and you draw a square around it and then from each side a big semicircle and you cut it out then when you 've got the shape cut out you fool all the semicircles in to each other and then the loop so you can secure it out it 's sticky tape you can write your friend 's name on the front of the card and you can pop it in your letterbox maybe give it to someone in your family in your house and let them know that so that 's all we 've got time for today before we go we just like to say that books like the ones that we read today are really good to have come of that so making something that happened in a story to something that 's happening in your child 's life is a really good way to extend their literacy skills and reading a book and then asking questions about it later is a really good activity to just develop and extend those skills so kindness you can have lots of examples of what was kind today that you saw what can you do that 's kind what happened in that those pictures and ask your child to talk about what is happening in the pictures and what you what I think the characters are feeling in the book so that 's something to try at home when you 're reading at your next story together all right we 'll go now but before we go we have to sing her goodbye song which is open shut them all right open shut them open shut them give a in your lap creep them creep them creep them creep them right up to your chin open wide your little mouth ah do not let them mean roll them roll them roll them roll them roll them just like this shake them shake them shake them shake them blow a little kiss if I 'm making your card [Music] _"

's always good to see you in and a very warm welcome to everyone who 's here this morning now whilst um to to speak to me and Jacob about his speech which I really enjoyed and I particularly liked the start of it when we heard again about the world 's largest periodic table here in joondalup and nothing makes me smile more than but I 'm particularly interested in the fact that you have chosen them to be known as the city that has the world 's largest periodic table because I think that seems an incredible message to the community but also to our young people there are a number of statistics about the skills of the future and the need for science technology engineering and maths the figure that I tend to work with is 75% of the jobs of the future will require those skills whether they be in the pure sciences that pure maths or increasingly in the digital capacity what we do know is the young people and transitioning jobs will need strong daily skills if they are going to the best place for the jobs of the future so I 'm delighted that you have controls my just periodic table here I have two through my heavy like this thora Hird again this morning and that was I immediately reported a simple idea which is my speech because I 'm planning to use some of the statistics in that when I talk to other regions across Australia about how you have worked to develop your community here and how you are being well placed for the jobs of the future now I did have a prepared speech and I 'm probably not going to heard about to really start the conversations about the areas that are going to be important to us now I 'm going to start by talking a little bit about the portfolio that that I have then I 'm going to talk about how government is starting to work towards positioning the industries I 'm going to talk about the industries that we currently have some strengths in and some industries for the future and then I think we 'll go to the the panel so if I talk firstly about the portfolio that I have the the privilege of having responsibility for which is industry Science and Technology they starting to see some of the changes happening with government as we start to pull all those together and make sure that there 's integration at the very senior levels we do have the National Science and Technology Council that has been changed under the Morison government so it incorporates technology into that I will talk a little bit more specifically about technology and innovation given that that some that 's the main purpose of us being here but we 've started to put together Science and Technology we also have innovation and science Australia which was established as part of the National Innovation and Science gender the missing link in that is industry so we 're starting to look at opportunities to bring industry in so that we have industry and technology industry and science and science and technology working together because what we do know is that we are going to be able to achieve much more if we can bring those three key parts together so here in Joondalup I know that you already do a lot of work engaging with the education sector and industry we Western Australia and quite frankly all across Australia we also want to focus from an innovation perspective about not just startups which are a very important part of the innovation and technology sector here in Australia but also that the innovation the innovation that happens every single day by our small medium and large enterprises whether it 's looking at a new service a new system a new material a new production method that is all the innovation that we need to capture now I 'm sure there 's likely to be some some questions about the R&D tax incentive which is a key part of the initiative what the R&D tax and second incentive has not been successful at doing is driving inputs from business so what we are seeing over time spend my businesses in innovation is declining so we need to step up the money if that is being put into innovation by businesses but we also need to capture the work that is done in the non R&D tax incentive areas as well which is the day-to-day work that many of our businesses do so each work and we try and do something a little bit better that quite frankly is innovation and the unfortunate thing is that the innovation agenda in Australia really has focused over the last two to three years on startups yes we need to support startups but we all also need to look more broadly at how we can support businesses and drive the innovation that we need from my point of view that is bringing a closer relationship between industry and our education providers so that we have a very strong industry and research connection so you will see that starting to come from the government and we will continue to drive that but you will see a shift now obviously for some people they will see the shift away from a pure focus on startups as a negative thing I actually think it 's been a strategy that is long overdue and that we need to make sure that we are capturing all innovation through all levels of business right across Australia now for us to be able to do that we need to [Music] start the weekend we in this day me now as a female stem graduate myself the disappointing thing for me is that from the time that I study them until now there have been significant improvements in the number of women studying STEM subjects either at school or in universities it is patchy so there are some areas where there has been a significantly greater increase in women studying those subjects and going into those professions but in the area for example of mechanical engineering which is which is my area of specialization there hasn 't been significant changes now the reason that I want to make sure that we have more women in the workforce is that we know we have stem shortages so we know that given that women are underrepresented if we can put support into encouraging more women to study STEM subjects we have a fairly large base to start from that 's going to maximize the opportunities it should not be done at the exclusion of of males clearly who want to study stem we need to keep those levels up but we need to bring women up as stem ambassador professor Lisa Harvey Smith talked about the fact that across Australia there are some the figure she quoted was actually 331 different programs to encourage women to go into stem so those come from many businesses that are looking at how they can skill up for the their workforce for the the future there are initiatives from local governments state governments and from the federal government what Lisa Harvey Smith is now doing is looking at which of those programs are effective because when we have some 330 programs working across Australia I think it 's fair to say that we might not be maximizing the outcomes out of that I 'm very outcome focused so I 've specifically asked Lisa to look at which programs work so what you will see is a realignment at least from the federal government 's point of view over the coming months and years about how we 're going to look at focusing on our target area of increasing the number of women who are moving into STEM fields now interestingly when when I was at university and the other girl we were the to Karen 's from mechanical engineering neither of us really considered the fact that we were the only two women it was only when I went back to QUT a few years ago that I speaking to the vice-chancellor and I said well Karen and I must have been one of the first women to come through and they checked and said that Karen and I were the first two women coming through I don 't believe that in mechanical engineering those figures have changed significantly and what we need to understand is why hasn 't that changed and how we can address it so that 's going to be a target area as well as making sure that we understand we have the skills for the future now I have recently convened well probably over the last six months a number of roundtables with our manufacturers to look at how we can kick start again manufacturing right across Australia now it 's fair to say that we do have a fairly strong manufacturing sector here it is as an industry our seventh largest employer and there what we have done as a nation is we have tried to be all things to all people and that has meant that there are some opportunities for us to now look at where our strengths are and how we can maximise those opportunities our skills base is important makayley a 'cash and steve irons are doing some fantastic work in the vocational education space because we know there are some key shortages in that area they will continue to work in that area to maximise their skills mix is coming through and to focus particularly on our significant skill shortages so we need to pull together what the strong base is going to be work is happening on that and will continue to happen but I 've also talked to my manufacturing sector about what the opportunities are for develop key skills and we started from base of well historically Australia has always been a nation with strengths in agriculture and in mining and resources they are opportunities for us to continue and agriculture is now a very high-tech industry and of course mining particularly here in Western Australia if I can just digress for a little bit as part of the bushfire issues that we 've been facing I did convene a roundtable and one of the things that has come out of that is the need to look at autonomous vehicles for firefighting so that we can keep our firefighters off the frontline we will be looking to the mining sector that have key strengths in autonomous vehicles and operations to make sure that we can capitalize that and move that across to say ok well how can we send in autonomous vehicles to do our firefighting so there 's a real connection with what we 're doing so our core strengths our traditional strengths have been in agriculture and in mining and resources but what are our key strengths for the future now as I talk broadly across industry the things that are coming to the forth firstly let me start with the space sector which currently employs across Australia about 10,000 people it 's probably just a little bit over that at the moment given that the work that we 've been doing over the our plan and we have a plan in place to make sure that we get to these figures is to triple that sector by 2030 so that we will be tripping the number and an additional 20,000 people coming in to work in the space sector and to grow the sector to twelve billion dollars now many people get very excited about space when they focus on the launch capabilities that I 'm very excited that we are part of the NASA 's moon to Mars and potentially beyond program the money that we announced for that is staying in Australia we are not funding NASA they actually don 't need our money but what we do need to to do is make sure that we are supporting Australian businesses so that they can be part of the supply chain to NASA NASA is very interested in a number of issues and capabilities here in Australia certainly remote communications robotics and automation of course Western Australia is very well placed in those field fields remote health is an opportunity for us to support them so for example when we 've the Antarctic we actually run most of the health support from Hobart so that is going to be a very useful thing for NASA as they 're making sure that their astronauts and of course the communities of the future are going to be able to be safe and and well I just want to touch on one more thing about space before I move on and that is there is a lot of talk about mining on the moon this is actually not mining for profit this is actually mining so that we can generate the fuel that we need so NASA 's plan is to make sure that they build effect effectively a landing a pad on the moon so we will go to the moon that 's the first stage we will be mining we already know that there 's hydrogen we know that there 's well as water supplies up there now there 's hydrogen we know this oxygen up there on the moon we need to be starting to pull that out and generate the fuels that we need so there will be capability built to do is carry huge loads of fuel from Earth so we need to be able to make the fuel on the moon and that 's what we 're going to do we also don 't want to be taking a whole heap of equipment up there so we are looking at how well we are going to 3d print the landing station that is already well underway I visited NASA a few months ago now and they 're already starting to 3d print the furniture that 's going to be used up there so that capability is well advanced and the good thing is Australia as part of that so there are huge opportunities for us in space we just need to keep working on our strengths rather than try and be all things to all people have you got the message that I really love space it 's um it is really exciting but it 's not the only thing that Australia has some key strengths in so we 're certainly looking at the space sector manufacturing is very important to us but looking at what our key purely on price so when we look for manufacturing capability in Australia we are going to be looking at quality and effectively value for money so I understand that the circumstances that we currently are facing at the moment has put a very sharp focus on manufacturing and our capabilities here in Australia we will be looking at what our core capabilities are but we are going to be looking at where we can value add that leads to the technology and the innovation part of this because what we can do as a nation is start exporting our technology so even though we might not be making everything in Australia but we still will always be a nation that manufactures here we can export the technology so we can grow industry and university research capability is here in Australia and we can identify where those needs are overseas and we can start to feed into that we have some very strong strategic relationships with other nations we work very closely with Singapore we work very closely with Japan we have very strong relationships with China and India but we that will set us apart from the rest of the world so I guess in summary where we are placed at the moment is isn 't a positive territory we have some great strengths here in Australia we need to focus on what that capability is and we certainly need to be developing those skills now there are and many experts in the room today that have cyber security and cyber skills so I 'm not going to talk a lot about that I understand that will be well and truly covered in the panel session but as a government we understand how important it is that we build cyber skills just for the negative in terms of how we can make sure that we are at a lower risk of a cyber attack but how we can use the positive parts of the cyber certainly to protect Australia but also to build the industries of the future so to go back to where I started with the manufacturing one of the key skills that has been identified out of the roundtables is I need to make sure that we skills that we need here in Australia and I think that that is a very very positive opportunity for us other industries of the future are going to develop over time the Prime Minister has made it very clear that he wants us to be a world leading digital economy by 2030 so digitalization and digitization will be very important to us in developing those skills as we go he 's also made it very clear to future industry for us lies in plastic waste recycling not just to support our own needs here in Australia but to provide support for our Pacific neighbors so I hope I 'm giving you the very strong impression that Australia is very well placed there are opportunities for us to work closely together I think Joondalup clearly has some key strengths that I will be able to take with me as I visit other communities and talk about the work that you 're doing here you are ideally placed with your University and your very strong community support for innovation and science I thank you very much for that support I congratulate you [Applause] _"
